# Automatically generated index for MT evaluation from en into ka.
# This set of files disregards the effect of translationese (i.e. ka could
# have been the original language of the document)
# Multiple references can appear.
#
#
# TEMPORARY BUG: Accidentally, documents with only 1 file (i.e. missing one of
# the sides) might be also included).
#
# IMPROVEMENT NEEDED: Group files of a given document
# IMPROVEMENT NEEDED: Help SLTev know what is the source and what is the target
#
# BUG: If a language pair has multiple references but we get it in the reverse direction, we get *multiple sources*
