National Health and Hospital
Plan 2020–2023
Summary
The way forward is clear
“User participation is vital. Being listened to confirms that you are worth
something. That has both an intrinsic value and a therapeutic value. If
patients are allowed to influence their
own treatment, it confirms that they
are people with knowledge, understanding and a voice.”
These are the words of Dorte Gytri, after
her experiences as a patient receiving
mental health care. This is what we are
aiming for. We have a  shared vision
in the health service. We want to create a patient-centred health service.
Achieving this will require a great deal
of effort. It is a responsibility that is
shared by many.
In this second National Health and
Hospital Plan, we show how we will
­
develop a patient-centred health
service over the next four years. And
­
what we need to do to achieve it. One
of the main f­eatures is the establishment of 19  healthcare communities
(helse­fellesskap) in which hospitals and
municipalities will improve the way they
work together in caring for our most
vulnerable patients. A variety of parties
have been involved in developing the
plan – patients, r­elatives, healthcare
­personnel, ­hospitals, municipalities and
national health authorities.
I am looking forward to implementing
the plan together. Together, we will
take the next steps towards the target
of a patient-centred health service. The
way forward has never been clearer.”
Bent Høie, Minister of Health and Care
Services
National Health and
Hospital Plan 2020–2023
The National Health and Hospital Plan 2020–2023 sets the direction for the development of the specialist health service and the interaction with the municipal health
and care services during the period covered by the plan.
The aim is to achieve a sustainable, patient-centred health service. The patient’s
voice must be heard – not only when interacting with the people treating them, but
also in the development of health and care services. Patients should have equal
access to good-quality health services, no matter where they live. Patients and their
relatives should experience predictability, reassurance and continuity, and know
that professional help of high quality is readibly available - and how to access it.
We are a growing population, we are living to an older age and we expect more. This
makes it difficult to reconcile wishes and options within the limited resources at our
disposal. Limited access to healthcare personnel in particular will restrict the manner in which we are able to accomplish tasks. A sustainable health service therefore
requires us to utilise the opportunities provided by technology, make maximum use
of the skills of our employees and accomplish tasks as efficiently as possible.

Plan 2020-2023 (Meld. St 7 2019-2020). The summary describes the main aims in the
white paper, what the Government will do to achive them and provides examples to
illustrate the desired development of the healthcare service.

We learn from each other
The National Health and Hospital Plan is the government’s strategy for achieving a
sustainable, patient-centred health service. In a patient-centred health service, the
aim is for patients, relatives and healthcare personnel to experience the health and
care service as follows:
Patients are active participants in the healthcare they receive. Patients and relatives are
seen and listened to – with words they understand. Shared decision-making is the
norm, residents can communicate with the service digitally, and users have a say in
the development of the healthcare service.
Patients experience cohesive and coordinated services across hospitals and municipalities. Healthcare personnel complement each other, know what the next stage in
the patient journey needs and what it can contribute. Digital systems make their
National Health and Hospital Plan 2020–2023
work easier, not harder. Municipalities and hospitals work with users and GPs in the
healthcare community (‘helsefellesskap’) to plan and develop services.
Vulnerable patients feel that services are provided in a coordinated way which is centred
around them. Mobile, multidisciplinary teams take care of the most vulnerable children, young people and adults with serious and complex needs. Children and young
people with mental disorders receive services at the right level and at the right time.
Frail elderly people experience reassuring transitions.
Patients experience a coordinated chain of emergency care with intervention at an early
stage and information following the patient throughout. In accident and emergency
departments, patients are seen by staff with multidisciplinary skills who can quickly
assess them and provide the right treatment.
Patients receive more specialist health services in their own home. Specialist health services which used to require patients to attend appointments in person are provided
in patients’ homes, using technology. This is easier for patients and frees up time for
healthcare personnel to spend on other patients.
Patients find that with the use of technology, our health data is used to provide better
and more precise healthcare. Patients feel confident that information about them is
handled securely.
Healthcare personnel work in teams around the patient, develop services in line with
knowledge about what works, and utilise the opportunities provided by technology.
Healthcare personnel experience the health service as an attractive workplace which
facilitates lifelong learning for everyone. Good ICT systems makes their work easier.
Continuous improvement frees up more time to treat patients. Knowledge about
effective approaches is made known, so that valuable time is not spent on ineffective treatments.
Managers implement essential changes – working in partnership with staff. Major challenges require major changes – which must be managed. Managers are aware of
their responsibility to achieve targets, and have the support and flexibility they need
to take this responsibility.
We learn from each other. Healthcare communities and outreaching hospitals (‘utadvendte sykehus’) become arenas for learning. Skills are shared across teams and
between institutions. When initiating a new project, managers and staff ask “What
can we learn from others”? At completion, they ask “Who can we share this knowledge
with”?

develop better mental health services. The services meet the population’s total need for
mental health services in a sustainable manner. The patients recieve the services they need
at at the most appropriate and efficient level. Further development will prioritise improving
the quality of the mental health services. Key factors include better distribution of responsibilities between primary and specialist mental health services, collaboration, and taking
advantage of the possibilities provided by use of technology. Special attention should be
given to children, young people and users with serious and complex needs.

health trusts will review emergency medical services outside of hospitals in collaboration
with the municipalities, and the structure and management of hospital accident and emergency departments.
set the direction for the use of technology in the specialist health service, and adapt the
national framework around new ways of providing services. In the next strategic plans, the
health trusts will set their own targets for providing specialist health services in patients’ homes.
In order to develop better healthcare services, health data should be shared within
the healthcare sector to a greater degree than at the present.
ensure that there are sufficient and appropriate skills to meet future demand. The health
trusts should create a culture of full-time employment, and work to recruit and retain staff
in all personnel groups. They will facilitate lifelong career paths for all personnel groups,
with a particular focus on nurses and health workers. Further education courses for specialist nurses will be developed, and training capacity increased. The health trusts will accept
more healthcare apprentices. Simulation will be employed for training purposes to a greater
extent. Health trusts and municipalities in the healthcare communities will set targets for
skills ­sharing.

value of digitalisation lies in what it can mean for the services received by patients. ICT development will be managed and coordinated more clearly.

shift the growth in resources in the specialist health service away from simply employing
more staff, which is a scarce commodity, to investing in technology and skills which could
reduce future demand for healthcare personnel.
How will we achieve this? 9
The patient as an active participant
Our vision
The patient’s needs serve as a guide when developing health and care services.
As a matter of course, the patient is asked “what matters to you?” when decisions are made. The patient is an active participant in their own health and treatment. Good tools for shared decision-making have been developed for a range
of conditions. Healthcare personnel take the patient’s level of health literacy into
consideration and adapt their communication accordingly. Patients with longterm health problems and needs for assistance from the specialist health service receive better and more customised training to empower them to manage
their condition. Digital solutions are integrated as elements of this training and of
the communication with the specialist health service. Communication between
WHERE DO WE
the patient and the specialist health service is comprehensible – it is clear who
a patient is to see and when, what preparations they
must make, and what they can expect at the hospital.
Those in need of interpretation services, will receive
these more readily and with higher quality by increasing the use of remote interpreting services. Digital
residents’ services make it easier for residents to
monitor their own health and customise their contact
with the health service around their life.

Plain language in patient letters
A survey at Helgeland Hospital Trust showed that 10–20 per cent of kidney patients
and patients needing bowel examinations had not prepared for the examination/
treatment. As a consequence, only parts of the procedure could be performed, or
the appointment had to be rescheduled. So that more patients could come better
prepared, new patient letters were developed for these patient groups, using plain
and understandable language and graphics which make it easier for patients to
understand how they should prepare for the examination. Helgeland Hospital Trust
will start using the new patient letters in 2019. The goal is to have fewer cancelled
appointments and enquiries from patients needing clarification.

A cohesive and coordinated health
and care service
Our vision
Patients and relatives experience a cohesive and coordinated health and care
service, in which patients can be active participants in their own health and treatment. A strong culture for cooperation and coordination has been established,
and a mutual understanding of what health trusts and municipalities need
to collaborate on and how to do this. Health trusts and collaborating municipalities meet as equal partners in the healthcare community. They work with
users and GPs to develop and plan services for vulnerable patient groups who
need services from both levels. Suitable management information and shared
forecasting tools help to ensure the same understanding of the situation and
support joint planning. Health trusts and municipalities enter into agreements
on locally adapted ways of meeting the need for health and care services to
bring maximum benefit to patients. The Norwegian Directorate of Health provides useful guidance on local flexibility and how to organise this collaboration.
The Parliament (Stortinget) reviews the National Health and Hospital Plan every
four years, using this to communicate expectations to the healthcare communities regarding the development of health and care services.
The patient journey across municipalities and hospitals is typified by good
handover procedures which provide patients and relatives with predictability and reassurance, the opportunity to have two-way consultations between
healthcare personnel, and ICT systems which support coordination. Knowledge and experience are used to develop the patient journey. Multidisciplinary, multi­-level teams look after the needs ofWHERE

needs where appropriate. Specialist health services work with municipal health
and care services to see more people in their own
homes, and share their skills – both in person and
virtually. Legislation for information sharing, financing schemes and management data is adapted to
suit these working methods.

The government aims to establish 19 healthcare communities across municipalities
and hospitals, based on the same regions as the health trusts. In these healthcare
communities, representatives from health trusts, municipalities, local GPs and users
will meet to plan and develop services together. Existing agreements and structures
for cooperation will be used as a basis, but will be developed further. GPs should
have an advisory role, the municipalities in the health trust regions should improve
the way they work together, and national authorities must be clearer in their expectations of what municipalities and hospitals should achieve in the new healthcare
communities. National authorities will support the healthcare communities through
better management information and projection tools, and by introducing measures
which improve the patient journey.

changes to the structure of municipalities which will be effective from 1 January 2020.

Partnership with municipality
One of the goals of the patient-centred health service is for the specialist healthcare
services to be provided closer to where the patients live. We must create outreaching hospitals. Specialists in big hospitals will assist specialists in smaller hospitals
which are closer to the patient, specialists from hospitals will work with municipal
healthcare staff in municipal arenas, and hospitals will help patients in their own
homes in person or by the use of digital solutions.

Hospital at home
Oslo University Hospital provides hospital services at home for patients who have
had bone marrow transplants for leukaemia. Patients can stay at home instead of
being kept in isolation in hospital while their bone marrow function is returning to
normal. A specialised team of nurses and doctors monitor the patient daily in their
own home. The patient and their relatives are all satisfied, it takes less time for bone
marrow function to return to normal, and fewer antibiotics are needed. The nutrition situation is also better for patients who are treated at home than for those
treated in hospital, and few people need to stay in hospital.

Mental health care
Our vision
Patients participate in informed choices about treatment, based on their own needs
and resources. Patients are routinely asked about their experience of the service,
and this information is used actively in the continuous improvement of the service.
Services are provided near patients’ homes. The specialist health service offers webbased treatments which are accessible all over the country.
The services work together to provide high-quality mental health services, regardless
of level. The healthcare communities plan and develop the services they offer. Planning is made easier by use of shared forecasting tools and relevant management
data. Mental and somatic health and addiction problems are seen in context, and
treatment plans take into account the significance that work has on health.
The specialist health service improves the way it targets those with the most extensive need for care, and supports and guides professionals providing municipal services. Municipalities provide services to those with mild and moderate mental health
problems. Specialists in private practice under public funding contracts are well integrated in the public services offered.
It is easy for children, young people and families to get access to assistance. Helsenorge.no provides a list of a wide range of self-help solutions and web-based treatments. Mental healthcare is integrated in health centres and school health services,
child welfare services, kindergartens and schools. The specialist health service and
municipal services work well together on intervening at an early stage with children
and young people, and everyone receives services at the right level.
Children, young people and adults with severe mental illness receive a full range of
services from relevant parties, with a reduction in unwarranted variation of services

to prevent crises, emergency admissions, suicides and use of force. Ambulant services and use of teams together with the municipalities have been expanded. Anyone who needs it is offered a user-controlled place. The specialist health service has
an outward looking and flexible approach, resulting in fewer people needing to be
admitted overnight. Hospitals provide overnight beds for those who need them in
well-designed buildings. The use of force is reduced to a minimum.
When a person needs help, it is quickly decided who should do what, and when.

Clarify capacity and organisation
There are currently major geographic variations in activity in mental health care. If
current activity is used as a basis for projecting future needs for services, we risk perpetuating the geographic variation in services. We need a better analysis of needs
and a clearer distribution of work between the various parts of the service in order to
project the need for day care and residential services, outpatient clinics and ambulant
services. The Norwegian Directorate of Health and regional health trusts will work
together with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and Norwegian Association of
Local and Regional Authorities (KS) to deliver an analysis of the population’s future
needs for mental health services. The analysis and recommodations will also include
the future need of services of the Sami population. The Government will continue to
prioritise mental health care and multidisciplinary specialist substance abuse treatment. The analysis and projections of the future need for services will be the basis for
developing a more targeted way of measuring this prioritisation.
Cooperation on better residental options and services in Skien
There are groups of patients who find it difficult to live in standard accommodation,
and who have a major need for services from their hospital and home municipality. Skien municipality and Telemark Hospital Trust work together to provide safe,
good-quality services to each one of these patients. The plan is to establish municipal
accommodation within the hospital’s area, enabling the hospital and municipality to
work together to develop reassuring, good-quality services for every patient. This
will enable better integration between the services provided by the hospital, and the
follow-up provided by the municipality. Another goal is to facilitate meaningful work
and leisure activities.
A working group will clarify the schedule, scope of the service and where the homes
could be built. The hospital and municipality will agree on criteria for obtaining
access to these homes.

Fastest treatment in the world for strokes
Every year, around 12,000 people in Norway experience a stroke. Speed of treatment has a major impact on the future health of stroke victims. By systematically
using simulation training, Stavanger University Hospital has reduced the median
time from when a patient arrives in hospital until they receive thrombolysis from 27
to 13 minutes. No other hospital in the world has reported a shorter median time.
The teams train in improving the efficiency of the entire stroke treatment chain,
from the time someone dials 113 and the patient is brought to the hospital’s accident and emergency department, where they are x-rayed and thrombolysis treatment initiated. The simulation training deals with human factors, teamwork and
communication with the patient and team. System improvements and cutting down
on anything that wastes time are key factors in this training. Former stroke patients
play the role of patients in the training.
Better emergency preparedness and healthcare in the Røros area
The Røros project is a partnership between St Olav’s Hospital and the municipalities
in the Røros area. The municipalities and hospital use modern technology like mobile
sampling, video systems and other telemedicine technologies to perform advanced
diagnostics in patients’ homes. This saves patients from unnecessary admissions or
trips to the emergency primary care centre. Healthcare personnel provide services
across levels, irrespective of where they are employed.
National Health and Hospital Plan 2020–2023
The Røros project aims to help:
health trusts and municipalities work together on local emergency preparedness and use ambulance personnel for other relevant health service tasks in
the local community.
personnel involved in emergency preparedness with a low incidence of emergency assignments to use their downtime to address elements of the municipality’s and health trust’s preventive and health-promoting work in the municipality.
remove or reduce barriers between sectors and administrative levels, GPs,
emergency medical centres, other municipal medical resources and ambulance
services to form a complementary, competent, dependable resource for emergency response and healthcare in the local community.
A better chain of emergency care by sharing competence
The treatment patients receive before they get to hospital can have a major impact
on their outcome. The Emergency Chain Project in Telemark emphasises the importance of improving and developing cooperation with the municipalities in order to
create a better emergency health service. The project involves Telemark Hospital
Trust, the ambulance service, Emergency Medical Communication Centre (EMCC),
emergency medical centres, GPs, municipalities and other parties. Improving skills
in the municipal health and care service is an important part of the project. The
staff in the home care service play a key role, because they tend to be the first to
see the patient. They receive training in assessing emergency situations and learn
procedures for handling a range of situations. The staff in the home nursing service
have been provided with bags of emergency equipment which makes them better
prepared in emergency situations.
Emergency medical services 25
Technology in a patient-centred
health service
Our vision
Services which used to require patients to come to the hospital or meet healthcare personnel in person are now provided to patients through video consultations, follow-up based on patient reported data and sensor technology, and
by web-based treatment programmes. For vulnerable patient groups, medical
equipment is taken to them – not the other way around. Patients feel that
they are better able to cope, that they are receiving a more tailored service
and that changes in their health are picked up at an earlier stage. Patients
and healthcare personnel avoid unnecessary journeys. The directorates provide essential guidance on regulation, digital requirements and professional
guidelines. Financing schemes facilitate the development and introduction of
new working methods and new technology.
Artificial intelligence makes it possible to utilise national medical databases to
provide faster and more accurate diagnostics, better treatment and a more
effective use of resources. The regulations make it possible to use medical
data to bring maximum benefit to the community, the directorates provide
guidance on legal restrictions, and ethical problems associated with the use
of artificial intelligence are handled in cooperation with other European countries. The health and care service has established a culture of innovation and
knowledge-sharing, and works closely with businesses to develop the tools
needed by the service and patients.

People with spinal cord injuries are monitored via video
When I talk to the people in Sunnaas via the screen, it feels as if they are in my own home.
Because it is as if they nearby, it feels as if we are in close contact. I think it is wonderful.
– Ingar K Bergersen.
Since 2012, Sunnaas Hospital has been using video conferences to provide multidisciplinary follow-up for people with spinal cord injuries and pressure sores, in close
collaboration with the home nursing service in the municipality. A cost-benefit evaluation of this patient group showed that video consultations cost 15 per cent of what
physical meetings in outpatient clinics would cost, and only 3 percent of the costs
which would be involved in admission. The results so far show high patient satisfaction, some improvement in quality of life and a satisfactory level of sore healing.
Home dialysis with digital monitoring
Getting treatment at home instead of travelling to hospital several times a week gives
patients more freedom. Nordland Hospital Trust has been working with ­Telenor on a
solution to improve how patients using home dialysis are monitored. Patients record
their measurements on an app on their mobile, while weight and blood pressure are
recorded automatically. The kidney nurse at the hospital gets a faster picture of
the patient’s condition than when data has to be collected and registered manually.
Another benefit is that the medical personnel can be better prepared when they see
patients – whether that is over the phone or in person.
Technology in a patient-centred health service 27
Artificial intelligence in cancer treatment
The goal of the DoMore! project at Oslo University Hospital is to automate analyses
of pathology images of cancerous tumours. This is achieved by using artificial intelligence, in the form of deep learning, to process high volumes of images. The image
shows a tumorous area marked by a computer using deep learning. The green line
was marked by a pathologist, the blue line by a computer. The computer finds the
tumour and predicts the patient’s prognosis with a high degree of accuracy.

Critical digital infrastructure
National Health and Hospital Plan 2020–2023
In a digitalised health service, these digitalisation measures are important:
Digital infrastructure and security. The service providers are responsible for
the security of their systems, while the national authorities have the general
responsibility of ensuring that the infrastructure is robust and secure against
ICT attacks, with sufficient capacity and uptime.
National shared components. A range of state authorities are responsible for
developing and administering shared components; these include the Norwegian National Registry, ID-porten and Norwegian Patient Registry.
National standards and guidelines. The Norwegian Directorate of eHealth has
the main responsibility for coordinating the establishment of frameworks for
these.
National e-health solutions. The Norwegian Directorate of eHealth prepares
strategies and plans for developing these solutions, including helsenorge.
no and summary care records (‘kjernejournal’). Norsk Helsenett SF has been
charged with administration, operation and development, while the service providers are responsible for adopting the solutions.
Patient record systems. Those responsible for providing the services are also
responsible for procuring and operating the systems within the framework
established by the authorities.
Digital medical equipment. Those responsible for providing the health care services are also responsible for procuring and operating the equipments within
the framework established by the authorities.
Helseplattformen shows what is required to digitalise a service.
Digitalisation is triggered by technology, but mostly involves organisational development and changes in work processes. Experiences from Helseplattformen in Central
Norway illustrate this. The aim of the Helseplattformen project is to introduce new,
common patient records in hospitals and municipalities throughout Central Norway.
Helseplattformen also aims to improve quality in patient treatment, improve patient
security, provide more user-friendly systems and thereby enable health care personnel to perform their tasks better and more efficiently. As well as introducing the
technology itself, much of the work concerns improving data quality, standardising
health-related content and work processes and developing a management structure.
A team of 200 expert specialists from across the health service in Central Norway is
participating in project groups which decide specifically how work processes and the
content of Helseplattformen are to be standardised. This means establishing best
clinical practice. This is the first time that teams of healthcare personnel across the
service have sat down together and agreed on specific health-related standards on
this scale.

Elisabeth Strandberg works in the Haematology Department in Oslo University
Hospital. She is a nurse, professional
development nurse and has qualified in
advanced clinical nursing. “I have always
worked with patients who have blood
disorders, and I think that the field is
demanding but rewarding. Challenging
days mean that we need to work well in
teams in the department, enjoy working
there, are open and have a good working
partnership”, said Elisabeth. She works
in a highly specialised department. However, she chose to study a general course.
“In advanced treatment, it is important to
see the whole patient. That is why it is so
important to have good general nursing
skills, and it is what makes work on the
ward so rewarding”.
National Health and Hospital Plan 2020–2023
New tasks for health workers
“When I started as a health worker, more than 30
years ago, my tasks mainly involved care and nursing
of patients. Now, and particularly since we moved into
the new hospital here at Kalnes, my working day is very
different”, says Thorleif Johan Brønn of Østfold Hospital Trust. “For example, we take blood samples, perform NEWS scores, which is a system to detect deterioration in a patient’s condition at an early stage, change
dressings, help people with equipment and contact
municipalities when patients are discharged – and we
still provide care and nursing for patients”. Thorleif
emphasises how important it is for health workers
to spend plenty of time with patients, because their
observations are vital in determining what treatment is
provided by the rest of the patient’s team.
Thorleif believes that professional development is essential - for the team treating
the patient, for the patients and not least for the health workers themselves. There
are good learning opportunities in the workplace, and further education options are
tailored around the needs of the health and care services. “We need to make use of
the opportunities for lifelong learning and improving our skills”, Thorleif believes.

A culture for continuous improvement work has been established locally.
Changes are implemented more quickly than in the past, and knowledge
about what works is more quickly disseminated between departments and
hospitals. Hospitals work more systematically at phasing in and out methods,
based on the principles of prioritisation and updated knowledge. Choosing
wisely is established as the general approach among clinicians. Knowledge
about unwarranted variation, partly through health atlases, are actively used

undesirable incidents. Undesirable patient incidents are reported internally, and followed up
with a view to learning and prevention. The risk
of patient injuries is assessed when planning and
implementing measures.
Reduce unwarranted variation
Unwarranted variation
There is considerable variation within many fields in the health service. Variation is
unwarranted when it cannot be explained by differences in demographics, geography, morbidity or other factors outside the hospital’s control. The degree to which
the observed variation can be regarded as unwarranted may vary between types of
treatments. Random variation will be higher for uncommon treatments. A slightly
greater variation may be justified for treatments where there are geographical differences in the population’s morbidity. The figure below illustrates variation in the
number of shoulder operations performed in selected health trusts and the country
as a whole. Variation has increased, and this specific health service appears not to
be equally distributed through the population.

Improvement project at orthopaedic outpatient clinic, Telemark Hospital Trust
Increasing numbers of patients on the waiting list and a rise in the number of cancelled appointments was making work stressful for the staff at the Telemark Hospital Trust’s orthopaedic outpatient clinic. This stress could be a potential risk to
patient safety, and new measures had to be taken to reverse the trend. More than
measures were developed, tested, evaluated and adjusted. The best and most
effective of these measures were then introduced in the outpatient clinic. A shared
staffing plan was introduced for all occupational groups in order to avoid duplication of work, it was clarified which occupational groups could/should perform which
types of treatment, and how much time should be allocated to each treatment. The
measures have yielded a number of good results, including:
National Health and Hospital Plan 2020–2023
The number of cancelled appointments has been reduced significantly. This has
also led to a reduction in the number of telephone enquiries from patients.
The capacity of foundation doctors (FY–1) is better utilised. They are improving
their skills, with the result that the hospital is meeting its education and training goals. This also frees up time for experienced doctors to look at the more
advanced diagnoses.
Many unnecessary tasks for secretaries have been eliminated, which means
that they can spend more time on activities that create value for patients and
staff.
As a result of the project, there is a better understanding of how the hospital
can work on continuous improvement in its daily operations, to ensure that the
good results are maintained and improved even further.
Pharmacists’ skills are improving patient safety
Clinical pharmacists in the hospitals have skills which help to improve patient treatment and reduce costs. Clinical pharmacy has been introduced at many hospitals
in order to ensure that the right medications are used. They provide advice and
guidance to doctors, nurses and managers on the rational use of medication, and
on the correct combination of medication and medical equipment. The pharmacists
also participate in patient treatment. Western Norway Regional Health Authority
and other regions have pharmacists in several accident and emergency units who
attend to medication reconciliation on arrival. The Northern Norway Regional Health
Authority has clinical pharmacists in its intensive care departments who evaluate
antibiotic dosages at the start of treatments for sepsis patients. The correct dosage is crucial in terms of treatment outcome and length of hospital stay for these
patients. The Central Norway Regional Health Authority has introduced ‘antibiotic
pharmacists’ on wards in order to reduce antibiotic use in hospitals. The Southern
and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority has implemented projects which
show that the contribution by clinical pharmacists affects survival in patients with
multiple illnesses, and length of time between admissions.

What we have done in recent years
Moved services into patients’ homes through the use of technology: From 2019, all
video consultations are funded in the same way as consultations in person. Telephone
consultations in the field of somatics will be included in the scheme from 2020.
More efficient use of human resources in hospitals: More types of healthcare personnel, not just doctors, can initiate reimbursements to hospitals. Types of healthcare personnel have been added gradually over several years. Additional new personnel groups will be included in the scheme from 2020.
More ambulant and team-based treatment: Hospitals receive additional reimbursement when healthcare personnel provide treatment outside the walls of the hospital.
Ambulant outreach treatment teams in outpatient mental health care and multidisciplinary specialist substance abuse treatment are included in activity-based financing.
Cooperation between service levels: Work has been done to ensure that municipalities can provide certain defined specialist health services on behalf of hospitals,
when the services provided are regulated by agreements between the service levels. These activities will then be covered by activity-based financing. In the fields
of outpatient mental health care and multidisciplinary specialist substance abuse
treatment cooperation meetings between the specialist and primary health services
are included in the scheme.
Shift of activity from residential to outpatient treatment: In recent years, there have
been many changes to activity-based financing in order to encourage more day
surgery in the health service and make effective clarifications regarding emergency
assistance.

The figure shows how financing individual contacts in a service pathway differs from
financing an entire service pathway. Fitting a hip prosthesis involves assessment,
treatment and follow-up, which together constitute a service pathway in the specialist health service. The figure shows three variations in how this pathway can be
structured. The content of the three pathways varies in terms of specific activities,
meaning that the revenues of a hospital using the current activity-based financing
scheme will vary according to which of the three pathways is used. Alternatively,
financing can be linked to the entire hip prosthesis pathway.

National Strategy for
Artificial Intelligence
Strategy
Foreword
It is difficult to predict the future, but we know that Norway will be
affected by the age wave, climate change and increasing globalisation, and that in the coming years we must work smarter and
more efficiently to remain competitive and maintain the same level
of welfare. Digitalisation and new technologies are the key to
achieving this, and artificial intelligence will be a vital component.
Artificial intelligence represents vast opportunities for us as individuals, for business and
industry, and for the public sector. If used in the right way, technology can contribute to
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals – not just in Norway, but globally.
There are many good examples of AI in use in Norway, and in the coming years we will
likely see many more, especially in business and industry and the public sector. While the
United States and China have come far with consumer-oriented applications, our strength
lies in the fact that our industry, business and public sector are more technologically
advanced and digitalised than in most other countries. Norway is world-leading in the
process industry, green shipping, aquaculture and petroleum activities. We have one of the
most digitalised public sectors in the world. We must continue to build on these
advantages in our development and use of artificial intelligence.
Norwegian society is characterised by trust and respect for fundamental values such as
human rights and privacy. This is something we perhaps take for granted in Norway, but
leading the way in developing human-friendly and trustworthy artificial intelligence may
prove a key advantage in today's global competition.
There is no denying the fact that AI also presents some difficult questions. Who is
responsible for the consequences of a decision that is made by AI? What happens when
autonomous systems make decisions which we disagree with and which, in a worst-case
scenario, cause harm? And how do we make sure that the technology does not intentionally or unintentionally perpetuate and reinforce discrimination and prejudice? When
faced with dilemmas like these, it can be useful to have some fundamental principles to
turn to for guidance: transparency, explainability and cautious testing. These principles
must also be applied when we develop and use solutions built on artificial intelligence.
While working on this strategy I have had opportunities to meet people who work on
artificial intelligence in academia, business and industry, and the public sector. I have had
meetings with employer and employee organisations who see that artificial intelligence will
impact the labour market in the time ahead. An overview of most of these meetings is
available at www.regjeringen.no/ki-strategi, along with all the written input I received. I
would like to thank everyone who shared their engagement and insights.
I hope this strategy can serve as a framework for both public and private entities seeking to
develop and use artificial intelligence. Together we will explore the potential that lies in this
exciting technology!

completely new ways. The Government wants Norway to take the lead in
developing and using AI that respects individuals' rights and freedoms.
Introduction and summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) represents vast opportunities for us as individuals and for
society at large. AI can lead to new, more effective business models and to effective,
user-centric services in the public sector.
Norway is well positioned for succeeding with artificial intelligence. We have:
a high level of public trust in both the business and public sectors
a population and business sector that are digitally competent
An excellent infrastructure and high-quality registry data that span over
many decades
well developed e-governance and public agencies that have come a long
way with digitalisation and that have the capacity and expertise to
experiment with new technologies
tripartite cooperation between employers, unions and government, which
facilitates cooperation when restructuring is necessary
Technology will not only enable us to perform tasks in increasingly better ways; it will
also enable us to perform them in completely new ways. But development and use of
AI can also present challenges.
Norwegian society is characterised by trust and respect for fundamental values such
as human rights and privacy. The Government wants Norway to lead the way in
developing and using AI with respect for individual rights and freedoms. This can
become a key advantage in today's global competition.
The Government believes that:
artificial intelligence that is developed and used in Norway should be built
on ethical principles and respect human rights and democracy
research, development and use of artificial intelligence in Norway should
promote responsible and trustworthy AI
development and use of AI in Norway should safeguard the integrity and
privacy of the individual
cyber security should be built into the development, operation and
administration of systems that use AI
supervisory authorities should oversee that AI systems in their areas of
supervision are operated in accordance with the principles for responsible
and trustworthy use of AI
A good basis for artificial intelligence
The Government will facilitate world-class AI infrastructure in Norway in the form of
digitalisation-friendly regulations, good language resources, fast and robust
communication networks, and sufficient computing power. It will facilitate data sharing
within and across industries and sectors.
Data
Data is vital for the development and use of AI. Today vast amounts of information are
generated from many different sources. AI and machine learning can use this data to
give us important insights.
Access to high-quality datasets is essential for exploiting the potential of AI. The
Government will facilitate data sharing in both the public and private sectors and
between sectors.
Regulations
The Government will evaluate whether there are regulations that hamper appropriate
and desired use of artificial intelligence in the public and private sectors. There will be
requirements for transparency and accountability in new systems for public
administration in which AI is used. The Government is positive towards establishing
regulatory sandboxes in areas where this is called for. Such initiatives already exist in
connection with autonomous transport. The Government will also establish an
advisory body and a regulatory sandbox for AI in the area of data protection.
Language
Language technologies such as speech recognition and language comprehension
represent an important component of AI. To enable Norwegian citizens to participate
in increasingly advanced services in their own language, we need good language
resources in both Norwegian language forms and in Sami. The Government will
facilitate the collection of and access to language resources.
Communication networks and computing power
Development and use of AI requires a sound communication infrastructure and access
to computing power. The work on communication infrastructure, and on 5G networks
in particular, is a priority area for the Government. Access to sufficient computing
power will be secured through the use of national and international resources for highperformance computing.
Developing and leveraging artificial intelligence
Norway will invest in AI in areas where we have distinct advantages, such as health,
seas and oceans, public administration, energy and mobility.
The Government wants Norwegian organisations to be attractive cooperation partners
for leading business and research communities in AI. Norway will continue to pursue
its investment in basic and applied ICT research. Policy instruments that stimulate
investment in strong research communities, such as the Research Council of Norway's
centre schemes, will be central to AI investments.
Artificial intelligence will have a dominant place in Horizon Europe, the EU's next
framework programme for research and innovation. Moreover, the EU has proposed
the establishment of a comprehensive digitalisation programme, Digital Europe
Programme (DEP), for the period 2021–2027. The programme will focus on initiatives in
high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. The Government has signed a
non-binding declaration of intent to participate in Horizon Europe and will consider
Norway's participation in DEP from 2021.
Norway will have advanced skills, including in basic ICT research and AI research, in
order to understand and benefit from changes in technological developments. This
requires good study programmes that coincide with the needs of different sectors for
advanced skills in artificial intelligence and in basic subjects such as statistics,
mathematics and information technology.
AI and related topics such as ethics and data protection associated with applications of
AI will also be important in areas such as law and other professional programmes.
Institutions of higher education ought to evaluate how topics with relevance to artificial
intelligence can be integrated into their programmes in areas that will be affected by
artificial intelligence in the coming years.
Technological development will lead to changes in the labour market, and the pace of
change is likely to accelerate. Opportunities for upskilling and reskilling – both in the
workplace and in the form of study programmes – will therefore be increasingly
important as applications of AI become more widespread in the labour market. The
Government will present a white paper on a skills reform, and has already begun work
on flexible further educational programmes both for digital skills and for employees
who must adapt their skills as a result of digitalisation and the transition to a green
society.
Enhancing innovation capacity using artificial intelligence
The Government wants Norway to exploit the innovative potential of artificial
intelligence. Norway can take a leading position in applying artificial intelligence,
particularly in areas where we already are well positioned and have strong research
and business communities, such as health, oil and gas, energy, the maritime and
marine industries and the public sector.
The Government will consider how industrial policy instruments can best be designed
to support the potential value creation and use of AI in the business sector.
Public agencies ought to actively explore the potential of artificial intelligence, and
increased interaction between the public sector and the business sector should
promote innovation and value creation. The public sector ought to actively explore
opportunities in the market in connection with procurements, and innovative public
procurements should be used where appropriate. To facilitate innovative solutions, the
agencies ought to focus on their needs rather than on concrete products or services.
Responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence
Development and use of AI can also present challenges, in particular for AI that builds
on personal data. There is therefore a need for continuous discussion about what is
responsible and desirable development and about what can be done to prevent
adverse development.
The Government wants Norway to lead the way in developing and using AI with
respect for individual rights and freedoms. In Norway, artificial intelligence will be
based on ethical principles, respect for privacy and data protection and good cyber
security. Norway will continue to participate in European and international forums to
promote responsible and trustworthy use of AI.
About the strategy
The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence is intended for the civilian sector – both
private and public. It does not cover the defence sector. The strategy focuses on
specifying what is meant by artificial intelligence and on describing some areas where
it will be important for Norway to exploit the opportunities offered by AI.
Artificial intelligence is an area that is constantly evolving. For this reason, no specific
time period is applied to the strategy. There will be a need to adjust and evaluate the
strategy at appropriate intervals, in line with technological and social developments.
This strategy must also be viewed in connection with other important work by the
Government, such as the digitalisation strategy for the public sector1, a new public
administration act2, a review of the system of business-oriented policy instruments3,
the skills reform for lifelong learning (Lære hele livet), health data regulation4, and
several other small- and large-scale initiatives that are discussed in the strategy.

Doing nothing with AI, Emanuel Gollob (AT)

Artificial intelligence systems perform actions, physically or
digitally, based on interpreting and processing structured
or unstructured data, to achieve a given goal.
What is AI?
1 Definition
Definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) vary considerably, and often change in line with
what is technologically possible. This strategy takes the definition proposed by the
European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence5 as its
starting point, and defines AI as:
AI systems act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment,
processing and interpreting information and deciding the best action(s) to take to
achieve the given goal. Some AI systems can adapt their behaviour by analysing how the
environment is affected by their previous actions.
As a scientific discipline, artificial intelligence embraces various approaches and
technologies, such as machine learning (including, for example, deep learning and
reinforcement learning), machine reasoning (including planning, search and
optimisation), and certain methodologies in robotics (such as control, sensors, and
integration with other technologies in cyber physical systems).

definition of AI: Main capabilities and scientific disciplines

Commission (2019): A definition of AI: Main capabilities and disciplines.
'Strong' and 'weak' artificial intelligence
We are still a long way from a form of artificial intelligence that resembles human
intelligence, or artificial general intelligence (AGI). Artificial general intelligence is often
referred to as 'strong AI' while other forms are referred to as 'weak AI' or 'narrow AI'.
This does not mean that AI systems that are designed for a specific 'narrow' area
cannot be powerful or effective, but they more often refer to specific systems designed
to perform a single task, such as image processing or pattern recognition, for specific
purposes. Nor is it the case that AI developed in parallel in many specific areas, or
research on 'weak AI', necessarily brings us closer to artificial general intelligence.
Our definition embraces both 'strong' and 'weak' artificial intelligence.
Rule-based systems for automation
A rule-based IT system is often built on rules such as 'IF x happens, THEN do Y'. Such
rules can be organised in complex decision trees. Rule-based automation systems can
be used to model regulations, business logic or experience-based practice (exercise of
discretion). Many of the systems used for automated administrative processing in the
public sector are rule-based. Our definition of artificial intelligence covers some of
these systems, depending on factors such as the complexity of the rule set.
2 How does artificial intelligence work?
A system based on artificial intelligence can either interpret data from devices such as
sensors, cameras, microphones or pressure gauges or can be fed input data from
other information sources. The system analyses the data, makes decisions and
performs actions. Both the need for data and the fact that it is the system that makes
decisions and performs actions raise ethical issues that are discussed in chapter 5.
Some types of systems have a feedback loop which enables the artificial intelligence to
learn either from its own experiences or from direct feedback from users or operators.
The artificial intelligence system is usually embedded as a component within a larger
system. Tasks are often performed digitally, as part of an IT system, but AI systems can
also be part of a physical solution, such as a robot.
Examples of current practical applications of AI are:
Computer vision/identification of objects in images: can be used for
purposes such as facial recognition or for identifying cancerous tumours.
Pattern recognition or anomaly detection: can be used to, for example,
expose bank or insurance fraud or to detect data security breaches.
Natural language processing (NLP): can be used to sort and categorise
documents and information, and to extract relevant elements from vast
datasets.
Robotics: can be used to develop autonomous vehicles such as cars, ships
and drones.
Development in some areas has progressed rapidly, and we are already seeing
systems being used in practice. Development and testing in other areas can take
longer to achieve reliable and verified results.
Machine learning
Today when we hear about systems being based on artificial intelligence, they are
usually based on machine learning. Unlike rule-based systems, where rules are defined
by humans and are often based on expert experience, business logic or regulations,
the concept of machine learning covers a range of different technologies where the
rules are deduced from the data on which the system is trained.
In AI systems developed by machine learning, the machine learning algorithms build
mathematical models based on example data or training data. These models are then
used to make decisions.
Machine learning algorithms usually learn in three different ways:
Supervised learning: the algorithm is trained with a dataset where both
input data and output data are given. In other words, the algorithm is fed
both the 'task' and the 'solution' and uses them to build the model. This
will make it capable of making a decision based on input data.
Non-supervised learning: the algorithm is fed only a dataset without a
'solution' and must find patterns in the dataset which then can be used to
make decisions about new input data. Deep learning algorithms can be
trained using non-supervised learning.
Reinforcement learning: the algorithm builds its model based on nonsupervised learning but receives feedback from the user or operator on
whether the decision it proposes is good or bad. The feedback is fed into
the system and contributes to improving the model.
Figure 2: The interrelationship between an AI system, its operator and environments.
Deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning. Today deep learning is an
important component in widely used solutions such as image processing, computer
vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Other areas of application
are: pharmaceutical development, recommendation systems (for music, films, etc.),
medical imaging processing, personalised medicine, and anomaly detection in a range
of areas. The most widely used deep learning frameworks have been developed by
Google (TensorFlow) and Facebook (PyTorch).
Some deep learning algorithms are like a 'black box', where one has no access to the
model that can explain why a given input value produces a given outcome. This is
discussed in more detail in chapter 5.

The Government will facilitate world-class AI infrastructure in Norway in
the form of digitalisation-friendly regulations, good language resources,
fast and robust communication networks, and sufficient computing power.
It will facilitate data sharing within and across industries and sectors.
A good basis for AI
1 Data and data management
Data is vital to AI. Today vast datasets are generated from many different sources. AI
and machine learning can use this data to provide important insights. Access to highquality datasets is decisive for exploiting the potential of AI. The Government's goal is
to facilitate sharing of data from the public sector so that business and industry,
academia and civil society can use the data in new ways.
Data can be regarded as a renewable resource. Sharing data with others does not
mean that one is left with less data. In fact, the value of data can increase when shared
because it can be combined with other types of data that can offer new insights or be
used by organisations with the expertise to use the data in new and innovative ways.
Open public data
In principle, all information that is lawfully published on public websites can also be
made accessible as open data. Personal data that is exempt from public disclosure or
that is subject to confidentiality must not, however, be made accessible unless specific
reasons apply for doing so. Weather data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute
and traffic information from the Norwegian Public Roads Administration are examples
of open data from the public sector.
Personal data
The issues related to sharing and using data are closely connected to the type of data
involved. It is important to distinguish between use of personal data and use of data
that cannot be traced back to specific individuals, such as weather data. Use of
personal data for developing AI raises a number of issues that must be addressed
before such data can be shared or used.
Data sharing principles
Principles for sharing open public data
Even though there is no statutory obligation that requires open public data to be made
accessible, the Government's goal is for such data to be shared so that it can be used
by others (what we refer to as 'reuse').
Report to the Storting no. 27 (2015–2016) Digital agenda for Norway: ICT for a simpler
everyday life and increased productivity highlighted five sectors where reuse of open
public data is regarded to be of particular economic value: culture, research and
education, government expenditure, transport and communications, and maps and
property (geodata). Specific strategies have been developed for data sharing in these
areas. Furthermore, the Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Management
(DFØ) has developed a system for publishing data pertaining to public expenditure.
The Freedom of Information Act regulates how public data should be made available
for reuse. Since 2012, the Digitalisation Circular has required government agencies
which establish new or upgrade existing IT-systems or digital services to make data
from these accessible in machine-readable formats. The agency should arrange for
data to be accessible in the long term, with integrity, authenticity, usability and
reliability intact.
The Nordic countries share many interests and values with respect to artificial
intelligence. The Nordic countries therefore cooperate through the Nordic Council of
Ministers in several areas related to AI. One of these areas concerns data. A working
group has been formed to identify datasets that can be exchanged between Nordic
countries and create added value for Nordic enterprises – public and private alike –
while still respecting the ethical aspects and the trust and values particular to the
Nordic countries.
One important measure in the digitalisation strategy for the public sector6 is to
establish a national resource centre for data sharing in the Norwegian Digitalisation
Agency. The centre is intended to serve as a knowledge hub, and one of its tasks will be
to increase awareness about the value of sharing data.
Principles for data sharing between public-sector agencies
The Government has established a 'once only' principle to ensure that citizens and
businesses do not have to provide identical information to multiple public bodies.7
Updated and quality-assured information that is shared across public administrations
is a prerequisite for implementing the once-only principle, and is important for
developing better, more coherent public services.
Some information is held in central registries, such as the National Population Register
and the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, but a lot of information exists
outside such registries. To facilitate sharing of this data between public agencies, the
Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation (2019): One digital public sector. Digital strategy
for the public sector 2019–2025
Report to the Storting no. 27 (2015–2016) Digital agenda for Norway: ICT for a simpler everyday life
and increased productivity
Brønnøysund Register Centre and the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency have
established the National Data Directory to provide an overview of the types of data
held by various public agencies, how they are related, and what they mean. This
catalogue will also provide information on whether data may be shared and on what
terms.
The Digitalisation Circular requires agencies to publish data that can be shared with
others in the National Data Directory and on data.norge.no.
Principles for publicly funded research data
Research that is publicly funded should benefit everyone. It is therefore important that
research data be made accessible to as many as possible; to other researchers as well
as to public administration and the business sector. Better access to research data can
boost innovation and value creation by enabling actors outside research communities
to find new areas of application. It can also contribute to smarter service development
in the public sector, opportunities for new business activities, and new jobs.
There is no doubt that far more datasets from research can be made accessible, along
with pertinent protocols, methods, models, software and source codes. Such access
must be safeguarded by sound data protection practices and give due consideration to
security, intellectual property rights and business secrets. However, the vast and
growing amount of research data means that not all data can be archived and
maintained for the same long periods. The costs of making datasets genuinely
reusable must be weighed against the benefit to research communities and society.
The Government has presented a strategy on access to and sharing of research data. 8
The strategy sets out three basic principles for publicly funded research data in
Norway:
Research data must be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary.
Research data should be managed and curated to take full advantage of
its potential value.
Decisions concerning the archiving and curation of research data must be
made within the research community.
Framework for data sharing in the industry sector
In Germany, a framework for sharing data in the industry sector, International
Data Spaces, was established in connection with the Industry 4.0 initiative. The
initiative has been expanded to industry sectors in other countries, and in Norway
SINTEF has enabled Norwegian companies to use the framework. The framework
offers a common infrastructure for the secure storage of industry data. The
framework offers companies control of their own data while enabling them to
share it if they wish to do so.
Sources: Fraunhofer institut, SINTEF
Ministry of Education and Research (2012): National strategy on access to and sharing of research
data
Principles for data sharing in the business sector
In principle, companies own their own data, and it is up to each company to decide
how it wants to use its data within the parameters of data protection regulations. Few
industries and businesses are aware of the value of data sharing. Many companies
have a poor overview of their own data, and therefore have neither categorised it nor
assessed its potential benefit to themselves or to other organisations. 9
Norway has some examples of voluntary data sharing within the private sector and
between businesses and the public sector:

The oil and gas industry: In 1995 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and
the oil companies operating in the Norwegian continental shelf
established the Diskos National Data Repository (Diskos). Diskos is a
national data repository of information related to exploration and
extraction from the Norwegian shelf. The data is directly accessible online
to members of the Diskos joint venture. The idea behind Diskos is that the
oil companies should all cooperate on storing exploration data and
compete in interpreting it. 10
Geodata: Norway Digital is a broad cooperation programme between
agencies that are responsible for obtaining geospatial information and/or
that are large users of such information. The cooperation partners
comprise municipalities, counties, national agencies and private
enterprises such as telecom and power companies.11 Geonorge.no is a
national website that has been created for weather data and other
geospatial information in Norway under the Norway Digital partnership.
The authorities are generally hesitant about requiring private enterprises to share data.
The Government's position is that private enterprises with a mutual interest in sharing
data should do so on their own initiative. Nonetheless, this can prove difficult to
achieve in practice.
The Government has set out the following principles for sharing data from the
business sector:12
Voluntary data sharing is preferable, particularly between parties with a
mutual interest in sharing data.
The authorities can facilitate the sharing of data where the enterprises
themselves don't see the value in sharing if sharing such data would
enhance public benefit.
Data sharing may be imposed if necessary; for example for reasons of
public interest.
Data must be shared in such a way that individuals and businesses retain
control of their own data. Privacy and business interests must be
safeguarded.

The principles are inspired by: Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (2019): Dutch
vision on data sharing between businesses
Some activities in the business sector are performed for the public sector or under
permits or licences granted by public authorities. Public agencies have taken little
advantage of opportunities to set requirements for data access or sharing in
connection with entering into contracts or awarding licences. The Government will
therefore consider whether the public sector can contribute to making more datasets
from the business sector accessible by setting requirements for data sharing in
conjunction with entering into public contracts wherever appropriate. The Government
will also consider evaluating requirements to make data publicly accessible in licensing
areas where such access is considered to be of particular benefit to society.
Methods of sharing data
A variety of methods are available that can make it simpler and safer to share data
between different stakeholders:
Data lakes
A data lake is a central repository for storing data, such as a cloud service. The data can
be stored as is, in its original format, and can be a combination of structured and
unstructured data. The data need not be structured or labelled. The data lake can then
be used to retrieve data for machine learning or for other analyses.
Data trusts
A data trust is a legal structure where a trusted third party is responsible for the data
to be shared. The third party decides which data should be shared with whom, in
compliance with the purpose for which the data trust was set up.
Anonymisation interface
An anonymisation interface allows various analyses to be carried out on register data
containing personal data from multiple data sources without being able to identify
individuals. The Remote Access Infrastructure for Register Data (RAIRD) is a
cooperation project between the Norwegian Social Science Data Services and Statistics
Norway on such an anonymisation interface. The information model for RAIRD is
openly accessible and can be used by anyone.13
Synthetic data
Synthetic data can in many cases be an alternative to identifiable data or anonymised
data. If synthetic datasets can be produced with the same features as the original
dataset, they can be used to train algorithms or be used as test data. This means that
even datasets which normally would be considered sensitive could be made openly
accessible for use in research and innovation.
Common open application programming interfaces
An application programming interface (API) makes it possible to search directly in a
data source to retrieve the desired data. This is a prerequisite for being able to use
data in real time. The Digitalisation Circular establishes that public agencies must make
appropriate information available in machine-readable and preferably standardised
formats, ideally using APIs.

Generation of synthetic test data for the National Registry
The Norwegian Tax Administration is in the process of developing a solution in
which machine learning is used to generate rich synthetic test data in a dedicated
test environment for the National Registry. The synthetic National Registry will
offer synthetic test subjects in addition to simulating events. The objective is to
allow enterprises that use information from the National Registry to test their
integrations without using authentic personal data in the tests. Initially the
synthetic National Registry will be made available to parties needing to test
integration with the National Registry. Eventually it will be available to everyone
who needs National Registry data for testing purposes.

White paper on the data-driven economy
The Government will prepare a white paper on data sharing and the data-driven
economy. The white paper will discuss important issues such as data ownership,
incentives for sharing data, and possibilities for equitable sharing of the economic
gains from a global digital data economy. Other important issues are data protection,
secure data sharing, and ethical use of data. The white paper will also discuss issues
relating to competence in data science and data sharing, and to infrastructure for data
capture and sharing.
As part of the work on preparing the white paper, the Minister of Digitalisation will
appoint an expert group to examine the prerequisites and terms for sharing data
within and from the business sector.
The Government will
present a white paper on the data-driven economy and innovation
establish a resource centre for data sharing, with expertise in the relation ship
between law, technology, business and administrative processes
establish a set of principles for extracting and managing data from central
registries, and a common API catalogue to promote better utilisation of basic
data by providing an overview of data interfaces (APIs)
consider policy instruments that can make it easier for industry sectors to
share data and that simultaneously safeguard privacy and data protection,
security, and business interests
give guidance to public agencies on how they can ensure access to data when
entering into contracts by, for example, proposing standard clauses
consider which areas it may be in the public interest to require that data from
the business sector be made accessible, and examine whether requirements
for data access in connection with licences might be a suitable policy
instrument in this regard
2.2 Language data and language resources
Language technology in the form of, for example, speech recognition and language
comprehension, represents a key component in AI. Natural language processing (NLP)
involves registering natural language (text/audio) and understanding the meaning and
context. Natural language generation (NLG) involves producing text based on data.
These technologies combined are important in the development of virtual assistants
and in analyses based on unstructured data.
To make systems like these accessible in written Norwegian and Sami and in dialects,
the technology must be adapted to these languages and to local conditions. This
requires language resources.
Språkbanken, a service provided by the National Library of Norway, makes language
data available for developing language technology in Norwegian. The National Library
of Norway and the Language Council of Norway will cooperate by coordinating their
efforts to further develop the resources held in Språkbanken. They also have a
responsibility to make sure that the public sector as buyer, and developer
communities in both the public and private sectors, be informed about and request
these language resources.
The Sami languages are particularly vulnerable. Language technology and language
technology resources in Sami are important for contributing to future development
and use of the language and eventually for developing services in Sami based on
artificial intelligence. Divvun and Giellatekno, the research group for Saami language
technology at the Arctic University of Norway, are both developing different language
technology tools for Sami. The Government will return to the issue of Sami language
data and language resources in a white paper on Sami language, culture and society.
The main topic of the white paper will be digitalisation.
One of the challenges in the work on facilitating language technology in Norwegian
and Sami is obtaining sufficient amounts of language data within different domains,
such as medicine, ICT and transport. There is a need for both written and oral data that
covers dialects and pronunciation variations. Examples of useful resources include
Analysis and classification of unstructured data in the MFA
Every year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) receives up to 6,000 reports from
Norwegian embassies, delegations, etc. Previously it was extremely difficult to
navigate all this information. Since the MFA adopted machine learning and NLP to
analyse and classify the content of these documents, it has been possible to find
almost all relevant information on a given subject matter. The solution is also
used to extract key information in reports and prepare summaries.
In the work on developing this solution, the MFA cooperated with the University of
Oslo, which provided solutions for categorising the Norwegian language. The plan
is to gradually expand the solution with information from archives and external
research reports.
Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs
multilingual terminology lists, area-specific texts and speech recordings or parallel
texts in different languages. The linguistic structures in text produced by the public
sector constitute valuable data for language technology research and development. It
is important to facilitate reuse for these purposes.
There is reason to believe that the public sector possesses far more data that could be
used in developing language technology than it realises. The Government will therefore promote awareness of language data and language resources in the public sector
by, among other things, addressing such data specifically in the Digitalisation Circular.
The Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation has strengthened the information management resource centre in the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency in order
to facilitate closer cooperation with the National Library and the Language Council of
Norway. The agencies will cooperate on strategies to ensure that public language
resources can be used for language technology purposes, guidance on what can be
regarded as language resources and on ensuring deposits of language resources for
Språkbanken.
Language technology aids
Tuva is an aid for dictating text (speech recognition) and navigating a PC using
voice control. The product was developed by Max Manus in 2017 and is provided
to people with permanent disabilities. The solution uses AI and builds on
resources from Språkbanken. The dataset developed specially for this system is
now openly accessible to other developers in Språkbanken.
eTranslation is a machine translation service developed by the EU that can be
used by the public sector in the EEA area. The functionality for Norwegian is built
on translations by the Unit for EEA Translation Services in the MFA, translations by
Semantix for public agencies and from standards translated by Standard Norway.
Språkbanken makes the datasets accessible to developers and researchers.

2.3 Regulations
Norway has a tradition for modernising its legal framework to meet new technological
developments, starting with the eRegulation project14 in 2000. The aim is to make laws
and regulations as technology-neutral as possible so that they can be applied even
when new technologies and digitalisation change our society and the way we live.
At the same time, we often see that regulation is called for when new technologies give
rise to problematic applications. We have seen examples of this with artificial
intelligence in connection with electoral manipulation in social media and 'deep fakes'.
However, it is challenging – and often inexpedient – to regulate a technology that is still
in an early phase. Regulating too early can have unintended consequences on
developments, disrupt the market and reduce the potential for innovation. Moreover,
any technology will often have both positive and negative applications. The same
underlying technology used to produce deep fakes can also be used to, for example,
create synthetic data, a technology that helps protect personal data.
Digitalisation-friendly regulations
The Government wants the legal framework to reflect the opportunities and challenges
that come with new technology, including artificial intelligence. It also wants
regulations to be digitalisation friendly. Regulations ought to facilitate fully and partly
automated administrative proceedings and not contain unnecessary discretionary
provisions.15 Regulations suitable for automated administrative proceedings ought to
be machine-readable so that they can be used AI-systems.
There is a need to consider whether there are areas where regulations impose
inexpedient and adverse limitations on the development and use of artificial
intelligence. Among other things, there is a need to review laws that apply to some
public agencies to see how the regulations can better facilitate sharing and using data
and developing and using artificial intelligence.
Such a process will require thoroughly reviewing sector-specific regulations and
drawing on cross-sectoral expertise so that consideration is given to society's needs,
the individual's right to privacy, and the technological possibilities. This work must be
viewed in connection with the regulatory review aimed at removing barriers to
digitalisation and innovation, as discussed in the Government's digital strategy for the
public sector.
Areas that create particular challenges:
Interoperability
The fact that different sector-specific regulations use the same concepts in different
ways can present challenges. Income, for example, does not mean the same in the
Norwegian Tax Administration as it does in the Norwegian Labour and Welfare
Administration (NAV), and the concept of co-habitant is defined in a variety of ways in

legislation to make it easier to be read by machines and used for artificial intelligence.
If concepts do not have the same meaning, it is important to have information on this
to prevent the system from producing misleading results.
Personal data: consent and statutory authority
Personal data is covered by the Personal Data Act. The principle of purpose limitation
means that the purpose for processing personal data must be clearly stated and
established when the data is collected. This is fundamental to ensuring that individuals
have control of their data and can give informed consent to data processing.
Development and use of artificial intelligence often require different types of personal
data; data which in some cases was originally collected for other purposes. Moreover,
processing of data – such as health data – may be subject to other regulations, such as
the Health Registries Act.
The most widespread way of gaining lawful access to personal data for use in AI is
consent. Consent is often obtained by the users' approving an end user agreement and
consenting to data processing when they want to use a service. The agreement should
state, among other things, how the entity will use the data collected and with whom it
may be shared. It must also be possible to withdraw consent, and some services allow
end users to administer how their personal data is used in more detail.
The public sector often collects and processes personal data without the explicit
consent of the user. In such cases, collection is based on a statutory provision that
provides legal basis to collect and use data on citizens for specific purposes. Norway
currently has no common system whereby citizens can see what information is
collected and administered by the public sector, though solutions have been
established in some important areas, such as helsenorge.no. Here users can
administer which healthcare personnel may access their summary care record and
clinical documents; withdraw their consent to be registered in certain health registries;
and grant power of attorney to family members.
Datasets that are based on consent will in most cases be incomplete or contain bias
that may influence the outcome of any analyses performed on the data. This is an
important reason for having central registries where registration is statutory and
mandatory.
When personal data is collected pursuant to a statutory provision, opportunities to use
the data for purposes other than the original purpose are limited unless the new use is
also permitted by a statutory provision. This means that public agencies have little
scope to use the data they collect to perform analyses on their own activities using AI
beyond the statutory authority provided for the relevant dataset. The Government
wants to expand the scope for public agencies to use their data to develop and use AI.
Regulatory challenges in the health area
There may be a need to develop regulatory frameworks in some health-related areas
before testing of methods based on AI takes place. Other areas are already
safeguarded under existing regulations. For example, algorithms used in medical
equipment software, such as surgical robots or software for enhancing or processing
images in diagnostic imaging instruments, are subject to regulation of medical
equipment. The Norwegian Medicines Agency provides guidance and supervises
compliance with regulations governing such equipment in the Norwegian market.
Development and use of tools based on artificial intelligence are dependent on
information from sources beyond the individual patients who receive health care in a
specific case. Use of data for patient treatment and use of patient data for research
purposes (secondary use) are currently regulated differently. The current regulations
provide no clear legal basis for using health data pertaining to one patient to provide
healthcare to the next patient unless the patient gives consent. However, exemption
from the duty of confidentiality may be granted to use patient data for research
purposes. Artificial intelligence challenges the distinction between research purposes
and patient treatment because there is often a need to include patient data from
research when AI-based tools developed in a research project are used to provide
treatment. Exemption from the duty of confidentiality will no longer apply in such
cases, and the use of personal data will no longer be legally permitted.
In July 2019 the Ministry of Health and Care Services distributed a proposal for
consultation regarding access to health data and other health-related data in health
registries.16 The proposal concerns access to health data for use in statistics, health
analyses, research, quality improvement, planning, management and emergency
preparedness in order to promote health, prevent disease and injury, and provide
better health and care services.
The Ministry of Health and Care Services is also considering amendments to
regulations governing access to health data in connection with teaching and quality
assurance. This work includes reviewing permission to use health data in decision
support tools. Moreover, the Norwegian Directorate of Health, the Directorate of
eHealth and the Norwegian Medicines Agency have, in consultation with the regional
health authorities, been tasked with identifying the opportunities and challenges
posed by artificial intelligence and what adaptations in regulatory conditions at
national level night be needed.
In the long term, more tasks which today are performed by healthcare personnel may
be performed by autonomous systems and artificial intelligence. Relevant examples
span from automatic generation of patient records, patient logistics and fleet
management of the ambulance service to autonomous surgical robots. Although the
scope of automation and autonomous tools will expand in the health sector, health
personnel will still be responsible for ensuring proper provision of healthcare.
Health analysis platform
The Government will establish a health analysis platform, a national system for
making health data accessible for research purposes and for other, secondary
uses. The platform will allow more advanced analysis of Norwegian health data
and will form the basis for new types of medical and health research. Among
other things, it will allow health data to be used more actively in developing
medicines and medical technology.

Regulatory sandboxes
Regulatory sandboxes are first and foremost a policy instrument for promoting
responsible innovation. A regulatory sandbox is intended to give enterprises
opportunities to test new technologies and/or business models within specific
parameters. In this strategy the concept is used to refer to:
legislative amendments that allow trials, for example subject to
application, usually within a limited geographical area or time period
more comprehensive measures in areas where close monitoring and
supervision is needed, usually by the relevant supervisory authority
The concept of regulatory sandboxes is best known in the financial sector, where
supervisory authorities in several countries have given enterprises opportunities to
test specific products, technologies or services on a limited number of customers for a
limited time period and under close monitoring. In December 2019 the Norwegian
financial supervisory authority (Finanstilsynet) established a regulatory sandbox for
financial technology (fintech). The purpose of the sandbox is to expand Finanstilsynet’s
understanding of new technological solutions in financial markets, while at the same
time expanding enterprises' understanding of regulatory requirements and how they
are applied to new business models, products and services.
However, it makes little sense to talk about one regulatory sandbox for AI. AI solutions
do not represent a homogeneous group of services, and are subject to a broad
spectrum of regulations and regulatory authorities, depending on their purpose and
functionality.
The Government has already established regulatory sandboxes in the area of
transportation, in the form of legislative amendments that allow testing activities. An
act has been introduced allowing pilot projects on autonomous vehicles. The act
entered into force on 1 January 2018.17 The Norwegian maritime authorities
established the first test bed for autonomous vessels as early as 2016. A further two
test beds have since been approved. 18 In 2019 the Storting adopted a new Harbours
and Fairways Act19 which, subject to application, permits autonomous coastal shipping.
Such permission allows sailing in specific fairways subject to compulsory pilotage or in
areas where no pilotage services are provided.
Where pilot projects depart from applicable laws and regulations, they can be
conducted with statutory authority in special laws, as in the examples mentioned, or in
the Pilot Schemes in Public Administration Act. Under the Pilot Schemes, public
administration can apply to the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation to
depart from laws and regulations in order to test new ways of organising their
activities or performing their tasks for a period of up to four years. In the white paper
on innovation in the public sector we will consider whether the Pilot Schemes allows
sufficient scope to test new solutions based on AI.

Investment in autonomous ships
The Norwegian shipping industry is at the forefront of developing and exploiting
new technologies. Norway will have the world's first commercially operated
autonomous ship: Yara Birkeland. On commission from Yara, the Kongsberg
Group is supplying equipment for the world's first electric, zero-emissions,
autonomous container ship. The ship will transport fertiliser from Yara's factory
on Herøya to the ports of Brevik and Larvik. The ship, which is due to be delivered
in 2020, will gradually move from manned operation to fully autonomous
operation with remote monitoring in 2022. The ship will replace a substantial
volume of road haulage (estimated at 40,000 truck journeys annually), emit fewer
greenhouse gas emissions, improve local air quality and produce less noise.
In addition, NorgesGruppen (ASKO) has received funds from ENOVA (NOK 119
million) to establish an autonomous transport chain across the Oslo fjord,
between Moss and Holmestrand. Two sea drones will then replace 150 daily
(approximately 50,000 annual) truck journeys between Østfold and Vestfold.
These all-electric, autonomous transport ferries are scheduled for commission in

The Government will establish a regulatory sandbox for data protection under the
remit of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority. This will fulfil several purposes:
Enterprises can gain a better understanding of the regulatory
requirements placed on data protection and reduce the time from
development and testing to actually rolling out AI solutions to the market.
Systems that are rolled out after being developed in the sandbox can
serve as leading examples, and can help other enterprises that are
interested in developing similar systems.
The authorities can gain a better understanding of new technological
solutions and more easily identify potential risks and problems at an early
stage so that guidance material can be produced to clarify how the
regulations should be applied.
The authorities and industries can identify sectors with a need for their
own industry standards.
Individuals and society as a whole will benefit from new and innovative
solutions being developed within responsible parameters.
The Government is positive towards developing new regulatory sandboxes in different
areas. Responsibility for such regulatory sandboxes ought to lie with the communities
best qualified to test new systems. In some areas, such as further development of
smart cities and autonomous transport systems, it may be natural for this responsibility to lie with local and regional authorities or other enterprises communities.
The Information Commissioner's Office's regulatory sandbox
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK is testing a regulatory
sandbox designed to support development of products and services that are
innovative and widely beneficial. Organisations can have the way they use
personal data in their systems reviewed and assessed. ICO can provide some
comfort from enforcement action during the testing and development phases of
their systems. ICO wants to work on products and services that are at the cutting
edge of development and that operate in areas where there is genuine
uncertainty about how regulations should be interpreted.
Following an open application process, the ICO selected 10 organisations of
varying types and sizes and from different sectors to be provided with free,
professional guidance from ICO staff. One of the successful applicants is
Heathrow Airport's project to assess whether facial recognition technology can be
used for checking in, security checks, self-service bag drops, etc. to create a
frictionless journey through the airport. Another project selected comes from
TrustElevate, which is developing a model using AI for age-checking children and
young people under 16 in connection with accessing social media.

Public Administration Act and Archival Act
The reports published by the Law Commission on the Archival Act20 and by the Law
Commission on the Public Administration Act21 will both have a bearing on publicsector administrative proceedings and on the use of AI in public administration.
Administrative proceedings in the public sector are highly regulated, though some
degree of discretionary assessment may be exercised in the process. This means that a
system does not have to be either manual or automated. It can have solutions where
only exceptional cases are processed manually or have processes where an executive
officer must examine certain points in order to make an assessment, but where the
rest of the process is automated and rule-based. Many public-sector administrative
proceedings are already automated. There are case management systems with
integrated application dialogue making it possible to make automated decisions
immediately.
A feature common to all of the current automated case management systems is that
they are rule-based. The regulations are programmed into the solution, making it
possible to give reasons for the decisions made. The Public Administration Act requires
grounds to be given for all decisions affecting individuals. This obligation to state
grounds is important for safeguarding citizens' opportunities to verify and check
decisions made concerning them.
NOU 2019: 9 Fra kalveskinn til datasjø – Ny lov om samfunnsdokumentasjon og arkiver [Official
Norwegian Report on a new Archival Act]
NOU 2019: 5 Ny forvaltningslov – Lov om saksbehandlingen i offentlig forvaltning (forvaltningsloven).
[Official Norwegian Report on a new Public Administration Act]
NOU 2019: 5 Ny forvaltningslov [New Public Administration Administration Act]
The Law Commission on the Public Administration Act was appointed in 2015 and
submitted its report in the spring of 2019. A central element in the commission's
mandate was 'to draft an act that facilitates and builds on the fact that most
administrative proceedings are performed, or will be performed, digitally'.
The commission points out that automated decision-making can generate
substantial efficiency gains, particularly where case volumes are large. Automation can also promote equal treatment, given that everyone who is in the same
situation, according to the system criteria, is automatically treated equally.
Automation enables consistent implementation of regulations and can prevent
unequal practice. Automated administrative proceedings can also enhance
implementation of rights and obligations; for example, by automatically making
decisions that grant benefits when the conditions are met. This can particularly
benefit the most disadvantaged in society. More consistent implementation of
obligations can lead to higher levels of compliance and to a perception among
citizens that most people contribute their share, which in turn can help build trust.
Wherever there is a need to exercise discretion, rule-based systems can filter out
cases or checkpoints for manual assessment. The commission points out that
machine learning can offer new possibilities for automating assessment criteria.
The majority of the commission proposes that statutory authority be provided in
the regulations to allow administrative bodies in specific areas to make decisions
using fully automated administrative proceedings. Decisions with a low impact on
individuals may be made without providing statutory authority in regulations. The
commission also proposes that the administrative body must document the legal
content of automated decision-making systems. Such information should be
made public unless laws, regulations or special considerations dictate otherwise.
The Law Commission on the Public Administration Act sees the difficulty in
implementing cohesive services without sharing data across agencies. The
absence of authority to share information can make it difficult to organise the
public administration appropriately, and prevent full automation of administrative
proceedings in areas that lend themselves to this. The commission therefore
proposes that authority be given to share confidential information with other
administrative bodies on a need-to-know basis. This constitutes a broader
application than current laws.
Source: NOU 2019: 5 Ny forvaltningslov - Lov om saksbehandlingen i offentlig forvaltning
(forvaltningsloven)
There is huge potential to increase the use of artificial intelligence in public-sector
administrative proceedings in the form of both rule-based systems and machine
learning. The Law Commission on the Public Administration Act emphasizes that
automation can promote equal treatment and consistent implementation of
regulations. Nonetheless, when case management systems containing AI elements are
implemented, the algorithm's judgement must be at least as sound and as trustworthy
as the human discretion it replaces. To ensure this, we need systems that are
transparent and explainable.
In its report, the Law Commission on the Archival Act points to the importance of
ensuring that AI-driven processes and decisions are documented and that the
documentation is protected in ways that render it authentic and usable. Existing
archiving procedures, archiving systems and archiving institutions in the public sector
are currently not equipped to address this challenge. The commission therefore
recommends that consideration be given to how archiving functionality can be built
into the administrative processes and to identify any specific aspects resulting from
the use of artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence can also be used to achieve better, more efficient classification
and sorting of information and thereby simplify and improve record-keeping and
archiving practices in the future.
The Government will
review and assess regulations that hamper appropriate and desired use of
artificial intelligence in the public and private sectors
set requirements for transparency and accountability in new public
administration systems in which AI is part of the solution
establish an advisory body and a regulatory sandbox in the area of privacy and
data protection
be receptive to requests from public and private enterprises to establish more
regulatory sandboxes
establish a health analysis platform to streamline and simplify access to health
data for research and analysis and simultaneously strengthen privacy and data
protection

facilitate more active use of health data for testing the effects and safety of
medicines and medical technology
2.4 Infrastructure: networks and computing power
Deployment of the electronic communication networks
The electronic communication networks, and the mobile communication networks in
particular, are a cornerstone in the digital transformation of society. Norway has a
well-developed fourth-generation (4G) mobile network with excellent coverage. There
are plans to deploy a nationwide 5G network in the Norwegian mobile market by
22 This will be important for leveraging the opportunities that lie in 5G technology
and 5G networks, not least as an underlying technology for the Internet of Things (IoT).
IoT is a term often used to refer to the ever increasing amount of sensors connected to
the internet. It can cover everything from mobile phones and private smart home
solutions to sensors measuring air pollution, water quality, noise levels, and so on. The
data can be used in predictive maintenance, decision processes and development of
new business models. IoT solutions are already deployed in today's 4G networks, but
because 5G is faster than 4G, has better capacity and detect weaker signals, it will play
a significant role in the development of IoT. Better capacity is particularly important in
densely populated areas.
5G infrastructure will therefore be important for implementing a full-scale realisation
of IoT with a capacity that cannot be delivered by today's technology. This will enable
completely new applications in different sectors of society, such as transport, health
and care, and smart cities.
The mobile networks will be a vital enabling technology for AI, due not only to their
role as a communication infrastructure but also to the vast amount of communication
data generated by producing the services. Anonymised metadata from the mobile
networks can be used as input in systems that use AI for analysis, improving the
underlying data for decision-support, and processes controls. Such data is already
commercially available from mobile network operators (Telenor, Telia and Ice). Use of
such data falls under a range of regulations, both sectoral laws and the Personal Data
Act. The Government will monitor developments in this area and consider how to
facilitate more use of this data.
In the transport sector, deployment of the electronic communication networks,
expansion of IoT technology and access to anonymised metadata from communication
will represent key elements in leveraging the opportunities that lie in AI, such as:
self-driving and autonomous cars, buses, trucks, drones, trains and ships
intelligent traffic management, controlling and influencing behaviour in
traffic
early warning of the need to make replacements and maintain
infrastructure
prediction of travel behaviour
more advanced route optimisation
Telia (2019): Telia skal bygge ut et nasjonal 5G-nett i løpet av 2023 [Telia to deploy a national 5G
network by the end of 2023]. Press release, 8 October 2019
Transport and communication infrastructure is also a key element in the development
of smart cities and municipalities. Smart city solutions such as personalised health
services, smart energy supply, and building management systems based on big data
and AI will depend on fast and robust electronic communication networks.
The Government wants to accelerate the pace of further broadband deployment. The
draft legislation on broadband deployment includes measures to facilitate the
common use of existing physical infrastructure; measures to ensure that developers of
mobile and broadband networks receive information on, and can participate in,
ongoing and planned building and construction projects; and measures to ensure that
developers receive information on existing physical infrastructure. The new act will
require new buildings and buildings that undergo renovation to be made ready to
connect to high-speed networks.
The Government will present a white paper on electronic communication.
High-performance computing (HPC)
The amount of data in many areas of research and public administration is growing
rapidly. In addition to experiments and theory development, calculations and datadriven research have become important work methods for researchers. This creates a
growing need not only for storing and accessing data, but also for the computing
power to process the data. Scientific calculations make it possible to analyse and
identify new theoretical relationships in the vast datasets generated by, for example,
genetic sequencing, satellite observations or research vessels.
Many research projects that process large datasets can use local resources or buy
capacity from one of the large cloud service providers. If the chosen provider stores
and processes data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation, most
unclassified data can be processed in cloud services. Use of cloud services from large
commercial players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft offer more capacity (for storage
and computing power) and various commercially available analytical tools.
However, these services are often insufficient for processing larger datasets or data
requiring large-scale parallel calculations. Such situations call for larger computing
resources, which are more cost-effective to establish at national or international level.
UNINETT AS develops and operates Norway's high-speed research and education
network. UNINETT'S subsidiary, UNINETT Sigma2, is responsible for procuring,
operating and maintaining national resources for HPC and data storage in Norway.
For some research areas, such as astrophysics and marine research, the datasets are
so large and require such high computing speeds that our national resources lack the
necessary capacity. We are dependent on cooperation and on buying capacity in
international consortia. Such high-performance computing centres can have up to 100
times more capacity than the national resources.
In 2017 the European Commission took the initiative to establish the European HighPerformance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroPHC), which is jointly funded by the
European Commission and national contributions. From 2021 Norway's continued
participation in EuroPHC will depend on Norway's participation in the Horizon Europe
framework programme and the Digital Europe Programme (DEP). UNINETT Sigma2 is
Norway's national competence centre for high-performance computing in the EuroHPC
partnership.
HPC produces vital knowledge about major societal challenges
Life cycle assessments and material flow analyses are key elements for gaining an
overall picture of the environmental impacts of different products from cradle to
grave. Such analyses demand large datasets and immense computing power.
Combining data from the oceans with atmospheric measurements will provide a
better data source for climate modelling. Climate models require increasingly
higher resolution in time and space, and thereby more calculations, if they are to
provide the necessary local insights into how climate change will affect the risk of
floods, land slides and extreme weather.
Similarly, modelling of space weather will be essential for avoiding paralysis of
critical infrastructure by severe solar storms.
Health research has been revolutionised in recent years by genetic sequencing
and advanced algorithms, which in turn have opened the door to personalised
medicine and new advanced forms of treatment. These methods generate vast
amounts of sensitive data that must be analysed by high-performance computers
and stored in highly secure environments.
Source: Ministry of Education and Research
Some areas require high levels of cyber security while simultaneously allowing the data
to be processed efficiently. Relevant examples are high-resolution MR images, DNA
data, videos of patients and other sensitive data. Solutions for storing and processing
such data are mainly provided through the Service for Sensitive Data (TSD), which is
operated and developed through collaboration between the University of Oslo and
UNINETT Sigma2.
Norwegian data centres as a resource for AI
Cloud services are fundamental for enabling enterprises to exploit the potential of AI
technology. Cloud services provide access to computing power and frameworks for
machine learning, which are not available locally.
Many factors are driving the increase in data, among them IoT and the possibility to
perform more and increasingly advanced analyses on complex data sources. This
increases the demand for storage and processing capacity 'in the cloud', which in turn
increases the need to establish more data centres.
The Government wants Norway to be perceived as an attractive host country for data
centres and other data-driven industry. A national data centre strategy was published
in 2018.23 Several measures laid out in the strategy, such as reduced electricity supply
costs for data centres, removal of the 'machinery tax' and a more straightforward site
zoning process for data centres, have made Norway even more attractive to the data
centre industry. Clean energy, good communications infrastructure and political and
geological stability are other important arguments for choosing Norway as a host
country for data centres.
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (2018): Powered by Nature – Norway as a data centre
nation. Strategy
The number of data centres established in Norway has grown in recent years. Many
Norwegian data centres have major international customers, and several large
international cloud service providers have opted to establish their own data centres in
Norway. We are also witnessing a trend whereby customers – including international
companies – are moving tasks that require large amounts of computing power to
Norwegian data centres because they can offer scalable capacity based on renewable
energy. This is a positive trend from a business perspective, and provides Norway's
business and public sectors with a wider choice of suppliers. It is particularly important
for enterprises with stringent latency requirements or that process data that needs to
be stored and processed in Norway due to legal requirements (e.g. The National
Security Act).
The Government will
consider how to facilitate increased use of anonymised metadata from the
mobile networks
present a bill on broadband deployment that will contribute to accelerating
the pace of deployment of high-speed networks in Norway
facilitate the rapid rollout of 5G
present a white paper on electronic communication
consider further participation in EuroHPC in connection with Horizon Europe
and the Digital Europe Programme (DEP)
establish a marketplace for cloud services which will, among other things,
guide public agencies on procuring cloud services, with particular focus on
security

Norway will focus on artificial intelligence in areas where we have
competitive advantages, such as health, seas and oceans, public
administration, energy and mobility. Policy instruments that stimulate
investment in strong research communities, such as the centre
schemes, will be important elements.
The Government wants Norwegian research communities to be
attractive partners for leading AI enterprises and research
communities through continued investment in basic and applied ICT
research, good study programmes and competence building in AI
through courses and further education programmes at all levels.
Developing and leveraging AI
Norway will have advanced expertise in basic ICT research and AI research in order to
understand and benefit from changes in technological developments. Norwegian
communities will be attractive partners for leading business and research
communities.
Norway will invest in research and development in artificial intelligence within the longterm priority areas in the Government's long-term plan for research and higher
education: seas and oceans, environment, environmentally friendly energy, health,
public administration and civil protection.
The EU framework programmes for research and innovation represents important
arenas for cooperation and an important source of funding for Norwegian enterprises
and institutions. In the future, too, the aim is for national policy instruments to
stimulate participation in and qualification for any European programmes Norway
chooses to join.
The EU framework programmes also open the door to cooperation with countries on
other continents. Norway has entered into bilateral government agreements with
selected countries to strengthen cooperation with strong research nations. The aim is
to promote cooperation in priority areas, including AI.
The Government's goal is that investments in artificial intelligence within research,
research-based innovation and development should be concentrated on strong
research communities where cooperation between academia and industry is central,
such as in the centres of excellence and the centres for research-based innovation.
Higher education programmes should correspond to needs for advanced expertise in
the different sectors, both for competence in AI and in basic subjects such as statistics,
mathematics and information technology.
Overviews of courses and further education programmes in artificial intelligence will
be readily available. In school, digital skills, digital literacy and basic understanding of
technology will be given prominence already at primary and lower secondary level. A
basic introduction to artificial intelligence will be made available to the general
population.
1 Research and higher education
Research
There has been solid growth in research and development in ICT in recent years, with a
nominal increase from NOK 8 billion in 2007 to NOK 18 billion in 2017. Industry
accounts for the largest share of R&D investment in ICT, and most of this comprises
development activities. More recently, however (2015–2017), the strongest growth has
been in the university and university college sector.24

science and technology indicators for Norway
In 2018 the Government allocated a total of NOK 9.9 billion to the Research Council of
Norway, approximately NOK 1.4 billion of which was allocated to research, innovation
and advanced applications of ICT. The Research Council of Norway has no
programmes dealing specifically with AI, but AI has been one of several priorities in the
IKTPLUSS initiative. Calculations from 2019 show that over 40 per cent of the Research
Research Council of Norway (2019): Report on science and technology indicators for Norway
Council of Norway's allocations to ICT was awarded to projects in AI, robotics and
information management (big data). This represents almost NOK 400 million.
Between 2015 and 2019 allocations to these research areas totalled approximately
NOK 1.3 billion, of which almost NOK 400 million was allocated to research
infrastructure while over NOK 240 million was allocated to innovation projects in the
industrial sector. AI, robotics and information management are also the ICT technology
areas that grew most between 2015 and 2019 (see Figure 4). Other important ICTrelated R&D areas are data protection, security and risk.

The investment in AI is heavily influenced by the challenges and opportunities that lie
in applications, and projects that combine good AI research with advanced applications
stand a strong chance of winning the competition for funding.
The Research Council of Norway's centre schemes
The centre schemes are intended to support the best research communities and drive
pioneering research and ground-breaking innovation or to strengthen priority areas.
The centres for research-based innovation and the centres of excellence are two
examples of such schemes. The overarching objectives of the centres for researchbased innovation are to enhance innovative ability and increase value creation in the
Norwegian business sector through long-term research.
Norwegian AI Research Consortium (NORA)
In 2018 a consortium was set up aimed at strengthening Norwegian research and
education in artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and related
disciplines. The consortium comprises Norwegian universities and research
institutions engaged in research and education in artificial intelligence: the
University of Agder, the Arctic University of Norway, OsloMet, the University of
Bergen, the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Simula Research Laboratory AS,
the University of Stavanger, NORCE and the University of Oslo.

BigInsight – Statistics for the knowledge economy and Sirius – Centre for Scalable Data
Access are centres for research-based innovation that focus on AI-relevant
technologies (big data and data analysis). The Research Council of Norway is now
witnessing a trend whereby most centres for research-based innovation have one or
more activities related to artificial intelligence. Sirius is affiliated with the BigMed
project, to which the Research Council of Norway has allocated NOK 60 million for
personalised medicine and use of large-scale data analysis in healthcare.
Industrial PhD scheme
Under the industrial PhD scheme, companies can get funding from the Research
Council of Norway to allow an employee to undertake a PhD project in an area that is
relevant to the company's activities. The scheme enables companies to enhance their
long-term research competence and innovation ability and to strengthen their
collaborative relationship with academia.
The scheme is a good alternative for companies in need of targeted research activities
but with no possibility or capacity to initiate large-scale R&D projects. Figures from the
Research Council of Norway show that artificial intelligence is the area of knowledge in
ICT showing the strongest growth in the industrial PhD scheme.
The Government's ambition for Norwegian AI research
The Government considers Norway to be well placed to succeed with human-friendly
and trustworthy AI, and with AI in industrial applications. Norway has a technologically
advanced industry with the ability and will to adopt new solutions. Although large
countries such as the United States and China have resources with which neither
Norway nor Europe can compete, there are areas where Norway and Europe have
competitive advantages, such as certain industrial applications of AI and trustworthy AI
that takes data protection and ethical considerations into account.
To ensure that Norway remains internationally competitive in areas where we have
comparative advantages, it is important that AI research is integrated with investments
in these areas.
As a small country, Norway does not have the capability to build knowledge and
expertise to high international standards across the full spectrum of AI. Nevertheless,
the quality and scope of our national expertise must be sufficient to exploit the
technologies and innovations that emerge internationally. Another goal must be to
leverage our position as a nation with a digitally advanced population and business
sector in order to take the lead in applying AI, not least in industry.
Our national research and study programmes in artificial intelligence must hold a high
international standard. Artificial intelligence falls under one of the five long-term
priorities in the Government's long-term plan for research and higher education:
enabling and industrial technologies. The Government is increasing allocations to this
priority area through, among other things, the Technology Initiative escalation plan,
which is one of the stated measures in the long-term plan.
Private investments in AI research
Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)
Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) is a Swedish
research institution funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. WASP
cooperates with Sweden's five leading ICT universities. WASP focuses on two
areas in AI: the main focus area covers machine learning, deep learning and nextgeneration AI (explainable AI) and the other focus area is the mathematical
foundations of AI.
WASP also aims to recruit outstanding international researchers and to enhance
competence in Sweden and in Swedish industry by training at least 400 new PhD
candidates, of which at least 100 should be industrial PhD candidates. WASP has a
budget of SEK 3 billion up to and including 2026.
Norwegian Open AI Lab
The Telenor-NTNU AI Lab was established at the Norwegian University of Science
and Technology (NTNU) in 2017 after Telenor donated approximately NOK 50
million. The donation was made to help boost research, innovation and education
in artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analysis and IoT in Norway. In
several business partners were included in the cooperation project, and the
research centre changed its name to the Norwegian Open AI Lab. The new
partners – DNB, DNV GL, Equinor and Kongsberg – have donated funds towards
general research at NTNU and to research where AI is a central component. The
contributions from industry are donated primarily to fund researcher positions
and professorships but also physical facilities and equipment that can be used by
both researchers and students.
These types of donations from industry strengthen relationships between the
partner companies and the university. The connection to industry forms a better
platform for exploiting the opportunities that lie in artificial intelligence. This form
of cooperation will, among other things, give students and researchers
opportunities to work on authentic problems and datasets from industry,
contributing to innovation and moving the frontier of AI research forward.
Cooperation is continually being expanded to include new cooperation partners
from research and industry.

It is also important that Norwegian research communities take full advantage of the
opportunities offered by the EU framework programme, and that we leverage the
opportunities that lie in our bilateral research and technology agreements with strong
academic communities in leading research nations worldwide. Norway must be a
trustworthy and attractive partner in international cooperation, networks and
consortia dealing with research and education in artificial intelligence.
A key research policy objective is to stimulate private investment in research.25 This
includes stimulating private individuals and organisations to make donations to
research. There are general policy instruments to support this: under the gift
reinforcement programme, donations of at least NOK 3 million made to long-term,
basic research can trigger a gift reinforcement from the state worth 25 per cent of the
donated amount. This programme is administered by the Research Council of Norway.
The Norwegian Tax Administration has a scheme under which deductions from taxable
income may be granted for monetary donations made towards scientific research
conducted by pre-approved organisations.
Participation in EU programmes
Norway has actively participated in the EU's framework programmes for research and
innovation for many decades. The Research Council of Norway's policy instruments
should be designed in such a way that they stimulate and qualify for participation in
the EU programmes. Artificial intelligence and high-performance computing are areas
where we are dependent on international cooperation.
AI is included in several calls for proposals in Horizon 2020, and will have an even more
prominent place in the next EU framework programme, Horizon Europe. Investment in
innovation will also be strengthened compared with the current period.
The EU has proposed establishing a comprehensive digitalisation programme, Digital
Europe Programme (DEP), for the period 2021–2027. This is the first time the EU has
proposed a programme dedicated specifically to digitalisation.
The programme has a proposed budget of EUR 9.2 billion divided into five main areas:
high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, cyber security, digital
transformation and interoperability, and advanced digital skills. DEP is a core element
in the European Commission's efforts in digital transformation. The programme
targets areas where individual countries alone lack the necessary resources to
succeed. The resources in the programme will be used in areas where they are
expected to be most effective, such as health, justice, consumer protection and public
administration. The programme also aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises
to adapt to changes brought about by digitalisation and artificial intelligence.
Norway has made a non-binding declaration of intent to participate in the next
programme period for the research and innovation framework programme, Horizon
Europe. This will give us the opportunity to participate in the strategic planning
process. The Government is considering Norway’s possible participation in DEP.

The Government will also facilitate participation by the business sector in the European
Commission's research, innovation and development programmes. This will give
access to leading knowledge communities and markets. The Research Council of
Norway and Innovation Norway have policy instruments for providing guidance and
encouraging Norwegian actors to participate in EU programmes.
The Research Council of Norway has taken the initiative to form a national network for
artificial intelligence. The objective is to promote Norway's priorities and interests in
the strategy work that takes place in the EU and to achieve greater participation by
Norway in Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe. The network will coordinate input from
Norwegian research communities and give strategic advice concerning the Research
Council of Norway's focus areas. An important task for the network is to organise
meeting places to promote contact, cooperation and knowledge dissemination
between the research communities and increased involvement by the business and
public sectors. The network was established in the spring of 2019 and brings Norway's
leading AI communities together.
Higher education
The universities and university colleges have a high degree of autonomy. They are
responsible for following up the national sectoral goals for the university and
university college sector, one of which is to facilitate good access to education. The
institutions have responsibility for designing the study programmes. The Government
can use various means to signal which areas it wants the institutions to give priority to;
for example, by allocating resources to study places earmarked for certain subject
areas, such as nursing or cyber security. Since 2015 the Government has given
particular priority to ICT-related programmes. Increased allocations to these
programmes allow almost 1,600 more students admission to ICT-related studies every
year.
Subjects that can be classified as artificial intelligence are part of several study
programmes, but are most common in programmes in information technology and
cybernetics/robotics. In these programmes – at both bachelor and master level –
students may, to varying extents, choose courses in AI or decide to specialise in AI by
both choosing AI-relevant subjects and writing their bachelor or master's thesis in that
subject area. Typical subjects in these types of study programmes are: algorithms,
machine learning, computer vision, deep learning and big data analysis.
Some educational institutions also offer dedicated programmes in AI, but up to now
these programmes could offer relatively few study places. Since 2018, however, we see
that a growing number of educational institutions are offering separate programmes
in AI at both bachelor and master level. Institutions already offering such programmes
are expanding the number of study places. More than 350 new study places dedicated
to AI, robotics and data science are planned from 2020, compared to 2017.
More than 400 master degree candidates with a clear AI profile are estimated to have
graduated every year from 2016 to 2019. These were candidates from study
programmes dedicated to AI and candidates whose choice of course and thesis define
them as 'AI candidates'.26 The majority of these students graduated from the University
of Oslo and NTNU. In addition, just over 300 bachelor candidates graduate every year
with AI profiles. Some of them pursue master programmes in the same subject area.
Informal learning arenas: Eik idéverksted
Eik idéverksted is a makerspace for technological innovation. The makerspace is a
cooperation project between the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU),
Inkubator Ås, the Savings Bank Foundation DNB and the SpareBank 1 Foundation.
Eik idéverksted offers a range of courses, workshops, seminars and projects to
students and employees at NMBU. The aim is to serve as an active meeting place
that is open to the academic, student, local and business communities.
Many of the students who participate in Eik idéverksted learn to use AI tools at
quite advanced levels, even though they do not necessarily have the same indepth knowledge and academic background as students taking formal courses in
AI. AI is becoming increasingly accessible because companies like Google and
Facebook offer low-threshold tools in areas such as image processing, natural
language processing, prediction, and so on.
Sources: Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), eikide.org
Data on, among other things, the number of students and the number of candidates which the
institutions report to the Database for Statistics on Higher Education are not tagged to such a level
of detail as to enable retrieval of reliable figures on programmes in AI. To gain a picture of the
current situation, the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation therefore asked the
educational institutions to count the number of candidates who graduated from study
programmes in AI and the number of candidates with an 'AI profile'.
The enquiry regarding the numbers of study places and graduated candidates in AI was sent to all
the universities as well as to Østfold University College, Western Norway University of Applied
Sciences, Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, and Kristiania University College. All of
them submitted reports. As well as reporting the number of study places and the number of
candidates who took examinations at bachelor, master and PhD levels in AI, they also reported on
new study programmes in AI and on increases in the number of study places in existing AI
programmes. The institutions may have used different definitions of what constitute s an 'AI
profile' or an 'AI programme' and thus which candidates were counted.
Development of study programmes in AI
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Oslo hosts a
centre of excellence, the Centre for Computing in Science Education (CSSE), which
makes an important contribution to further developing study programmes in AI.
The faculty, through CCSE and the Centre for Teaching and Learning in Science
and Technology (KURT), offers comprehensive continuing education to
schoolteachers in order to integrate programming into school subjects. This is
done through the ProFag programming course for schoolteachers. What subjects
are taught in schools is a key factor in raising the level of higher education in
artificial intelligence, including machine learning, robotics and data science.
Source: University of Oslo
The number of PhD degrees in topics that can be defined as artificial intelligence is also
steadily growing. Moreover, methods from artificial intelligence are increasingly used
as tools by PhD candidates and researchers in other areas.
As well as seeking candidates with specific training in AI and data science, business and
industry is also interested in candidates with sound knowledge in information
technology, mathematics and statistics. Candidates like these will possess the
necessary prerequisites for understanding and learning more about AI, either through
formal education or through training in the workplace.
Need for interdisciplinarity
Knowledge of artificial intelligence, and related fields such as ethics and data
protection associated with AI applications, will be important in study programmes
oriented towards the educational sector, health, crime prevention, law and several
other fields. For example, an introductory course in artificial intelligence has been
established at the University of Bergen, in which students of medicine and
bioengineering learn about how AI can be used in clinical practice. One of the aims is
to promote interdisciplinary cooperation between physicians and engineers. The
universities of Bergen and Oslo also offer courses in artificial intelligence and machine
learning oriented towards social scientists.
Institutions of higher education ought to evaluate how topics with relevance to artificial
intelligence can be integrated into their programmes in areas that will be affected by
artificial intelligence in the coming years.
Need for knowledge about study programmes with relevance to artificial intelligence
During the work on preparing this strategy, it has become clear that official statistics
on higher education are not sufficiently detailed to provide reliable information about
the scope of the different study programmes needed to succeed with artificial
intelligence in Norway. This knowledge base must therefore be strengthened. The EU
is also working on models that can produce better knowledge on this issue, based on
official statistics and existing databases. Norway is engaged in this work, and will
evaluate whether new measurements can be based on these models.
The Government will
strengthen basic ICT research through the Research Council of Norway

study programmes in AI to meet anticipated needs in the labour market and to

places and candidates in AI
3.2 Skills
The Government wants digital skills and technology literacy to be given more
prominence already at primary and lower secondary school level. Under The
Curriculum Renewal,27 natural science will be made a more exploratory and practical
subject already at primary school level, with a distinct technology element that also
includes programming. Programming will be introduced in more subjects; among
other things, programming and computational thinking skills will be included in the
new mathematics subject.
The new curricula will come into effect in 2020. It will take a long time before the
children starting school in the autumn of 2020 complete their education and are ready
to start work or take further studies, perhaps in technology or artificial intelligence. In
the meantime there will be a need to manage the new skill requirements expected of
today's adult population in both their private and working lives.
Courses and further education programmes
An analysis from 2015 estimated a high probability that 33 per cent of jobs in Norway
would be automated over the next 20 years. These figures have subsequently been
modified, and a 2018 report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD)28 estimated that only 6 per cent of jobs in Norway were at risk of
automation. This figure is the lowest of all OECD member countries. It also emerged
that Norwegian employees – both those with and those without higher education –
were among those who receive most training in the workplace.
NAV's Horizon Scan29 deals with the most important societal trends that will affect the
future labour market. It shows that the pace of change in the labour market will
accelerate. OECD estimates that every fourth job will undergo major changes.
Technological developments will likely lead to many new jobs, but will just as likely lead
to employees having to change jobs, change the formal relationship they have with
employers, and update their skills more often. Opportunities for upskilling and
reskilling – both in the workplace and through study programmes – will therefore
become increasingly important. Development and use of artificial intelligence make up
part of this picture.
Like elsewhere, technological developments in artificial intelligence are bringing about
changes in many jobs; some work tasks will disappear, while tasks that require other
skill types will emerge. Meanwhile, ever fewer jobs will require little or no formal skills.
The Government considers it important that people who already have jobs be given
opportunities to take courses and further education. In 2020 the Government will
present a white paper on a skills reform for lifelong learning (Lære hele livet). The
objectives of the skills reform are that no one should be left behind and that more
employees should remain longer in their jobs.
The Curriculum Renewal refers to the work on renewing all the curricula in primary and lower
secondary education and in upper secondary education. The new curricula will come into effect at
the start of the school year in 2020

AI for everyone: Elements of AI
Elements of AI is a series of free online courses in artificial intelligence. The course
was developed in the spring of 2018 by the Finnish company Reaktor, its
Norwegian sister company Feed and the University of Helsinki. The aim of the
course is to teach as many as possible about what AI is, what it can and cannot be
used for, and how to start using methods based on AI. The course combines
theory with practical exercises, and requires no prior knowledge.
Elements of AI has quickly become extremely popular, and ranks top in several
overviews of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Eighteen months after it was
launched, more than 230,000 people had registered to take the course, of which
to 20 per cent have completed all the modules.
The course has attracted much larger proportions of female students (40 per
cent) and students aged over 45 (30 per cent) than is normally the case for ICT
courses. In Sweden and Finland the proportion of female students taking the
course is more than 50 per cent. Since Elements of AI was launched, the
University of Helsinki, which is the host university, has seen increases in the
number of ordinary applicants to ICT programmes and in the proportion of
female applicants.
A key factor in motivating people to complete the course is the #AIChallenge. The
#AIChallenge encourages companies and public agencies to commit to supporting
their employees to complete Elements of AI. By the autumn of 2019 more than
Finnish and Swedish organisations had taken up the challenge, among them
Telia, Nokia, Systembolaget, Nordea, Bonnier, Swedish Tax Agency and Volvo.
Elements of AI will be launched in Norwegian in cooperation with NTNU in 2020.

Employers must ensure that their employees possess the necessary skills. This
includes assessing the need for continuing and further education. Individual
employees must also take responsibility for their own skills development in a labour
market with ever increasing requirements. Nonetheless, some skill needs may not be
met, and the public sector ought to find new ways of addressing these.
To help enterprises meet new skill needs that arise, the Government has established a
range of schemes that support the development and operation of flexible further
education programmes. Several programmes in digital skills have already been
established as a result of cooperation between universities, university colleges or
tertiary vocational colleges and the labour market. The idea is to enable people to
undertake this type of further education while they are employed.
From 2020 the Government will reinforce these efforts through a new Skills
Programme and through increased allocations to a competition-based scheme
administered by the Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Quality
Enhancement in Higher Education (Diku). The target group for the programmes
developed with funding from these schemes are employees who need new skills due
to restructuring needs created by digitalisation and the transition to a green society.
Workplace training
Norway has positive experiences with handling restructuring in the labour market due
to various changes.30 Norwegian employees are good at adapting, and cooperation
between employee organisations, employer organisations and the authorities is good.
This may be one of the reasons why Norwegian employee organisations tend to seek
dialogue on how employees and employers can work together to meet the coming
challenges rather than focus their concerns on the potential negative consequences of
AI for jobs and work tasks.
Several large enterprises have launched their own further education programmes in AI
and data analysis. For example, DNB bank has offered its employees opportunities to
train as data scientists in order to meet the bank's need for competence in this area.
The Government is also cooperating with the employee and employer organisations on
an industry programme for the municipal care sector and an industry programme for
industry and construction. The costs of the industry programmes are shared among
the state, which pays for developing and operating the programmes; the enterprises,
which invest their own resources; and the employees, who invest some of their free
time. The industry programmes will also be included in the Skills Programme in 2020,
and work on the programmes will be strengthened and further developed in
cooperation between the partners.
Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund: testing AI as a training measure
When the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (Lånekassen) was introducing a
new collaboration platform in 2017, it wanted to find out whether an AI chatbot
could make training users of the platform more effective. Lånekassen decided to
use a technology supplied by the Norwegian company Boost.ai, a market leader in
conversational AI. Because testing the chatbot involved all Lånekassen employees,
they all gained insight into what a chatbot is and how it is trained.
After two weeks, Lånekassen's employees had performed close to 1,500 chats
with the robot. The system made an important contribution to the launch of the
collaboration platform, as well as illustrating how use of AI created an opportunity
to involve a whole organisation. This measure is an example of successful public–
private cooperation on using new technology and modern development
methodology. The test project has also provided experience transfer for other
public agencies such as Vy, NAV and the Norwegian Government Agency for
Financial Management (DFØ).

Student projects as a measure to access new skills and for recruitment
The Norwegian Tax Administration has in recent years hosted summer projects
using AI, such as Pattern Recognition in Cryptocurrency and AI-assisted Tax
Returns. The objective of these projects is to test new technologies. Participants
are recruited from technology study programmes in AI, machine learning,
programming and statistical methods, among others. The projects not only
provide the Norwegian Tax Administration with an opportunity to conduct
interesting pilot projects in relevant areas; they also give the agency the chance to
present itself as a potential workplace for students who will be highly sought-after
in the labour market once they graduate.

the innovation potential in applying artificial intelligence. The
Government will evaluate how industrial policy instruments can best
be designed to support potential value creation and use of AI in the
business sector.
Public agencies ought to actively explore the potential of the
technology, and increased interaction between the public sector and
the business sector should promote innovation and value creation.
Enhancing innovation
capacity using AI
Norway can take a leading position in applying artificial intelligence, particularly in
areas where we already are well positioned and have strong business and research
communities, such as health, oil and gas, energy, the maritime and marine industries
and the public sector.
The foundation we lay in the form of access to good infrastructure, data sharing,
research and competence building will also provide a good starting point for increased
innovation and value creation for small but technologically advanced companies.
The largest public agencies already serve as a driving force in AI by actively exploring
the potential that lies in this technology. The Government will facilitate sharing of best
practice across sectors and enterprises.
Increased interaction and cooperation between the public and business sectors, and
between research communities and the business sector, are vital to unlocking the
innovative potential of applying artificial intelligence in the form of both established
and new models of cooperation.
The public sector ought to actively explore opportunities in the market in connection
with procurements, and innovative public procurements should be used wherever
appropriate. To facilitate innovative solutions, agencies ought to focus on their needs
rather than on specific products or services.
1 Industrial policy instruments
The authorities play an important role in facilitating business development, also with
regard to AI. However, the business sector also has a responsibility to develop and
adopt technologies that can create better, more profitable services or more efficient
operations.
The underlying assumption is that companies and enterprises invest less in research
and development than what is profitable for society as a whole. As part of Norway's
research and innovation system, public authorities therefore facilitate innovation
through grants and other schemes administered by the system of policy instruments
for research and innovation. Several policy instruments currently available promote
research in, and development, testing and commercialisation of, artificial intelligence.
Support for the early phase, where more emphasis is placed on research and researchbased innovation, is usually provided through the Research Council of Norway.
Innovation Norway has a responsibility to promote innovation, value creation and
growth in business and industry through, among other things, financial contributions
and expertise. In recent years Innovation Norway has arranged the Tech City Executive
Accelerator (TEA) initiative for companies oriented towards AI and IoT. The aim is to
make executives in expanding Norwegian companies aware of the opportunities for
leveraging AI and IoT. TEA is based in London.
The Industrial Development Corporation of Norway (Siva) facilitates innovation through
infrastructure such as business gardens, incubators and initiatives such as the
Norwegian Catapult scheme. Investinor is a state-owned venture investment company
whose purpose is to improve access to capital in the early-stage market (the market for
investment capital for companies in the process of developing new products or
processes). Export credit and guarantee schemes help Norwegian businesses enhance
their competitiveness in the international market.
Innovation project: Machine learning in seismology
Earth Science Analytics AS leads an industry innovation project that receives
funding via the Research Council of Norway's PETROMAKS 2 programme Machine
Learning in Geoscience. The project shows how digitalisation and artificial
intelligence are in the process of transforming the seismic industry.
Today geologists spend around 70 per cent of their time on seismic interpretation.
Artificial intelligence could automate some parts of the interpretation process.
This would make retrieving relevant information from seismic data far easier and
more efficient. The technology can also be combined with tools for analysing well
data. This will help the oil companies make better decisions based on large
amounts of reliable data.

Digital21
Digital21 is a strategy developed by and for businesses. The goal has been to
make recommendations to the authorities on how businesses can better develop
and benefit from competence, technology, research and development in order to
succeed in digitalisation. An important message in the strategy is that Norway
cannot be best at everything, and should therefore give priority to the technology
areas where Norwegian business and industry can profit most. Digital21
highlights artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things and autonomous
systems as particularly important technologies for Norway in the time ahead.
Source: digital21.no
Some countries have introduced grant schemes for businesses that start up AI
projects. In Sweden, for example, Vinnova has established a scheme to which
companies and public enterprises can apply for grants of up to SEK 500,000 to start up
their first AI project. Norway has no schemes specifically for R&D in AI; instead we have
a broader scheme, SkatteFUNN, through which Norwegian companies can apply for
tax deductions on R&D costs. SkatteFUNN is a rights-based scheme with simple
application processes and reporting requirements.
Forskerpool [Researcher Pool] is a scheme affiliated to SkatteFUNN to which businesses
can apply for up to 50 hours of assistance from a researcher to develop an idea or get
feedback on a problem. This scheme may be particularly relevant for SMEs, which
often lack this type of in-house expertise. In AI, where there is a shortage of personnel
with advanced skills, schemes like these where resources are shared can help more
companies gain access to the expertise they need to start their projects or pilots.
Business clusters represent a policy instrument that can be suitable for promoting
business development in AI. Innovation Norway, the Research Council of Norway, and
Siva currently fund a cluster programme. The business community takes on the roles
of leading and coordinating the business clusters, but research institutions and public
agencies are often members.
Cluster for applied AI
In Halden, eSmart Systems, the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), Østfold
University College and the research and innovation company Smart Innovation
Norway have taken the initiative to develop a new cluster, the Cluster for Applied
AI. The ambition is to create an optimal platform for developing Norwegian
companies' international competitiveness and sustainable social development
through applied AI. The purpose of the cluster is to create new jobs and
sustainable development based on rapid development and application of AI. Key
focus areas will be technological development, commercialisation, ethics, security
and accessibility. The cluster will facilitate the sharing of data, infrastructure and
other technologies that its members would otherwise be unable to invest in.

DigitalNorway
DigitalNorway is a non-profit organisation whose mission is to make it easier for
Norwegian businesses to succeed with digitalisation. DigitalNorway cooperates
with research and educational institutions, business clusters and several of
Norway's best competence and innovation communities. Among other things, the
organisation provides tools for companies that want to make the transition from
idea to product or service, and networks for sharing knowledge and experiences.
The Conversion Engine service helps companies build their in-house expertise in
digitalisation and advanced production. Together with Smart Innovation Norway,
NCE iKuben and NCE Kongsberg Innovasjon, DigitalNorway leads the work on the
Conversion Engine for digitalisation while NCE Raufoss has corresponding
responsibility for manufacturing/advanced production. The aim is to help small
and medium-sized enterprises throughout the country succeed in their digital
transformation. Innovation Norway supports the programme.

There are also good examples of the business sector launching its own initiatives.
Measures such as the AI Village in Trondheim, where several companies have joined
forces to leverage synergies and create a stronger community, are good examples of
how cooperation within the business sector can produce positive effects.
Review of the system of policy instruments
In 2018 the Government launched a comprehensive review of the system of business
policy instruments.31 The purpose is for Norway to derive maximum value creation and
economically sustainable jobs within sustainable parameters from the resources that
are channelled through the system of policy instruments.
EU policy instruments for AI targeting SMEs: Digital Innovation Hubs
Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) is a policy instrument that was launched by the
European Commission in 2016 to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to
digitalise faster. The first generation of DIHs was created under Horizon 2020. Four
Norwegian DIHs have been set up, affiliated with GCE NODE in Agder, SINTEF, Oslo
Cancer Cluster and Digital Norway, all of which are active enablers for SMEs.
In the transition to the new EU programmes for 2021–2027, a new generation of larger
and more binding DIHs will be introduced. These will be one-stop shops, and will cover
an ecosystem (national and international) that can offer expertise and competence
and contribute to enabling SMEs in particular to become digital and leverage the
potential of artificial intelligence. Funding for the projects will come from the Digital
Europe Programme, among others.
The DIH programme and Norway's catapult scheme share some common features.
The Government has established Norwegian Catapult, a scheme that gives Norwegian
industry access to test facilities in order to enhance innovation and value creation.
Updated information on the review of the system of business-oriented policy instruments is
available (in Norwegian) at www.regjeringen.no/vmg
NOK 125 million was allocated to the scheme in the 2019 national budget. Siva has
given priority to further developing the catapult scheme in 2019, in cooperation with
Innovation Norway and the Research Council of Norway.
In Norway the clusters will be key participants in the DIHs that are set up. One
important task for the system of policy instruments will be to further develop
complementarity between the hubs, the cluster programme and the catapult scheme.
Intellectual property rights
Protecting intellectual property rights is important for ensuring that the AI market
develops in the right way. Any uncertainty about ownership of the various elements
that make up solutions based on AI (data, development framework, pre-trained
algorithms, etc.), how they are licensed or how access to the solutions is paid for, will
have negative impacts.
The Government wants Norwegian companies to make informed and competent
decisions regarding protection, use and enforcement of their intellectual assets and
rights, and to have a professional and conscious approach to the way they handle the
rights of others. Norwegian companies should secure the increased market access and
value creation which professional protection and use of copyright law can afford them.
Protecting their ownership rights can be particularly decisive in connection with
internationalisation.
The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries has begun mapping competence levels
and needs in the area of intellectual property rights in Norwegian industry, and will
assess whether the guidance offered on the system of policy instruments is adequate.
Public agencies can find it particularly difficult to know how to deal with rights when
development of an AI-based solution is conducted through cooperation between the
public sector and a private company: for example, how should a public agency handle
ownership and user rights in a partnership where a commercial party develops and
trains algorithms using the public agency's data? This type of issue will likely arise in
the future, and perhaps especially so in connection with using health data for
commercial purposes.
One important exception here, of course, is open data, which may freely be used by
both commercial and public actors, pursuant to the Norwegian Licence for Open
Government Data (NLOD) or under a Creative Commons licence.

In the UK the National Health Service (Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust) has
cooperated with Google DeepMind on developing an algorithm that can identify
eye diseases based on images of the eye. The agreement makes DeepMind the
owner of the final system but entitles Moorfields to the right to use it free of
charge for a given number of years after it is approved for clinical use.

Standardisation
Norway can contribute to ensuring that artificial intelligence develops in the desired
direction by exerting influence on international standards related to AI. Such influence
is exerted by participating in international standardisation activities and by chairing
working groups in areas that are important for us. At global level, AI activities are
conducted in the standardisation organisations ISO and EIC and at European level in
CEN and CENELEC. It is most often the large companies that take an active part in
standardisation activities. The threshold for participating in this type of activity can be
high for many SMEs for various reasons, such as travel costs or the time involved.
Standard Norway has created a mirror committee (SN/K 586 Kunstig Intelligens) to
follow up international standardisation activities in AI. The committee is composed of
representatives from research, business and industry, national authorities and various
interest organisations.
The Government will
work towards enabling the Digital Innovation Hubs to help SMEs get started on
applying AI
engage in dialogue with Digital Norway on how it can enable SMEs to take
more advantage of the potential of AI
promote the work on international standardisation activities related to AI,
particularly with regard to stimulating SMEs to participate in these activities

develop guidelines, including proposals for standard agreement clauses, on
how public agencies should deal with ownership rights when cooperating with
the business sector on developing artificial intelligence
4.2 AI-based innovation in the public sector
The Government believes there is vast potential for the public sector to rationalise and
create better services through digitalisation. Artificial intelligence is one aspect of this.
In the future the public sector will use artificial intelligence to deliver more targeted
and user-adapted services, enhance the social benefit of its own activities, rationalise
operations and work processes, and reduce risk.
Artificial intelligence in the public sector can contribute to:
more relevant advice and services to citizens in different situations in life
better decision-making support for public-sector employees
rationalising processes and optimising resource utilisation
improving the quality of processes and services by automatically detecting
possible deviations
predicting trends based on data from both agencies and their
environments
natural language processing for sorting and categorising, and for
translating between different languages and language forms
Use of AI in the public sector is still in an early phase, however. A survey 32 shows that
many agencies are still in the planning or testing phase, where they try to find out what
AI can be used for. Some agencies have begun testing through proofs of concepts. The
survey shows that more than half of the agencies regards organisational culture, legal
and regulatory issues, and data protection and security as the major challenges with
respect to AI. Lack of competence is highlighted as another challenge.
For example, agencies can find it difficult to assess which areas are suitable for AI. One
area that raises several dilemmas is the use of AI for control purposes. Such controls
can involve, for example, identifying individuals who may be violating regulations (that
is to say where an algorithm identifies a high probability for this). For applications like
these, consideration must be given to rule of law and protection against self-incrimination for individuals subjected to regulatory checks. The risk and consequences of
false positives – i.e., of someone being wrongly identified and of the undue hardship
this would impose on them – must be part of a data protection impact assessment,
which must be included when a solution is under evaluation.
Such assessments related to the use of AI in public administration can prove
challenging, particularly if the agency lacks the relevant in-house expertise. Uncertainty
over regulations for processing personal data, relevance to the Public Administration
Act or assessments of when it is acceptable to use AI may make agencies unduly
reticent. This may deprive the public sector of important opportunities to improve its
services or rationalise its processes. The Government will therefore ask the Norwegian
Digitalisation Agency to prepare guidance on this matter, in cooperation with the
Norwegian Data Protection Authority.

status, utfordringer og behov i norsk offentlig sektor Første resultater. [Artifical intelligence/data
science: A mapping of status, challenges and needs in Norway's public sector. Initial results].

Projects using AI in public administration
The Government wants public sector organisations to facilitate experimenting with
artificial intelligence to gain knowledge about and experience in the technology. Trial
projects or pilots in AI will provide valuable experience that can be used when
evaluating large-scale projects and can enhance understanding of the technology at all
levels in the organisation.
Artificial intelligence is one of many important tools for developing sustainable public
administration in both central government and the municipal sector. Cooperation and
exchange of best practice across organisations will contribute to better insights into AI,
and experiences gained by the large agencies, which often have their own IT and
analysis units, can help smaller organisations get started on AI projects.
The municipal sector is in a unique position when it comes to potential cooperation,
because all municipalities have an obligation to provide the same services to their
inhabitants, which means they hold datasets covering the same areas. The possibility
to share best practice and to cooperate on procurements and training measures may
therefore be particularly important for the municipalities. Cooperation on data,
algorithms and competence in AI may also create possibilities to see interrelationships
across sectors.
Examples of projects using AI in the public sector
Several public agencies have conducted projects in which they have used artificial
intelligence:
Artificial intelligence in residence verification
The Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (Lånekassen) has conducted a
project using artificial intelligence to select students for residence verification. In
Lånekassen’s residential verification process covered 25,000 students, of
which 15,000 were selected using artificial intelligence (machine learning) and
10,000 were selected randomly (control group). The results showed that the
selection made using machine learning was twice as effective at identifying
students who had not documented previously submitted residence information
compared to the control group.
Automatic posting of invoices
Customers of The Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Management
(DFØ) spend considerable time and resources on posting incoming invoices due to
uncertainty about the correct posting. In some cases this can lead to invoices
being paid after the due date and can create extra costs for the agency in the
form of interest and charges. DFØ is currently testing solutions from two
companies, one of which involves an accounting robot that uses AI to propose the
correct posting. The model is trained using historical data before making a
prediction of the posting based on a combination of historical data and
information obtained from the actual invoice.

Financial Management
The Government will therefore ask the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency to facilitate
cooperation in AI for example by establishing common use cases/user journeys and
sharing of best practice.
Public-private partnerships
Norway's public sector procures goods and services worth more than NOK 500 billion
annually. These procurements can be used to promote innovation and use of new
technologies. A study conducted by Menon33 shows that most public procurement
processes are conducted without any market dialogue and without encouraging
suppliers to supply systems that are radically new and innovative. The companies
report that young, innovative companies in particular find it difficult to know what they
need to do to win contracts.
An innovation partnership is a procurement procedure that facilitates product and
service development through cooperation between buyers and developers/suppliers.
Innovation partnerships are used for procuring solutions that are not currently
available in the market. Preliminary experiences show that startups and technology
companies win assignments in innovation partnerships more easily than in other
public tendering processes.
One of the measures in the Government's digital strategy 34 is to establish a
programme for increased interaction between the public sector and start-up
companies, modelled on similar programmes in the United States and the United
Kingdom. Such a programme would also benefit companies whose activities are based
on artificial intelligence.

The Government wants Norway to lead the way in developing and
using AI with respect for individual rights and freedoms. In Norway,
artificial intelligence will be based on ethical principles, respect for
privacy and data protection, and good cyber security.
Trustworthy AI
Norway is known for the high level of trust citizens have in each other and in public
and private institutions. The Government wants to maintain and strengthen this trust
at the same time as artificial intelligence is adopted in new and innovative ways.
The Government believes that:
artificial intelligence that is developed and used in Norway should be built
on ethical principles and respect human rights and democracy
research, development and use of artificial intelligence in Norway should
promote responsible and trustworthy AI
development and use of AI in Norway should safeguard the integrity and
privacy of the individual
cyber security should be built into the development, operation and
administration of AI solutions
supervisory authorities should oversee that AI systems in their areas of
supervision are operated in accordance with the principles for responsible
and trustworthy use of AI
5.1 Issues related to artificial intelligence
Developing and using artificial intelligence can create challenges and raise many
complex questions. This particularly applies to AI that builds on personal data.
Big data versus data minimisation
A certain amount of data is needed to develop and use artificial intelligence. At the
same time, one of the key principles of data protection is data minimisation, which
requires the amount of personal data collected to be limited to what is necessary for
fulfilling the purpose for collecting it. Consequently, the need for large datasets can
conflict with the principle of data minimisation. Although enterprises planning to
implement a project based on AI will want to obtain as much data as possible, the
starting point must be to select a relevant sample and a dataset that is sufficiently
large.
Enterprises can also consider whether there are other more privacy-friendly methods
of gaining access to the personal data needed, such as anonymised data, synthetic
datasets or various encryption methods. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has
published a guide on artificial intelligence and privacy which covers this and other
issues.35
Data quality
It is not only the amount of data that is important for artificial intelligence; the quality
and structure of the data must also be good. Any errors in the data can have an impact
on the analyses performed. Moreover, there must be metadata describing the content
of the different data fields. A good start is for individual organisations to put their own
house in order36, meaning that they gain an overview of what data they manage, what
the data means, what it is used for, what processes it is used in, and whether legal
authority exists for sharing it.
One challenge to quality that particularly applies to artificial intelligence is what is
known as bias. Bias occurs if we have datasets which only contain information about
part of the relevant source data. If an algorithm that is meant to recognize images of
dogs is only trained using images of dogs playing with balls, the algorithm may reason
that it cannot be a picture of a dog if no ball appears in the image. Similarly, it is
problematic if an algorithm meant for facial recognition is trained on images of faces
from a single ethnic group.
Bias can occur for other reasons; for example, a training dataset for supervised
learning may contain bias resulting from human misjudgements or historical bias in
the source data (on account of, for example, the conventional view of men as holders
of certain types of positions, or if the data contains more images of women than men
by a kitchen sink). Artificial intelligence can also be influenced by who defines the
problems.

www.datatilsynet.no/en/regulations-and-tools/reports-on-specific-subjects/ai-and-privacy/
Difi (2018): Veileder for orden i eget hus [Guide to putting one's own house in order].
Lack of transparency
One challenge with artificial intelligence is the lack of transparency in some solutions
based on deep learning. Some deep learning algorithms can be likened to a 'black box',
where one has no access to the model that can explain why a given input value
produces a given outcome. Most systems based on AI are not black boxes, however,
and render it possible to understand and document how decisions are made. In areas
where explainability is important, an alternative approach to deep learning might be
more appropriate.
At the same time, much research is being conducted in the field of 'explainable AI',
which aims to make black box algorithms explainable. This is not the same as
publishing the code behind an algorithm or allowing full access to full datasets,
because such an approach may breach intellectual property rights and data protection
laws. Instead, explainable AI can analyse what data had significance for the outcome
and what significance the different elements had, and thereby explain the logic behind
the outcome.
Autonomy
Finally, the fact that artificial intelligence is characterised by autonomy, and that it can
make decisions and initiate actions without human interaction, presents a challenge.
Although the degree of autonomy will vary, it nonetheless raises questions about
responsibility for the consequences of such decisions and how such autonomy can be
limited. The initial discussions on ethics for artificial intelligence originated in issues of
autonomy.37
2 Ethical principles for artificial intelligence
In its Global Risk Report 2017, the World Economic Forum characterises artificial
intelligence as one of the emerging technologies with the greatest potential benefits
but also the greatest risks. There is therefore a need to continuously discuss what is
responsible and desirable development and what we can do to prevent undesirable
development in this area.
The European Commission set up an expert group which has drawn up ethical
guidelines for trustworthy use of artificial intelligence.38 The guidelines are based on
the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and on international human rights law.
The purpose of the guidelines is to promote responsible and sustainable development
and use of artificial intelligence in Europe.
For development and use of AI to be defined as trustworthy, the European
Commission's high-level expert group believes that it must be lawful, ethical and robust.
On this basis, the expert group has proposed seven principles for ethical and
responsible development of artificial intelligence. The Government will adopt these
principles as its basis for responsible development and use of artificial intelligence in
Norway.
See for example Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics. Asimov, Isaac (1950): 'Runaround'. I, Robot
(The Isaac Asimov Collection edition.). New York City: Doubleday
Independent High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission
: Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI
The principles largely address artificial intelligence that builds on data from or that
affects humans, but they are also relevant for industrial use of AI built on data that
does not constitute personal data.
Satisfying all seven principles simultaneously can prove challenging. Tensions may
arise that create a need to make trade-offs. Such trade-offs should be addressed in a
rational and methodological manner. Where no ethically acceptable trade-offs can be
identified, the development and use of the AI solution should not proceed in its
current form.
All decisions made regarding trade-offs must be reasoned and documented. If unjust
adverse impacts occur in a solution built on AI, mechanisms should be in place to
ensure that such impacts can be reported. Particular attention should be paid to
vulnerable persons or groups, such as children.
1) AI-based solutions must respect human autonomy and control
The development and use of artificial intelligence must foster a democratic and fair
society by strengthening and promoting the fundamental freedoms and rights of the
individual. Individuals must have the right not to be subject to automated processing
when the decision made by the system significantly affects them. Individuals must be
included in decision-making processes to assure quality and give feedback at all stages
in the process ('human-in-the-loop').
2) AI-based systems must be safe and technically robust
AI must be built on technically robust systems that prevent harm and ensure that the
systems behave as intended. The risk of unintentional and unexpected harm must be
minimised. Technical robustness is also important for a system's accuracy, reliability
and reproducibility.
3) AI must take privacy and data protection into account
Artificial intelligence built on personal data or on data that affects humans must
respect the data protection regulations and the data protection principles in the
General Data Protection Regulation.
4) AI-based systems must be transparent
Decisions made by systems built on artificial intelligence must be traceable,
explainable and transparent. This means that individuals or legal persons must have
an opportunity to gain insight into how a decision that affects them was made.
Traceability facilitates auditability as well as explainability. Transparency is achieved by,
among other things, informing the data subject of the processing. Transparency is also
about computer systems not pretending to be human beings; human beings must
have the right to know if they are interacting with an AI system.
5) AI systems must facilitate inclusion, diversity and equal treatment
When developing and using AI, it is especially important to ensure that AI contribute to
inclusion and equality, and that discrimination be avoided. Datasets that are used to
train AI systems can contain historical bias, be incomplete or incorrect. Identifiable and
discriminatory bias should, if possible, be removed in the collection phase. Bias can be
counteracted by putting in place oversight processes to analyse and correct the
system’s decisions in light of the purpose.
6) AI must benefit society and the environment
Artificial intelligence must be developed with consideration for society and the
environment, and must have no adverse effects on institutions, democracy or society
at large.
7) Accountability
The requirement of accountability complements the other requirements, and entails
the introduction of mechanisms to ensure accountability for solutions built on AI and
for their outcomes, both before and after the solutions are implemented. All AI
systems must be auditable.
The Government wants public debate on the ethical use of artificial intelligence and on
what applications of artificial intelligence we want to adopt in Norway. Norway has a
number of bodies whose mandate is to invite public debate on technology and ethics,
such as the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, the Norwegian Board of Technology,
and the Norwegian National Committees for Research Ethics.
Privacy by design and ethics
Algorithms can be controlled by facilitating access or audit, but it is more appropriate
for developers as well as users to build privacy and ethical considerations into systems
from the outset. Such a mindset has already been established with regard to privacy.
Privacy by design is a key requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation, and
means that consideration must be given to privacy in all phases of development of a
system or solution. This is so as to ensure that information systems meet the
requirements of the Personal Data Act and safeguard the rights of the individual.
Likewise, ethical considerations should be built into algorithms during development.
Among other things, it will be important to assess whether an algorithm may lead to
discrimination and whether it is sufficiently robust to withstand manipulation. Ethical
evaluations may also call for considering potential environmental impacts and whether
a system contributes to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Work on privacy by design and ethics require those who work on solutions based on AI
to possess or acquire the necessary competence. Higher education institutions ought
to evaluate how privacy and ethics can be integrated into their programmes in, for
example, information technology and data science.
Artificial intelligence and research ethics
The act relating to the organisation of work on ethics and integrity in research (Lov om
organisering av forskningsetisk arbeid) imposes a duty of care on researchers and
research institutions to ensure that all research be conducted in accordance with
recognised standards for research ethics. Research institutions have a responsibility to
ensure that candidates and employees receive training in recognised standards for
research ethics and that everyone conducting or participating in research be familiar
with them. The National Committee for Research Ethics in Science and Technology
recently submitted a report on research ethics in which it proposes nine principles for
AI research in three areas:39
Den nasjonale forskningsetiske komité for naturvitenskap og teknologi (2019): Forskningsetisk
betenkning om kunstig intelligens
A) Responsibility for development and use of autonomous systems:
Research in AI must safeguard human dignity, assign responsibility, be
explainable, and promote informed public debate.
Social implications and responsible research:
Research in AI must acknowledge uncertainties and ensure broad
involvement.
Big data:
Research in AI must protect privacy and the interests of individuals,
ensure reproducibility and quality, and promote equal access to data.
Challenges for consumers
Use of AI offers many advantages to consumers, such as the development of an ever
increasing range of new services that simplify everyday life. But it also presents
challenges with respect to privacy, transparency and consumer rights. Consumers are
particularly vulnerable when AI is used to develop personalised services and targeted
marketing based on collecting and processing consumers' personal data. There is
growing concern internationally that businesses are failing to take consumers' privacy
seriously enough.
A survey from Consumers International40 shows that consumers appreciate what AI
technology can do; it gives them independence, entertainment and motivation in new
and interesting ways. But the survey also shows that consumers are unsure about how
their personal data is used and who is behind the data processing. They seek more
clarity and control.
When services and marketing are made increasingly personalised, consumers risk
being subjected to discriminatory treatment and arbitrary non-transparent decisions
such as price discrimination. Moreover, personalised marketing and other commercial
practices developed using AI can manipulate and mislead consumers into making
decisions that are not in their interests.
AI affects many aspects of consumer's social life and will encompass different sectors
of society. The use of AI raises legal issues under various sectoral legislation,
particularly in competition, privacy and data protection, and consumer protection. It is
therefore important that the relevant supervisory authorities cooperate on this issue.
They should develop competence and information, and participate in international
forums such as the Digital Clearinghouse, the European forum for consumer,
competition and data protection enforcement bodies. In the white paper on the
consumer of the future,41 the Government announced that it will create a similar
cooperation forum at national level: Digital Clearinghouse Norway.
Regulation of artificial intelligence in the consumer sector
Norway has a tradition of strong consumer protection laws. Efforts are being made in
Norway and the EU to provide consumers with strong and enforceable rights that are
adapted to digital life. As part of these efforts, the EU has adopted a number of
regulatory acts that will strengthen consumer rights online, such as the proposed
package of measures called the New Deal for Consumers. While these regulatory acts

Meld. St. 25 (2018-2019) Framtidas forbrukar – grøn, smart og digital. [Report to the Storting no. 25
(2018-2019 Consumer of the future – green, smart and digital]
do not specifically address AI, the European Commission has stressed that AI will be
one of the key areas in the time ahead.42 Norwegian authorities have been closely
monitoring the EU's work on modernisation of consumer rights and will continue to do
so.
International cooperation on ethical and trustworthy AI
Norway is engaged in an array of international forums that work on strategies and
guidelines for ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence, among them the UN, EU,
OECD and the Nordic Council of Ministers.
United Nations
Norway participates in processes, activities and discussions across the UN system
dealing with applications of AI. Thematic areas in which AI is given attention span from
eliminating hunger, combating climate change and efforts to promote good health for
all to discussing disarmament and international security. 43
European Union
Norway, represented by the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation, has
participated in EU activities related to AI from the start, and was involved in, among
other things, preparing the European Commission's Coordinated Plan on Artificial
Intelligence from December 2018.44 The EU is working towards human-centric and
trusted AI. Norway participates in this work and sits on the steering group that is
developing a coordinated approach to AI together with the European Commission and
the member states.
The European Commission is expected to submit a legislative proposal on AI regulation
in 2020. A new regulatory framework for AI is expected to build on the ethical
principles for developing and using AI published by the EU's high-level expert group in
April 2019, on which the Government has based its ethical principles for AI. Norway will
be actively involved in the work carried out on any future regulatory framework for AI.
OECD
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working on AI
and has published several reports on the topic. Norway, represented by the Ministry of
Local Government and Modernisation, has participated in OECD's work on preparing a
recommendation on artificial intelligence.45 This was finally approved on 22 May 2019.
The recommendation identifies key values for trustworthy AI, namely: inclusive growth,
sustainable development and well-being; human-centred values and fairness;
transparency and explainability; robustness, security and safety; and accountability. In
addition, OECD makes recommendations pertaining to R&D in AI, fostering a digital
ecosystem for AI and shaping public policy on AI. The importance of building human
capacity and preparing for labour market transformation is also highlighted.
European Commission (2018) Communication from the commission to the European Parliament, the
Council and the European Economic and Social Committee – A new deal for consumers
In 2018 the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) published a summary of UN activities on
AI: handle.itu.int/11.1002/pub/8120d5d5-en

OECD (2019): Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence, OECD/LEGAL/0449
Furthermore, the OECD points out the importance of international cooperation for
ensuring ethical and trustworthy AI.
Council of Europe
The Council of Europe is concerned with the potential impacts of AI on human rights.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has as of 2019 not yet heard any cases in
which artificial intelligence has been the central issue, though it has touched on the
topic in some contexts. In the autumn of 2019 the Council of Europe set up an ad-hoc
committee to examine the opportunities and risks posed by AI in respect of human
rights. Norway, represented by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, participates
in this work.
Nordic Council of Ministers and Nordic–Baltic cooperation
Nordic cooperation on digitalisation will promote the Nordic and Baltic countries as a
cohesive and integrated digital region. Through binding cooperation and projects, the
Nordic countries will find solutions to problems encountered by citizens and
businesses, promote innovative technologies and services, and make it easier to
develop new services for individuals and businesses throughout the region. Nordic–
Baltic agreements have been signed on closer cooperation on 5G, AI and data sharing.
The Government will
encourage development and use of artificial intelligence in Norway to be
based on ethical principles and to respect human rights and democracy
encourage industry and interest organisations to establish their own industry
standards or labelling or certification schemes based on the principles for
responsible use of artificial intelligence
encourage the educational institutions to consider how privacy and ethics can
be given a central place in their programmes in artificial intelligence
expect the supervisory authorities to have the competence and authority to
supervise artificial intelligence systems within their areas of supervision in
order to, among other things, ensure compliance with the principles for
responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence
establish a cooperation forum for consumer, competition and data protection
enforcement bodies: Digital Clearinghouse Norway
continue to participate in European and international forums, including the
EU's work towards creating a regulatory framework to promote responsible
and trustworthy use of artificial intelligence and towards modernising
consumer rights in light of digital developments

stimulate public debate on the ethical use of artificial intelligence
5.3 Security
To ensure a well-functioning digital society, we must minimise the risk of being
affected by adverse cyber incidents. The Government therefore considers cyber
security to be a priority area.
In January 2019 the Government presented a national strategy for cyber security 46 and
a national strategy for cyber security competence.47 The cyber security strategy defines
goals for five priority areas:
Norwegian companies shall digitalise in a secure and trustworthy manner,
and improve their capability to protect themselves against cyber incidents.
Critical societal functions shall be supported by robust and reliable digital
infrastructure.
Enhanced cyber security competence shall be aligned with the needs of
society.
Norwegian society shall improve its capability to detect and manage cyber
attacks.
The police shall enhance its capability to combat cyber crime.
The Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry of Defence have
overarching responsibility for following up the National Cyber Security Strategy for
Norway. The individual ministries are responsible for ensuring that the strategy’s
priorities and measures are followed up in their respective sectors.
Cyber security and artificial intelligence have two aspects: security in solutions based
on artificial intelligence, and solutions based on artificial intelligence for enhanced
cyber security. The competence needs in these areas will largely overlap. There is also
a need for in-depth specialisation in security architecture for protecting AI systems,
and for specialisation in algorithms/big data for using AI to protect IT systems and
society.
Security in AI-based systems
Implementing an AI system entails applying conventional technologies such as sensors,
communication networks, data centres, big data and software. An AI system will inherit
vulnerabilities from these technologies and will also introduce new vulnerabilities as
part of the new AI-based solution. In this respect, AI systems are no different from
conventional IT or from conventional methods of working on cyber security.
As with other IT systems, a structured, holistic approach to cyber security is needed
before an AI system is deployed. The Norwegian National Security Authority's basic
principles for cyber security provide all Norwegian organisations with a good starting
point for identifying what they should consider in their security activities, regardless of
size, maturity and competence.

Artificial intelligence in law enforcement
The Norwegian Police University College and NTNU in Gjøvik are cooperating on a
project that examines the use of different forms of artificial intelligence for
analysing big data, aimed at detecting, preventing and investigating economic
crime. The objective of the Ars Forensica project is to produce new knowledge
that can improve prevention, investigation and prosecution of incidents without
compromising privacy and the rule of law. Some examples of the research
challenges are:
vast amounts of electronic data that need to be analysed
fragments of evidence that are hidden in chaotic environments
varying quality in digital trails, and possibilities to plant/distort
digital trails
dynamic environments and continually changing
situations/contexts
lack of knowledge, and
decisions characterised by uncertainty and conjecture
The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway's IKTPLUSS programme.

For many organisations, AI as a service will be provided by external parties with the
necessary competence and computing power. This can create challenges in terms of
transparency, integrity, accountability and traceability. This must be taken into account
when procuring the service. Both the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency and the
Norwegian National Security Authority have issued guidance material on security in
connection with outsourcing and procuring cloud services.
An AI-based IT system must be trustworthy as well as robust, secure, safe and
accurate. Depending on the system's purpose, error or manipulation can in some
cases have significantly more far-reaching consequences for an AI system than for a
conventional IT system. This must be taken into account when performing a risk
assessment of such systems.
Protection of digital infrastructure
The existing early warning system for digital infrastructure has been used to
detect targeted cyber attacks for almost 20 years. The Norwegian National
Security Authority is now developing new sensor technology that will build on and
eventually replace the sensors used in the existing early warning system. A new
platform will be developed to use artificial intelligence and machine learning on
the data collected. The platform will enable automatic analysis of any malware
detected as well as automatic sharing of results.

Use of AI for enhanced cyber security
Systems built on artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly widespread, and will
be one of the prerequisites for the success of Norway's future digitalisation efforts.
This also applies to organisations engaged in security activities and in cyber security in
particular.
Most security organisations regard the use of AI systems as necessary for identifying
threats and threat agents, and for being able to withstand and manage cyber attacks.
AI-based cyber security solutions contribute to faster detection and management of
incidents and to more precise and detailed analysis.
Machine learning and data-driven technology can also help prevent vulnerabilities in
