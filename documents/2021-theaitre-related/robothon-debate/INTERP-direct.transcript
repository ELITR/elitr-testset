Please come.
Let me know, welcome my colleagues from the He Institute, the formal and applied linguistics of the Faculty of mathematics and physics welcome Rudolf.
And we have kindly agreed to be mentors for this session.
Would you come to join me on stage, they will introduce what they can help us with?
There is one person on.
Zoom right.
Is that correct?
Will come on Jay is the mash said, I 'm in expert in computer processing of language.
My main focus is head booked for the dialogue with the computers and memorization of language.
So perhaps I can help with the design of approach for computer learning in this area.
That would be my brief introduction answer.
And we are back in the computer linguists from is, well, text analysis, text generation, using tools for translation and so on.
All these things I am too much monsieur.
I can help with computer learning, meaning, recognition and so on.
Lovely.
Thank you to the three of you to alarmmentis for introducing themselves.
Would you kindly take a seat.
After the brief introduction, we can go into the workshop, but about fishing until twelve o 'clock.
So we also invite from the schwarzenegger, develop theater and marking a konzaba both from the theatre, both dramat works to join us on stage.
And without further ado.
Within a few second.
We are starting with the our discussion on talent challenges.
The public zoom session were close.
And you have to know, join our like channel.
If you do not know how to join of, you will find a button which will take you directly to the lake end.
From twelve o 'clock, we go talk about theatre, artificial intelligence.
Because the project that these guys is writing an AI theatre playing.
So please do join us in our discussion, but from the Institute of Poland apply linguistics of the Faculty of mathematics and physics trust University David and from, and will be talking about this?
Do you have to play?
Which is being written by men and computer.
Let us start, I will join you.
And they give a few words of introduction.
That project is a result of, perhaps, of frustration.
Because the 100th anniversary of the work.
The robot which faced appeared on February 25th in the National Theatre.
Ah, when Prague, and then in Haggard 's gallup, actually before that, that was not form or so.
100 years anniversary of the where robot in Houston public has gone by largely unnoticed.
And then these colleagues and, coming from the theater came up with this project, and I did not think it was complete nonsense that a computer could try to about a theater plate than we were joined by colleagues from Ah.
We ask for a grant within the program of Î·, the ground agency.
Oh, Czech Republic supported this project, and this is part of an plight of applied research in human senses.
This is, ah, very actually, a unique project worldwide.
There have been some efforts that a I would help write a screenplay for a movie, maybe a poem or a story and short story.
But this really is a world 's first that had passed the floor to my colleagues.
Now let us do a brief touring test for you and for our audience.
Do not are you on board.
So let me move to the machine.
Could you please tell us what we are doing here.
This is from and experts from it.
The first robot says, So the machines cannot work.
We cannot regenerate machines, robots.
The second robot says, We have more work.
We do not know where to put other than for whom?
Second trumpet for the Next Generation Festival.
Well, we cannot generate robots.
Troubles only give out flesh and blood.
You cannot put blood to bones.
In the second robot.
People know the secret of life.
Do tell us what the secret of life is.
So the machine that we will be talking about today that generates an automatic automatic screenplace of theatres.
We put in some algorithm as a gpus.
And if you are an expert in the field, and then the machine would continue in generating the text.
It picks up here, and you will see two possible continuations, first original by, and the second generated by our machine.
And your town school will be to tell us what is real and what has been real bad written by human in the second written by the machine.
So we now invite the audience to write us whether you believe left on the left side, right on right side.
Which one do you think is the original version and which one is machine produced.
So with a slight composition, Jennifer, what?
Okay, so what is the question?
What has been generated by the machine.
So now, what is the original?
What has been generated by the machine.
Is it the left version, the version of the left.
And and if you think that the machine generated the version in the right column.
Then in check, please write P, said p for the right said.
Column.
So how is this created?
So what is this for years?
And atimentation, what does it mean?
And so from the very south.
We were advanced and we were expecting problems.
Of course, we too, I open I, and they generate what good quality text would be generated them in English.
So what we do we take a model?
We prepare some initial lines.
And with some luck, the model can recognize the format, and it can pick up from that just with a bit of luck, it would stick to the topic.
So the text is actually, the procedure is quite simple, as simple as this.
And how about, as a person from the theater drama took from of the sh of the working here.
What was your reaction.
Well, now you were approached our colleagues with the idea that the will be written as strictly will be written by the air.
My first thought was, Well, I was born in the wrong age.
I will be soon replaced by computer.
But perhaps this can be a useful tool for all this, not only in theatre in the Vietnam.
But I know it is.
A useful tool are for people who read computer games, for example, I am curious, and I have a healthy mixture of curiousness.
And I guess skepticism that much.
What about you?
What were your feelings.
When I guess Rudolf came up with this idea.
Did you say, Well, that is interesting, or, what?
What were your first thought?
Of course, I had.
I felt said, Yeah, that is interesting.
Let us try this sound, and I 'm wondering how far we can go with us.
Now, the question by the When I writing, when I 'm reading about this.
The consensus is the world.
Eating aspects say that a I, although it is called intelligence, it is not intelligent, because it does not understand anything.
How can these ones and zeros make an experience of the world.
They just listen to human clicking on the button.
How can they have something meaningful to say about life and life 's experience.
Well, that is a complex question.
I guess one thing which you mentioned before when we were talking about challenges.
When you call what is intelligence and what is intelligent.
But what is intelligence.
I guess the somehow the definition.
It is a fuzzy business, something we consider intelligent or smart.
For example, chess playing that was considered a complex intellectual activity.
And then we realized we can crack the code, we can reproduce it.
Machine learning and computers can play just.
And maybe I was not such an human achievement, so it can be done quite easily.
So sentence, this was a monster and says that nobody believes it is a purely human domain.
Your question whether the computer can some say?
Some has to say something meaningful.
I do not know, not quite sure.
I do not know whether it can generate something that you did not put in Fest, but you can have a jigsaw.
We would be puzzled of taking some parts structuring them.
And perhaps then we get something interesting.
Well through those systems.
What about humans?
Are humans intelligent?
Because we absorb a lot of things, and then we them.
And then we put out something exists.
Intelligence, what is intelligent?
Eh, yeah, let me jump in.
Since the drummer from the theater.
I think we can learn quite a month about ourselves.
The interesting point for me is that it is free from emotion.
So it is an interesting analytical tool for the computer has learned a lot about us by reading our dialogues by this text and the thing that it put forward would be based on statistics.
So this is what comes up in screenplays most, or play the text.
So very often when two meat.
What would happen.
When we had two characters under a computer generated screenplay, they would have a sexual intercourse.
So it was not over that love as a literary artist would have us believe, or we took about it, but it was all really about coming down to sets.
So that is quite interesting in Europe.
Neural network processes the input you feed it with.
On the other hand, here in the house, moments of great drama and human life.
And well, you come up either with one.
So these extreme, dramatic situations which capture our attention.
Because that is what is quite typical of our image.
Let me go back to the touring test adapted to human dialogue.
These are two columns.
So what were your guess is, could you please reveal was, which one is computer generated.
I cannot see it properly and be happy to do so, but I do not have a good view of the screen.
So let me see.
So the left column is computer generated.
Are you sure?
Did you read it?
Well, did you have a good view of this carrying.
Yes, the other of the slide handler needed a moment that is working was 100 percent confident, but it is that the computer generates it.
Text this on the left and side.
My slack colleagues, could you?
You please check and let us count the boats.
How many of you recognized it correctly.
The touring test revealed that it is quite difficult now to identify computer generated text um from human and painted.
Sources not a question to all of you, do you think, but in the future.
Well, machines.
How can enter to day moving the scene?
I do not know producing guess lightning.
That is machines as well.
And I do not really recall.
I only went to theater as a child.
But what about these and machines or computers.
So does light design, you know?
Can they help in the eight theatre.
What you say, I think the possibilities are there.
But one thing that ah might prevent it.
Is some may be self centeness the rigourism of playwright.
I 'm not quite sure that a playwright would open up to the possibility of computer aiding him Ohio in the work.
So the me watching the computer makes me realize that it is the the part of the accident?
Because you answer is a human.
You do not have a certain degree of probability, your experience, and you kind of go along the same tracks, but the computer can easily break your logical patterns.
So we can come up with some interesting choices.
So if you are faced as an author with some with a crisis in creating something, a new writers block where you are facing, right?
As block computer can help you maybe open up new possibilities.
And Rudolph is saying you as an author.
Perhaps you can, you know, say, okay, that the the the play is not uh may be so intelligent.
It is not our fault, because maybe it wants to tell us something.
So it strips.
You have the responsibility.
You do not have to take all the responsibility as an author very well.
What it could help with is with a quantity, I 'm quite sure, and today plays our something.
Yeah, I 'm wondering whether it could be used for generation of balance.
Not the mother later uh turning to the audience if you have questions.
Slept 2020 with the channel to ask any questions and will collect them.
So you have not five minutes to post your questions.
And we will be back in five minutes and will would respond to them, or rather our guests would respond to them.
So what about thee?
Input the stuff that you feed the network with.
That determines what comes out, right?
What you said that within the first minutes with the first screenplace you had, you had the two main characters engaging in sexual intercourse.
I read something in Mit Technology Review, or one issue that was to be debated is the bias in terms of a I. But the bias, I believe, led to an unsuccessful attempt in the U, K applications.
Africans for universities.
The application being reviewed by a I tools.
I know there was some, some trouble with that.
There was a bias, some other affair, treatment.
So what would be your take on this?
And this much?
Can we regulate this?
Can and shall a human try to rectify this?
Or shall we just leave the play field completely open and let the A I run free.
And not worry about the bias that you determined at the input.
Who love?
Well, AI does not have anything else.
This disposal upon from the input that we feed it with something that was created somewhere, for example, data that is provided by people, by humans.
So a I can not then something.
It just keeps copying.
Ah, it just copies the.
And the the bias that people feed it with.
So it is not good, a bad, it just copies.
And perpetuates what we put in.
So this is something that is, then it is happening.
But there is a lot of research which does you have to make it better.
How to make it even smarter and stricter of the bias.
We can say something about it.
I think it is quite clear.
I do not quite care about the fact that we should try to rectify and improve the situation.
But the issue is technological solutions, how to do it, neural networks.
That is the most advanced thing we have about disposal, but it is very difficult to interpret them.
We do not know clearly, we do not know exactly what is happening to them?
How does the neural network represent the data that we provided with.
And if we decide something about and human.
Some people are discriminated against a group of people.
That is a pattern which will will be rewritten transmitted into the network.
And you can then clearly see it.
And you see that this.
If this group of people does not, ah, make it to the university, and there are not chosen and submitted to the municipality.
Maybe you can write a rectified bit, some quot or a somewhat probability um said of how to get rid of this.
That is a difficult issue.
It is not as easy that you say, Okay, so we see that there is this problem.
I will just not feed in this data, which created the bias.
Because the data is correlated.
It is a living organism.
And we see in research that when you take, for example, C V 's, which they tried to analyze automatically, and you would delete.
Ah, for example, a race identified us, still the Î² would be compromised and the bias would come in there.
How to do this?
How to manipulate the data.
Well, this.
That is a very interesting question to find it, but perhaps will provide us with some hack that will allow artificial intelligence to be prejudice freely.
Bias free those which we have as these living box.
Oh, the flesh and blood, as Karadzic was describing it in his download adventures at the beginning.
Before we take the questions by, let me now ask.
Danny all said at the beginning, then he will start reverses on Mondays on this coming money.
You saw the screenplay already.
Oh, so how cheap?
What would it be like even for actors to deliver the lines which were not written by a human being, but by a computer.
First of all, I think it will be more difficult to learn.
Because there is not always a logical coherence in those sentences.
And one thing which is quite unique and specific to computer technology.
Text is that the computer is somewhat like a child, or is autistic because it does not take into account with work.
Is being said is not true.
It cannot fathom this option.
So in terms of interpretation of the text.
I guess we would try to bring in this intrigue or with this or falsehood.
These things, if we had to interpret it somehow into the fix.
Because what is very often the most interesting thing about the text is that you say something, but actually you mean something different and how to put this meaning, and that will be a challenge.
Okay, let me now keep the questions.
I do not see any question by the audience.
We are virtual audience, nope you have nine more minutes.
We are good for you and our guest king members, not all of them.
We have ah other members from the Or.
Mathematicians, who else is there?
David, representing the world of theodore and others.
I have one more question which has to do with the creative process and with how things work in the theater.
I 'm wondering whether the play in itself, let us say you have the name uh with the whole structure, some nodes.
And the dialogues is all of this created by a eye or a what does the cooperation look like between the human and the computer in display that will be premiered within a month on February 26th.
My guess, human participation will not be more than ten percent as A, but it would be the same with even a a human generative play, because the plain is then structured into several themes and dialogues.
And my input would be, for example, one comment at the beginning.
Introducing the set and thee and the envy and the, and then the rest would be the doubt to be produced by the computer by AI, and then we would stop it, or somehow directed at certain moments where it continued creeping or no.
So that would be a similar approach in my work.
So that is not so different.
What differences? 38 eyed software at the cut on stage can not really give you an arts and overarching story.
So the final screenplay actually puts together the pieces of computer generated dialogue.
So it could only create short pieces of dialogue, which we then put into sequence.
So we would treat the computer as an author, which is very compliant.
And if we senses something that would just fall out of the plate.
I do not know another thing.
There are things where a I can generate something in.
Its contribution is ten percent, 25 percent.
And well, we have had project like this.
That is no longer interesting.
Let us really uh take on AI on board fully.
And we really wanted to keep eyeing put to the middle.
So what governor is saying is very similar.
His cuts into the text, or his involvement with the Texas, very similar as he would have with a human playground.
So although the air project we have currently does not creative of rotting or a very long in air sequence.
We continued with developing the tool that we have.
So we would perhaps first have a structure and overarching design plot, and then create individual dialogues.
And maybe the decision process would be later also transferred to the machine.
Fine.
Should you have questions now is your last chance to ask questions of a slack.
And within five minutes will be starting to to individual topics.
An artificial creative intelligence will be discussed in detail.
Is here interested in the theatre project.
It will premiere in the Shandov Envelope Theatre on February 26 at seven P M, and it will be screened life.
Go to A, T, H, E, A, I T R e dot com.
Most cordially welcome.
This will be the world 's first cover premier.
From what we go from what we know.
No computer generated play full length as ever being created repest and performed in a theater.
There would be a discussion after the play jointly here with her colleagues.
And I believe it will be a unique opportunity to look at where computer generated creativity is at the moment, um?
And it is cooperation also with human creativity.
And I 'm sure it will make for an interesting evening.
Since there are no questions from the audience.
Let me send my thanks to, I guess, and things.
For these 30 minutes talking about eight I, and they attend the creative process.


Let us now go into the part, which hopefully will I make you want to attend the event on February 26,...
