Let me now welcome my colleagues from the UFAL, Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University Prague.
Welcome, Ondřej Dušek, Rudolf Rosa and Tomáš Musil.
They kindly agreed to be mentors for this session.
Would you kindly join me on stage?
They will introduce what they can help us with.
There is one person on Zoom, right?
Is that Ondra?
Correct.
Welcome, Ondřej!
As Tomáš said, I am an expert in computer processing of language.
My main focus is headbot, or the dialogue with the computer and  memorization of language.
So perhaps I can help with the design of approach for computer learning in this area.
That would be my brief introduction, Ondřej.
And were back in the Švandovo divadlo theatre.
Ondřej Dušek.
Yes.
I am an a computer linguist from Charles University as well.
Text analysis, text generation, using tools for translation, and so on.
All of these things.
Hi, I am Tomáš, Tomáš Musil.
I can help with computer learning, meaning, recognition and so on.
Lovely.
Thank you to the three of you, to all our mentors, for introducing themselves.
Would you kindly take a seat?
After their brief introduction, we can right go into the workshop but about session until twelve o'clock.
So we also invite David Košťák from the Švandovo divadlo theatre and Martina Kinská, both from the theatre, both dramaturges to join us on stage.
And without further ado, within a few seconds, we are starting with our discussion on talent challenges.
The public zoom session will close.
And you have to know, join our Robothon slack channel.
If you do not know how to join, over robothon.cz, you will find a button which will take you directly to the link.
And from twelve o'clock, we will talk about theatre, artificial intelligence, because the project of these guys is writing an AI theatre play.
So please do join us.
In our discussion with Rudolf Rosa, Tomáš Musil both from the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.
David Košťák and Martina Kinská from Švandovo divadlo theatre.
And will be talking about this theatre play, which is being written by a man and computer.
It will be premiered here in this theatre on February 26th, this year.
Let start..
I'll join you.
And maybe a few words of introduction.
The project as a result of perhaps a frustration, because the 100th anniversary of the word "Robot", which first appeared on February 25th in the National Theatre in Prague, and then in Hradec Králové, actually before that.
But that was not formal.
So 100 years anniversary of the word "Robot" being used in public has gone by largely unnoticed.
And then these colleagues and colleagues from the theatre came up with this project.
And they did not think it was complete nonsense that a computer could try to write theatre play.
Then we were joined by colleagues from DAMU.
We asked for a grant within the program of ETA.
The Grant Agency of Czech Republic supported this project.
And this is part of an applied, of applied research in human sciences.
This is a very, actually a unique project, worldwide.
There have been some efforts that AI would help write a screenplay for a movie, may be a poem or a story, a short story.
But this really is a world's first.
Let the floor pass to my colleagues now.
Let us do a brief Turing test for you and for our audience.
Rudolf, are you on board?
So let me move to the machine.
Could you please tell us what we are doing here?
This is from Karel Čapek's R.U.R., an extract from his.
The first robot says:
"Sir, the machines cannot work.
We cannot regenerate machines, robots."
The second robot says:
"We have more work. We do not know where to put other than Alquist."
"For whom?"
Second robot:
"For the next generation."
First robot:
"We cannot generate robots, robots only, ah, develop flesh and blood.
You cannot put blood to bones."
The second robot:
"People know the secret of life.
Do tell us what the secret of life is."
So the machine that we will be talking about today that generates an automatic, automatic screen play for theatres.
We put in some algorithms, the GPT2 model, if you are an expert in the field.
And then the machine would continue with generating ah the text.
It picks up here.
And you will see too possible continuations.
First original, by Karel Čapek and the second generated by our machine.
And your task will be to tell us what is real and what has been...
Really written by human, by Karel Čapek and the second written by the machine.
So we now invite the audience to write to us whether you believe left on the left side, right on the right side.
Which one do you think is the original version, and which one is machine-produced.
So with the slack conversation, join us and tell us.
What?
Okay.
So what is the question?
What has been generated by the machine.
So not what is the original.
What has been generated by the machine?
Is it the left version, the version on the left?
Write L.
And if you think that the machine generated the version in the right column, then in Czech, please write P.
So P for the right side column.
So how is this created?
So what is these figures and mathematicians.
What does it mean?
So from the very start we were surprised and we were expecting problems, of course.
We use GPT2 by OpenAI, and they generate like, good quality text.
We were generating them in English.
So what we do?
We take a model, we prepare some initial lines, and, with some luck, the model can recognize the format, and it can pick up from there.
Just with a bit of luck, it would stick to the topic.
So the text...
Actually, the procedure is quite simple, as simple as this.
And how about David?
As a person from the theatre, dramaturge from, of the Švandovo divadlo theature.
Working here, what was, Ah, your reaction, when you were approached by your colleagues with the idea that the dialogues will be written or the script will be written by AI?
My first thought was, well, I was born in the wrong age.
I will be soon replaced by computers.
But perhaps this can be useful too for authors, not only in theatre, in the theatre, but.
But I know it is a useful tool for people who write computer games, for example.
I am curious, and I have a healthy mixture of curiousness and I guess skepticism, not much.
Tomáš, what about you?
What were your feelings when I guess Rudolf came up with this idea?
Did you say, well, that is interesting, or what?
What were your first thought?
Of course, I thought.
I first said:
Yeah, that interesting.
Let us try this out.
And I'm wondering how far we can go with this.
Now, the question by the moderator:
When I'm writing, when I am reading about this, the consensus is:
World leading experts say that AI, although it is called intelligence, it is not intelligent, because it does not understand anything.
How can these ones and zeros make an experience of the world.
They just listen to human clicking on a button.
How can they have something meaningful to say about life and life's experience.
Well, that is a complex question.
I guess one thing which you mentioned before, when we were talking about challenges...
Well, what is intelligence and what is intelligent.
What is intelligence?
I guess the...
Somehow the definition, it's a fuzzy business, something we consider intelligent or smart.
For example, chess playing that was considered a complex intellectual activity.
And then we realized we can crack the code, we can reproduce it.
Machine learning and computers can play chess, and maybe it was not such an human achievement, so it can be done quite easily.
So since this was a milestone, and since then nobody believes it is a purely human domain.
Your question whether the computer can some, say some, has to say something meaningful.
I do not know if...
I'm not quite sure.
I do not know whether it can generate something that you did not put in first.
But you can have a jig-saw, maybe puzzle then.
You know taking some parts, re-structuring them.
And perhaps then we get something interesting.
Well for those who says, what about humans?
Are humans intelligent?
Because we absorb a lot of things, and then we recombine them and we put out something.
Is this intelligence, what his intelligence?
Ah, yeah, let me jump in.
Since the dramaturge from the theatre.
I think we can learn quite a lot about ourselves.
The interesting point for me is that it is free from emotion.
So it is an interesting analytical tool.
So the computer has learned a lot about us by reading our dialogues by this text, and the thing that it put forward would be based on statistics.
So this is what comes up in screenplays most, or play, in the text.
So very often, when two characters meet, they...
What would happen when we had two characters and a computer generated screenplay, they would have sexual intercourse.
So it was not all about love, as a literary artist would have us believe or took about it, but it was all really about coming down to sex.
So this quite interesting.
The neural network processes the input you feed it with.
On the other hand, you have moments of great drama and human life.
And ah, well, you come up either with one or first.
So these extreme dramatic situations which capture our attention.
Because that is what is quite um typical of our day and age.
Let me go back to the Turing test adapted to human dialogue, theature dialogue.
We saw two columns.
So what were your guesses?
So rudolf, could you please reveal?
Which one is computer generated, Rudolf?
I cannot see it properly.
I'd be happy to do so.
But I don't have a good view of the screen.
So let me see.
So the left column is computer generated.
Are you sure?
Did you read it well?
Did you have a good view of the screen?
Yes.
The author of this line had a, needed a moment, as he was not 100% confident that it is...
That the computer generated text is on the left hand side.
My slack colleagues, could you please check and let's count the votes.
How many of you recognized it correctly?
The Turing test revealed that it is quite difficult now to identify a computer generated text from human generated sources.
And now a question to all of you.
Do you think, that in the future, well...
Machines help in theatre today, moving the scene, I don't know producing gas, lightning...
That's machines as well.
And I do not really recall and went to theatre as a child.
But what about these machines or computers?
It's light design, you know.
Can they help, can they aid theatre,
David, what you say?
I think the possibilities are there.
But one thing that, ah, might prevent it, is maybe self-centeredness the rigourism of playwrights.
I'm not quite sure that the playwright would open up to the possibility of computer aiding him or her in her work.
So for me, watching the computer makes me realize that it is the, the power of the accident.
Because you as a human, you really have a certain degree of probability, your experience, and, and you kind of go along the same tracks.
But the computer can easily break your logic, logical patterns.
So it can come up with some interesting choices.
So if you are faced as an author with some, with a crisis in creating something in your writers block...
Where you are facing writers block, computer can help you maybe, open up new possibilities.
And Rudolf is saying:
You as an author.
Perhaps you can, you know.
Say, okay, the, the, the, the play is not maybe so intelligent.
It is not our fault, because maybe it wants to tell us something.
So it strips you of the responsibility.
You do not have to take all the responsibility as an author.
David, when...
What it could help with is a quantity?
I'm quite sure.
If today plays are, auto-generated.
Something yeah...
I'm wondering whether it could be used for generation of the dialogue.
Now the moderator.
Turning to the audience.
If you have questions...
Slack robothon 2020 with the channel, feel free to ask any questions.
And we'll collect them.
So you have enough five minutes to post your questions.
And we will be back in five minutes and will respond to them, or rather, our guests will respond to them.
So what about the input, the stuff that you feed the network with.
That determines what comes out, right?
What you said that within the first minute, with the first screenplays you had, you had the two main characters engaging in sexual intercourse.
I read something in MIT Technology Review.
One issue that has to be debated is the bias in terms of AI.
Bias, I believe, led to an unsuccessful attempt in U.K. applications, applicants for universities, the application being reviewed by AI tools.
I know that there was some, some trouble with that.
There was a bias, some unfair treatment.
So what would be your take on this?
How and inasmuch can we regulate this?
Can and shall a human try to rectify this?
Or shall we just leave the play field completely open?
And let the AI roam freely
And not worry about the bias that you determine at the input.
Rudolf?
Well, AI does not have anything else at its disposal apart from the input that we are feeded with.
Something that was created somewhere, for example, data that is provided by people, by humans.
So AI can learn something, it just keeps copying.
Ah, it just copies the prejudices and the bias that people feed it with.
So it is not good or bad.
It just copies and perpetuates what we put in.
So this is something that is there and is happening.
There is a lot of research which tells you how to make it better.
How to make it even smarter and strip it of the bias.
Tomáš, maybe you can say something about it.
I think it is quite clear.
And I'm quite clear about the fact that we should try to rectify, improve the situation.
But the issue is technological solutions.
How do you do it?
Neural networks, that is the most advanced thing we have at our disposal, but it is very difficult to interpret them.
We don't know clearly.
We do not know exactly what is happening there.
How does the neural network represent the data that we provided with.
And if we decide something about, let us say certain humans.
If some people are discriminated against, a group of people, that is a pattern which will be rewritten, transmitted into the network.
And you can then clearly see it.
And you see that.
This, if this group of people does not...
Ah, make it to the university and they're not chosen and submitted to the event in a city, maybe you can try to rectify it with some quota or a sum of probability.
Um, the setup...
How to get rid of this, that's a difficult issue.
It is not as easy that you say:
Okay, so we see that there is this problem.
I will just not feed in this data, which created the bias, because the data is correlated.
It's a living organism.
And we see in research that when you take, for example, CV's, which they tried to analyze automatically.
And you delete, ah, for example, ah, race identificators.
Still, the data would be compromised
And the bias would come in there.
How to do this?
How to manipulate the data?
Well, that's, that's a very interesting question to ponder.
Well, perhaps hackathon will provide us with some hack that will allow artificial intelligence to be prejudice-free, really bias-free.
Those which we have as these living bulks of flesh and blood, as Karel Čapek was describing it in his dialogue that we introduced at the beginning.
Before we take the questions by the audience, let me now ask David.
Daniel said at the beginning and that he will start rehearsals on Mondays, on this coming Monday.
You saw the screenplay already.
How?
So how she?
What would it be like even for actors to deliver the lines which were not written by a human being, but by a computer?
First of all, I think it will be or difficult to learn, because there is not always a logical coherence in those sentences.
And one thing, which is quite unique and specific to computer-generated text, is that the computer is some what like a child.
Or it is autistic, because it does not take into account with what is being said is not true.
It cannot fathom this option.
So in terms of interpretation of the text, I guess we would try to bring in this intrigue or this falsehood, these things.
If we will have to interpret it somehow into the text because what is very often the most interesting thing about the text is that you say something, but actually you mean something different.
And how to bring this meaning in, that will be a challenge.
Okay, let me now check the questions.
I do not see any question by the audience.
By our, virtual audience.
Nope.
You have nine more minutes.
We are here for you and our guests, team members, not all of them.
We have aah, other members from the, well, mathematicians, psycho-linguists.
Who else is that?
David, representing the world of theatre and others.
I have one more question, which has to do with the creative process and with how things work in the theatre.
I'm wondering whether the play in itself...
Let's say, you have a name, aah, with the whole structure, some notes and the dialogues...
Is all of this created by AI or what does the cooperation look like between the human and the computer it this play that will be premiered within a month on February 26th.
My guess human participation will be more than 10% as dramaturge.
But it would be the same with even a human-generated play.
Because the play is then structured into several scenes and dialogues.
And my input would be, for example, one comment at the beginning, introducing the set and the, and the, and the, and the dialogues.
And then the rest would be the dialogue reproduced by the computer by AI.
And then we would stop it, or somehow direct it at certain moments where it continued creating more dialogue.
So that could be a similar approach in my work.
So that is not so different.
One difference is that the AI, the software at the current stage can not really give you an arch, and overarching story.
So the final screenplay actually puts together the pieces of computer generated dialogue.
So it could only create short pieces of dialogue, which we then put into sequence.
So we would treat the computer as an author, which is very compliant.
And if we, uh, sense or something, it would just fall out of the play.
Rudolf?
A lot of things.
There are things where AI could generate something, and its contribution is 10%, 25%.
And well, we've had a project like this.
That's no longer interesting.
Let's really take on AI on board fully.
And we really wanted to keep our input to the minimum.
So what David is saying is very similar.
His cuts into the text, or his involvement with the text, very similar as he would have with a human playwright.
So although, the AI project we have currently does not create an overarching or a very long linear sequence, we continue with developing the tool that we have.
So we would perhaps first have a structure and overarching design plot, and then create individual dialogues.
And maybe the decision process would be later also transferred to the machine.
Fine, should you have questions now, as your last chance to ask questions over slack.
And within five minutes will be starting our Q&A to individual topics with artificial creative intelligence will be discussed in detail.
If you are interested in the theatre project, it will premiere in the Švandovo divadlo theatre on February 26 at 7 PM, and it will be screened live.
Go to THEAITRE.com.
You're most cordially welcome.
This will be the world's first global premiere.
From what we do, from what we know.
No computer-generated play full length has ever been created or rehearsed and performed in a theatre.
There will be a discussion after the play, jointly here with our colleagues.
And I believe it will be a unique opportunity to look at where computer-generated creativity is at the moment, um, in its corporation, also with human creativity.
And I'm sure it will make for an interesting evening.
Since there are no questions from the audience, let me send my thanks to our guests Rudolf, Tomáš, and David.
Thanks for these 30 minutes talking about AI and theatre, the creative process.
Let us now go into the teaser part, which hopefully will all make you want to attend the event on February 26th.
