# Debate on theAItre at Robothon 2021

This debate was held in Czech, broadcasted and saved by YouTube. We downloaded it from YouTube and sent it via Zoom to our interpreter.

The interpreter knew the topic of the debate but otherwise never saw this video before, simulating live interpretation.

Comments from the interpreter:
- normally, she would know the names of the people in advance
- she would also have the screenplay at hand which the people were reading from the screen
  - (so all support materials for the speakers should be made available to interpreters, too)
- otherwise, it would be similar to a real interpretation task, a rather hard one because:
  - the sound quality was horrible
    - people wearing facemasks, one participant over skype
  - based on the words of the interpreter, the sound quality as transmitted to her was already acceptable
    - this is not quite true if we compare
