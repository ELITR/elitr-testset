Executive summary
I The SME Instrument was set up under the Horizon 2020 research framework
programme to support innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Its
objective is to develop and capitalise on the potential of SMEs by filling the gap in
funding for early stage high-risk projects and increasing private-sector
commercialisation of research results. It is targeted towards innovative SMEs in the EU
and 16 associated countries that show strong ambition to develop, grow and
internationalise in all different types of innovation.
II With an overall budget of €3 billion for the period 2014-2020, the instrument
provides grants to high-potential companies to either support them in developing a
feasibility study (up to €50 000 in Phase 1) or in conducting research and development
and market-testing (€2.5 million in Phase 2). Assistance may also be provided through
coaching, mentoring or other business acceleration services (Phase 3).
III In this audit, we assessed whether the SME Instrument supports innovation by
SMEs. We examined whether it has targeted the right type of SMEs; if it achieved wide
geographic coverage; if the selection process and Commission support were effective,
and if the Commission adequately monitored and followed up the instrument, in order
to make improvements. We expect the observations arising from our audit and the
recommendations we make to feed into the debate on how to set up and administer
the SME instrument’s successor from 2020 onwards.
IV We found that the SME Instrument provides effective support to SMEs in
developing their innovation projects and that having the EU branding that comes from
receiving EU support helps companies to attract additional investment.
V Nevertheless, the instrument’s broad objectives and targets, together with the
changes introduced during the course of its implementation, have caused some
uncertainty for stakeholders. We identified a risk that the instrument funds some
SMEs that could have been financed by the market.
VI Participation in the SME Instrument varies markedly between countries. This is
partly due to external factors but also because of the varying levels of support
provided by National Contact Points and limitations in the Commission’s marketing
and communication activities.
VII We found that improvements have been made to evaluation and selection
procedures during the lifetime of the instrument, with the oral presentation of project
proposals to a panel of jury members being a particularly useful addition in identifying
the best proposals. However, a two-way feedback between the evaluation stages is
missing. In addition, some IT tools are not fit for purpose, thus undermining the
process which is already under pressure.
VIII The resubmission of unsuccessful proposals is a large and increasing drain on
management and evaluation resources without providing added value. Not only does it
increase administrative costs, it also lowers the success rate, thus discouraging
participation.
IX Phase 1 of the instrument provides effective support, thanks to its simple and fast
selection process, the EU branding, and access it gives to business acceleration
services. However, it imposes disproportionately high administrative costs on the
Commission´s administration and its relevance is diminished in countries where similar
programmes already exist.
X Phase 2 of the instrument, which provides a higher level of support with the aim of
bringing the innovation to market, enjoys the same positive outcomes as Phase 1 and
also helps SMEs in raising additional investment.
XI Nevertheless, we found that the majority of beneficiaries still need additional
financing to support their innovative endeavours and bring their projects to market.
The Commission has taken little action to create links between SMEs’ financing needs
and EU-backed financial instruments, and its knowledge of beneficiaries’ financial
needs is limited.
XII Coaching and business acceleration services have the potential to amplify the
effects of the instrument but having been launched late, only a small share of SMEs
made use of the services. Moreover, they have not been sufficiently tailored to the
needs of beneficiaries.
XIII Monitoring of investment raised and company evolution is cost-efficient but it
does not assess the true impact of the instrument. Although beneficiaries have
managed to raise investments in addition to the grants received, imbalances exist
among participating countries, with north-west European SMEs raising more private
funding than those in the south and east of Europe.
XIV In the report, we recommend that the Commission should:
—
improve marketing and communication strategy for the instrument;
—
improve its support to National Contact Points (NCPs) for SMEs and the Enterprise
Europe Network (EEN);refine the instrument selection procedure to make better
use of resources and fund the best proposals;
—
limit the number of times a proposal can be resubmitted and publish the success
rate per project proposal;
—
propose to Member States that the Commission manages schemes similar to
Phase 1;
—
preserve a scheme similar to Phase 2 in the next programming period, building on
the existing results;
—
enhance the business acceleration services by allocating appropriate resources;
and
—
identify and promote synergies between the SME Instrument and EU backed
financial instruments.
Introduction
Importance of SMEs and innovation in the EU economy
According to the European Commission’s Annual Report on SMEs 2017/2018,
SMEs account for 99 % of the companies operating in the EU non-financial business
sector, 66 % of total employment and 57 % of value-added in the EU’s non-financial
business sector.
Both the European Parliament and the Council have stressed the importance of
supporting innovation (particularly breakthrough innovation) and the growth of startups and SMEs. They have noted that support to innovative SMEs and start-ups is
essential in order to maximise Europe’s potential for growth and socio-economic
transformation 1. Academic studies 2, 3 have demonstrated the relationship between
entrepreneurship, SME activity, economic growth and job creation.
The Europe 2020 Strategy4 emphasises the importance of innovation in boosting
growth and employment in the EU. “Innovation Union” is one of the Strategy’s seven
flagship initiatives, aiming “to create an innovation-friendly environment that makes it
easier for great ideas to be turned into products and services that will bring economy
growth and jobs” 5.

Increased focus on SME and innovation in H2020
H2020 is the eighth EU research framework programme. With a budget of
€76.4 billion for the period 2014 to 2020, it ranks as the world’s largest public research
and innovation programme 6.
H2020 has placed greater emphasis on innovation than any of its predecessors,
by providing more funding for testing, prototyping, business-driven R&D and
promoting innovative entrepreneurship. H2020 has also set a more ambitious target in
terms of funds to be allocated to SMEs than any other previous framework
programme: SMEs should receive a minimum of 20 % of the total combined budget of
€9 billion under the pillars “Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies” and
“Societal challenges”.
A budget of €3 billion has been earmarked for the SME instrument (SME-I), which
equates to 33 % of the SME target for the whole H2020 7.
What is the SME Instrument?
The SME-I was set up under the Horizon 2020 (H2020) research framework
programme (FWP) to support innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). It provides grants to high-potential companies to support them in developing a
feasibility study (Phase 1) and in conducting research and development (R&D) and
market-testing (Phase 2). Assistance may also be provided through coaching,
mentoring or other business acceleration services (Phase 3). Available to SMEs in
Member States and countries that have signed association agreements (associated
countries) 8, the SME-I aims to help companies scale up and internationalise.
The SME-I is a novel instrument, since it allows SMEs to participate as single
beneficiaries without necessarily being part of a consortium as usually required by
research framework programmes. It targets projects having reached at least
technology readiness level 6.
Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 establishing H2020.

http://ec.europa.eu/research/bitlys/h2020_associated_countries.html
The objective of the SME-I is to develop and capitalise on the potential of SMEs
by filling the gap in funding for early stage high-risk research and innovation, and
increasing private-sector commercialisation of research results. It is targeted at SMEs
showing a strong ambition to grow and internationalise and shall be provided for all
types of innovation where each activity has a clear European added value.
Responsibility for policy development with respect to the SME-I lies with the
European Commission’s DG Research and Innovation (DG RTD), while implementation
is carried out by the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
(EASME).
The instrument comprises three phases (see Figure 1):
—
Phase 1 (investigation of technical and commercial feasibility of a business
idea): exploring the scientific or technical feasibility and commercial
potential of new ideas. Grants of €50 000 are awarded with a 70 % cofinancing rate from the EU.
—
Phase 2 (development and demonstration): developing innovation for the
purposes of demonstration, performance verification, testing, the
development of pilot lines, validation for market replication, and other
activities aimed at bringing innovation to investment readiness and maturity
for market take-up. Grants of up to €2.5 million can be awarded with a 70 %
co-financing rate.
—
Phase 3 (additional EU support to enter the market): providing support,
training and coaching, as well as facilitating access to risk finance. This phase
consists of a bundle of services offered to beneficiaries in Phases 1 and 2. No
additional grants are awarded in this phase.
Although the different phases are numbered, the SME-I is not sequential: there is
no need to complete Phase 1 in order to participate in Phase 2. The services offered in
Phase 3 may be provided at any point during implementation of the innovation
project, or even after finalisation.

A short history of the SME Instrument
The SME Instrument was launched in 2014, with a design based on the USA’s
SBIR 9 programme. Its “funnel model” would make a large number of low-level
investments in feasibility studies for promising innovation projects (Phase 1), with the
best progressing to Phase 2 and an increased level of funding. However, the obligation
to pass through Phase 1 before Phase 2 was removed at the design phase, allowing
applicants to directly apply to either.
As for other parts of Horizon 2020, the SME Instrument is implemented via work
programmes, which cover periods of two or three years, and with each work
programme, the characteristics of the instrument can be modified according to policy
intentions.
The 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 work programmes divided the SME-I budget into
thematic topics e.g. biotechnology, health, security. SMEs would apply to the topic,
which fitted their project best.
https://www.sbir.gov/about/about-sbir.
The 2018-2020 work programme featured a “European Innovation Council (EIC)
Pilot” which grouped the SME-I together with certain other programmes – Future
Emerging Technologies Open (FET Open), Fast Track to Innovation (FTI) and H2020
Prizes. The main changes introduced under the EIC Pilot affecting the SME-I were:
o
a bottom-up approach in an open call without needing to apply to a thematic
topic;
o
a “pitch” by SMEs for selection in Phase 2: face-to-face interviews with a panel of
experienced innovators;
o
increased mentoring and coaching opportunities for all beneficiaries through
Phase 3.
In June 2018, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation establishing
Horizon Europe post-2020 10. The proposal envisages an EIC as the third pillar in a
framework programme with a budget of €10.5 billion that would “combine all EU
support to breakthrough and market-creating innovation in one place” and comprise
two instruments: the Pathfinder for Advanced Research and the Accelerator.
Therefore, the previous Phase 1 would definitively be discontinued while actions
similar to those in the previous Phases 2 and 3 would be included in the Accelerator 11.
COM(2018) 435, Proposal for a Regulation establishing Horizon Europe, June 2018.
In April 2019 the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council reached a
provisional general agreement on Horizon Europe.
In March 2019, the Commission modified the work programme and launched the
“Enhanced EIC Pilot” to run from June 2019 to the end of 2020. The Enhanced EIC Pilot
represents a transition towards the proposed EIC under Horizon Europe (post-2020),
forging a closer relationship between the constituent parts and bringing significant
changes to the SME-I. Phase 1 was discontinued and the following instruments were
introduced:
o
the “Pathfinder”, replacing the former FET-Open and FET-Proactive;
o
the “Accelerator”, replacing the previous Phase 2:
—
development and scaling-up of high-risk innovation by SMEs;
—
introduction of the non-bankability concept 12;
—
grants of up to €2.5 million; and
—
option for equity injection of up to €15 million (blended finance).
The EIC Pilot represented an evolution of the SME-I, mostly in line with its original
design, while the Enhanced EIC Pilot introduced changes facilitating a transition
towards the proposed EIC under Horizon Europe. The SME-I is the largest element in
both the EIC Pilot and EIC Enhanced Pilot, accounting for around two-thirds of the
respective budgets.
The proposal for the EIC under Horizon Europe, currently in legislative procedure,
preserves some elements of the instrument such as a continued focus on SMEs and
grant-only support. However, certain other aspects under consideration have yet to be
developed or tested 13.
The concept of non-bankability is defined in the EIC frequent asked questions as an
“inability to attract sufficient funding”.
For example, the provision of financial support to projects through equity finance, and the
partial acceptance of the selection processes carried out in other calls or programmes.
Audit scope and approach
This special report is the latest in a series of ECA publications examining financial
support to innovative SMEs 14. Both the European Parliament and the Council have
stressed the importance of supporting innovative SMEs and start-ups in order to
maximise Europe’s potential for growth. We expect the observations arising from our
audit and the recommendations we make to feed into the multiannual financial
framework debate on how to set up and administer the SME instrument’s successor
from 2020 onwards.
In this audit, we examined whether the SME Instrument was effective in
supporting innovation by SMEs?
The audit addressed whether:
o
the instrument targeted the “right SMEs”(i.e., those with high innovation
potential);
o
the instrument achieved geographical reach as well as searching for excellence;
o
the Commission’s selection process was designed to fund the best projects;
o
the Commission provided effective support to beneficiaries;
o
the Commission adequately monitored and followed up the instrument in order
to make improvements.
Our audit therefore focused on the design, management and outputs of the SME-
I and its evolution towards the EIC including the EIC Pilot. We included in our audit the
grants awarded in the period January 2014 to May 2019.
Special reports on guarantees (SR 20/2017 SME Guarantee Facility) and on venture capital
(SR 17/2019).
The audit combined evidence from a range of sources:
o
a desk review of documents;
o
an analytical data review;
o
surveys of beneficiaries, unsuccessful applicants receiving a seal of excellence,
remote evaluators and national innovation agencies (NIAs);
o
information visits to Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and the
United Kingdom; and
o
interviews with Commission Directorates-General, EASME, the European
Investment Bank (EIB), European Investment Fund (EIF) and other relevant
stakeholders.
For further details on our audit methodology and sources of evidence, see
Annex I.
Observations
Targeting the right beneficiaries
According to the H2020 Regulation15, the SME-I targets innovative SMEs with a
strong ambition to develop, grow and internationalise.
Objectives and target group of the SME Instrument have changed during
its implementation
SME-I stakeholders pointed out in interviews and in response to our surveys that
the SME-I would have benefited from a more precise definition of its target and
objectives at its inception.
This ambiguity, particularly concerning the type of companies being targeted by
the SME-I, was also highlighted in the SME Experts Advisory Group (EAG) 2014
Report 16. According to the EAG, additional resources and a deeper analysis of the
intended target group would have allowed the Commission greater confidence in
attracting the right type of applicants.
The objectives in successive work programmes changed several times throughout
implementation. The first two work programmes (2014-2015 and 2016-2017) focused
on any innovation that boosted company growth and was new to the market. The
work programmes for the EIC Pilot (2018-2020) and the Enhanced EIC Pilot (20192020) shifted focus towards “market-creating” innovation. By comparison, the SBIR
programme has changed little since its renewal in 2011 17.
The frequent changes introduced during the short life of the SME-I has led to
confusion for key actors, such as the National Contact Points (NCPs), the Enterprise
Europe Network (EEN) and applicants about what should be funded.
Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 establishing H2020.
Annual Report of the EAG on Innovation in SMEs.
https://sbir.nih.gov/reauthorization#eligibilityDiv
During implementation of the SME-I, the type of companies targeted has shifted
from mature companies that had participated in previous FWPs, to innovative and in
particular, young companies without previous FWP experience. The introduction in
of the bottom-up approach and the pitch under the EIC Pilot accelerated the
move towards a more youthful mix of SMEs (see Figure 2).

The current age profile of beneficiaries matches that of companies identified in
the Nesta study18 on the factors for growth and differences in job creation for
companies. This indicates that the current portfolio of beneficiaries is better
positioned to deliver growth and job creation.
The bottom-up approach has solved the issue seen with the previous structure
where companies would select the "topic" on which to apply for support, based on the
different award success rates. It has also simplified the administrative procedures for
the calls. An alternative approach may be appropriate where there is a need to ringfence specific areas considered a priority for the EU.
Nesta Working Paper No 11/02, A look at business growth and contraction in Europe.
Late introduction of non-bankability concept
The SME-I aims to “fill the gap in funding for early stage high-risk research and
innovation” 19. However, the successive work programmes have not specified how to
target SMEs facing difficulties in obtaining funding from other sources, and the
concept of “non-bankability” was only introduced with the Enhanced EIC Pilot in 2019.
According to various stakeholders interviewed, there is a risk of the SME-I
crowding-out private investment. This was borne out in the results of our survey
among beneficiaries. In Phase 2, 36 % of respondents believed that their projects could
have received funding from the private sector, and 17 % replied that they could have
used their company's own resources to fund innovation. Jury members also confirmed
this risk in interview (see Figure 3).

However, the stakeholders highlighted the subsequent crowding-in effect
generated by the EU grant that helps beneficiaries to later attract the additional funds
needed to advance their innovation projects and scale up.
The bankability of a project is a complex concept determined by several variables,
such as volume of funds needed, timing and price. Given its complexity, most
interviewees believed there was a need to define what bankability meant and how it
should be measured.
Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 establishing H2020.
Prior to 2019, the bankability of projects was not considered in the SME-I
selection process. Indeed the instrument awarded grants to some SMEs that could
have been financed by the market. The introduction of the non-bankability concept
requires clear provisions on how it can be demonstrated, particularly since the EU
branding of the SME-I and the grant itself attract additional financial resources
supporting beneficiaries’ innovation projects.
Geographical reach
Varying levels of participation among countries – partly due to factors
beyond the control of the Commission
The main factor determining SME-I participation and project success is
excellence. Therefore, given the contrasting innovation levels among Member States,
an uneven distribution of funds is to be expected. At the same time, however, through
H2020 the EU aims to ensure that the benefits of an innovation-led economy are
widely distributed and maximised 20.
The graphs and maps below (Figure 4, Picture 1 and Picture 2) illustrate countrylevel statistics on the number of submitted applications and funding received relative
to the number of SMEs, GDP and population. Annex II shows the distribution of SME-I
funding per Member State in absolute and relative terms, the number of projects
awarded, the number of proposals and the success rate per Member State.
Traditionally, Horizon 2020 implementation analysis has featured two different
groups of Member States: EU-15 and EU-13 21. In the case of the SME Instrument, this
distinction does not serve to explain the variation in funding received (see first column
of Figure 4).

EU-13 Member States are meant as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, whereas EU-15 countries
are the other 15 Member States of the European Union.

The level of participation in SME-I and project success rate are affected by several
factors:
innovation ecosystem and number of SMEs in the country;
existence of a national strategy on the SME-I;
effort made to promote the SME-I; and
support provided by NCPs and the EEN.
While some of these factors are beyond the Commission’s control, others – such
as the marketing and promotion of the instrument or the support provided by the
NCPs – fall within its influence.
Differences in success rates between countries are partly explained by existing
variation in the levels of innovation. Figure 5 shows a strong correlation between
success rates in the SME-I and the European Innovation Scoreboard Summary
Innovation Index 22.

A common characteristic of participant countries with high participation and
success rates in the instrument is the presence of an active national innovation agency
(NIA), which acts as intermediary with the innovative SMEs. Conversely, in the three
Member States with the lowest level of participation (compared to the number of
SMEs in the country) and the lowest success rates, there is no NIA.
In our survey of national innovation agencies (NIAs), we asked whether they had
national programmes supporting SMEs in applying for the SME-I. Just under half of
NIAs confirmed that they had national programmes supporting SMEs applying for
Phase 2, with 35 % reporting this for Phase 1 (see Figure 6). Interviewees noted that
since the SME-I instrument was created, some national agencies had scaled down
similar programmes and instead prepared their companies for SME-I.

Spain is a good example of a Member State with a national strategy supporting
innovative companies that could be eligible for the SME-I. The Spanish authorities have
set up a system to market the SME-I, actively searching for highly innovative
companies and supporting them in applying for the instrument. Spain is the greatest
beneficiary of the SME-I: it receives some 20 % of the total budget and has the highest
number of applicant SMEs. Despite being a moderate innovator according to the
European Innovation Scoreboard, it has one of the highest success rates. Ireland and
Denmark also actively promote the instrument and prepare their SMEs for
participation.
In Member States visited with a low level of participation in the SME-I (in terms of
funds awarded and success rate), awareness of the SME-I was limited. There was little
specific support or promotion at national level or guidance for companies regarding
the instrument. In turn, low success rates have discouraged other companies from
applying to the SME-I. Moreover, the existence of alternative national programmes,
which return higher success rates, has reduced the attractiveness of the SME-I for
companies and auxiliary agents such as consultants.
Awareness affected by the absence of a targeted marketing and
communication strategy at Commission level
The SME-I represents a new form of support in the FWPs, targeting mainly single
SMEs with highly innovative projects, with a market-driven approach.
The traditional types of H2020 applicant (universities, large corporations and
research centres) is familiar with the funding opportunities offered by H2020. These
organisations have experience with both H2020 and previous FWPs and, in many
cases, have dedicated staff managing applications and projects. The type of companies
targeted by the SME-I generally have not participated in previous FWPs and may not
even have included public funds in their finance strategy.
We examined whether SME-I was promoted, implemented and monitored to
provide easy access to the instrument for SMEs as set out in Council
Decision 743/2013. We also looked at the extent to which marketing techniques were
used to make the right companies aware that this funding opportunity exists and
appropriate channels of communication must be identified and used to reach them.
The Commission and EASME had a limited budget to launch communication
activities and organise various events gathering potential beneficiaries of the SME-I,
mainly H2020 information days. Reports published by the EAG highlighted the absence
of a marketing strategy for the SME-I, and the need to identify the right “clients” and
adjust communication channels and tools accordingly. The SME-I evaluation 23 saw this
as a possible explanation for varying penetration rates in the EU-28 countries, and
pointed to the need to re-examine the communication and marketing strategy.
“Evaluation of the SME instrument and the activities under Horizon 2020 Work Programme
Innovation in SMEs”, February 2017.
Despite the efforts made to reach potential beneficiaries, the Commission did
not have a structured marketing and communication strategy. It did not employ a
sufficiently targeted approach to raise awareness among innovative SMEs of the
funding opportunities offered by the SME-I.
The Commission relies heavily on the promotion done at national level by the
NCPs and the EEN to achieve uniform implementation of the SME-I. It considers the
NCPs to be “the main structure for providing practical information and assistance to
potential participants”. As SMEs are less familiar with H2020 than other participants in
the FWP (see paragraph 51), the role of the NCPs is particularly important for SMEs.
The NCPs are appointed and paid by the national authorities. They are responsible for
ensuring that “the new programme becomes known and readily accessible to all
potential applicants” 24. However, as stated in the ECA special report 28/2018 25, the
level of support offered by the NCPs varies among Member States. In some, they act as
full-time NCPs; in others, they have to combine NCP tasks with other responsibilities.
The level of support provided by the NCPs varies across Member States,
influencing the level of participation and success rates. In only two of the six Member
States visited were the NCPs fully dedicated to the role. The NCPs in two Member
States held proposal-writing workshops and pre-screened applications. One organised
mock jury pitches. Others did little, aside from hosting H2020 information days.
The NCPs and EEN reported that the SME-I had been promoted mainly at national
level with limited support from the European Commission, as the programme does not
allocate the NCPs a specific budget for dissemination activities.
http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/support/ncp/h2020-standardsprinciples_en.pdf.
Special report 28/2018 The majority of simplification measures brought into Horizon 2020
have made life easier for beneficiaries, but opportunities to improve still exist.
Access4SMEs is an H2020 coordination and support action aiming to “facilitate
transnational cooperation among NCPs for SMEs and access to risk finance, upgrade
their skills and tools in order to raise their standard of support” 26. Interviewees stated
that Access4SMEs has been the main source of information on the SME-I for the NCPs,
EENs and beneficiaries. However, the network was only set up in September 2016
– almost three years after the launch of the instrument – and so was not in place when
its services would have been the most valuable.
Selection of projects
An effective selection procedure is critical to ensuring that the best applications
are chosen for funding. In view of this, the selection procedure should have sufficient
resources and assign the appropriate type of experts to each stage of the evaluation.
The SME Instrument is based on a continuously open call for proposals, with four
cut-off dates per phase per year. The evaluation process is carried out remotely by
four independent evaluators per proposal. Since 2018, the selection procedure for
Phase 2 grants has included a presentation of the projects to a jury, which is a second
stage of evaluation conducted by a panel of six experts, mostly investors.
Limited resources for evaluation and remote evaluation procedure
overloaded by high number of submissions
EASME receives and manages a very high number of proposals at each of the four
cut-off dates per year for each of the two phases. At the last cut-off date for 2018, it
received more than 1800 applications for Phase 2 and 2200 for Phase 1.
The evaluation process is challenged by a combination of limited resources and a
high number of submissions. Evaluators have only 1.6 hours in Phase 1 and 2.4 hours
in Phase 2 to complete the evaluation and its documentation, although applications
are lengthy (10 pages excluding annexes for Phase 1 and 30 pages excluding annexes
for Phase 2).
http://www.access4smes.eu/project/#_goal
In our survey, only 34 % of Phase 2 evaluators responded that the 2.4 hours
allocated by the Commission to evaluate the proposals was sufficient. The average
time needed was 5.1 hours. For Phase 1, 56 % of respondents were satisfied, requiring
three hours instead of 1.6 hours allocated by the Commission (see Figure 7).

The evaluators replying to our survey were mostly satisfied with the guidance and
training provided, though they would like to receive feedback on their evaluations and
statistics of outcomes, enabling them to benchmark and improve their performance.
They expressed concern about the training for new evaluators and the consequent
variability in their scoring. Statistics from EASME confirm this variability and H2020
rules require that 25 % of evaluators are newcomers.
Presentation to jury largely improves the selection procedure while
complying with time-to-grant
The introduction of the presentation of projects to a jury in 2018 was a positive
change, since it compensates for the weaknesses inherent in a remote evaluation and
allows for the verification of the practicality of the project and the potential of the
team to implement it. Nevertheless, certain elements remain sub-optimal.
The jury members assess 20 presentation of projects during an evaluation week
and are expected to read the documents submitted by applicants in advance.
However, the jury members we interviewed felt that they did not receive the
documents sufficiently in advance to review potentially 1 600 pages of application
information.
They also suggested having access to the comments from the remote evaluators’
reports. In doing so, useful knowledge would be retained, thereby improving
efficiency, given the limited time available for preparing and discussing the
presentation of projects to the juries. Similarly, evaluators considered that the quality
of their evaluations would be improved if they received the jury members’ comments
on the proposals they had evaluated.
No systematic due diligence is currently performed on applications reaching the
presentation stage. Jury members indicated the need for a “light” due diligence
process to verify the accuracy of the information provided by applicants on patents,
company profile and team composition.
The Commission set the time-to-grant (time between the cut-off date and the
signature of the grant agreement) target at a maximum of three months for Phase 1
and six months for Phase 2. Actual time-to-grant has decreased since the start of the
programme and despite the introduction of the presentation to juries in 2018, in that
year EASME signed 90 % of the grants within the target time.
Some IT tools pose risks for the evaluation process
Applicants submit proposals online via the electronic proposal submission system
on the H2020 Participant Portal.
To arrange presentations of projects and compose juries with suitable skills,
EASME uses a spreadsheet workbook, which is vulnerable to breakdown that could
cause delays and jeopardise an evaluation procedure.
Since there are no dedicated IT tools to reimburse applicants for their
participation in the pitch, they are registered as evaluators in the internal expert
management system (EMI). Consequently, there is a risk that they could accidentally
be contacted for the purpose of evaluating proposals.
In addition, changes in the selection process introduced in September 2019 under
the Enhanced EIC pilot (request for financial data from participants and technology
readiness level information) require bolt-on solutions that have not yet been
developed.
Resubmission of proposals straining evaluation resources
There is no limit to the number of times that an unsuccessful application can be
resubmitted to the SME-I. At evaluation, a resubmitted proposal receives the same
treatment as any other initial application, with no information from previous
evaluations being carried forward.
The additional cost to the applicant of resubmitting an unchanged proposal is
negligible. The number of resubmitted applications has been steadily increasing and
now forms a sizeable proportion of total submissions. For the latest 2018 Phase 2 cutoffs (see Figure 8), 66 % of applications were resubmissions, with half of these
appearing for at least the third time.

The increase of applications over time is only due to the resubmissions. The
number of new projects applying for Phase 2 has remained stable at 500 applications
per cut-off (see Figure 9).

Resubmissions place a significant and increasing strain on evaluation resources.
Between 2015 and 2018, the cost of evaluating proposals on their third and
subsequent resubmission – considering only remote expert evaluators’ fees – was over
€4.3 million (including more than €1.8 million in 2018).
The H2020 mid-term evaluation suggested that oversubscription discouraged
participation, impaired the quality of evaluations, was a drain on resources and left a
number of high-quality proposals unfunded.
The average success rate for SME-I submissions is 4.7 % in Phase 2 and 8.6 % in
Phase 1. However, if we calculate the success rate per project proposal rather than per
submission, around 11.5 % of Phase 2 and 16.6 % of Phase 1 proposals are ultimately
successful.
Effectiveness of support in the SME Instrument phases
Support provided by the SME-I should be timely and relevant and meet the needs
of innovative SMEs.
Phase 1 provides useful support to SMEs but similar schemes already
exist in some Member States
According to interviewed stakeholders, Phase 1 and Phase 2 have effectively
become two different programmes. Phase 1 helps companies with no public funding
experience, such as small IT companies or start-ups; Phase 2 is more complex, which
means the type of companies applying for Phase 1 find applying for Phase 2 a
challenge.
The difference in success rates between companies passing through Phase 1
before applying to Phase 2 and companies applying directly to Phase 2 has been
narrowing throughout SME-I implementation. However, the Phase 2 success rate is still
% higher for companies passing through Phase 1 than for companies applying
directly to Phase 2 (see Figure 10).

Phase 2 beneficiaries that had passed through Phase 1 indicated that the first
phase had provided good preparation, helping them to improve the project.
Stakeholders interviewed in some Member States believed that Phase 1 projects
could often be carried out just as well at national level, although this would be a
challenge in some Member States.
In our survey of the NIAs, 48 % of respondents declared that their Member State
had national programmes similar to Phase 1. When asked about the main strengths of
SME-I Phase 1 compared with national programmes, the NIAs cited the fast and
transparent selection procedure, the credibility conferred by the EU label, and access
to coaching and business acceleration services. In addition, they praised the critical
mass of innovative companies that had been set up thanks to SME-I Phase 1, which
had managed to attract many innovative companies to the EU programme.
When asked for their views on continuing Phase 1 under the new FWP, 86 % of
NIA respondents considered that Phase 1 should be preserved under the new FWP
(see Box 1 for examples of opinions of NIAs on whether to continue with funding for
Phase 1). Those in favour of continuing Phase 1, indicated that the business
acceleration and coaching services had increased these companies’ capacity to handle
innovation activities in a professional way, allowing them to scale up and grow. They
suggested that the European nature of the call for proposals spurred SMEs to raise
their level of ambition from the early development stages, and that the simple and fast
evaluation process had no equivalent at national level. Those against continuing
Phase 1, (14 %) noted the absence of added value over national/regional instruments
and the absence of a significant link between Phases 1 and 2.
Box 1
National Innovation Agencies opinions on Phase 1
—
“Phase 1 has been an excellent entry point to Horizon 2020 for SMEs with no
prior experience of European or International programmes for R&I. The
mentoring and coaching activities provided by EEN to SME I beneficiaries
have increased these companies’ capacity to handle innovation activities in a
professional way, allowing them to scale and grow.”
—
“Phase 1 has enabled SMEs to take one step further. SMEs themselves often
lack knowledge and resources to make exhaustive IP, market and
competition surveys, etc. After finalisation of the Phase 1 project, they are
also well prepared, not only to apply for Phase 2 funding but also for other
funding resources/capital. The grant received from the EC is also kind of a
trust and quality label.”
—
“Phase 1 is valuable, but does not add the most benefit. Rather it is important
that MSs/Associated Countries also invest themselves, so that small-scale
interventions such as this could be left to national/regional agencies.
However, not all MSs are equipped at present to deliver such support.”
—
“Phase 1 provides no additionality; any MS can set up a similar programme.”
Phase 1 imposes an excessive burden on SME Instrument administration
Since the launch of the SME-I, 3 978 Phase 1 grant agreements have been signed.
The process from start to finish requires a considerable administrative effort in terms
of evaluation, grant preparation, grant signature and coaching services. Four project
officers manage around 1 000 projects per year. Project monitoring is therefore limited
to administrative checks, without an assessment of the quality of the feasibility study.
Table 1 compares the costs of remote evaluation per phase with the overall
amount granted. It highlights a large difference in the costs of each phase, with the
relative evaluation costs being ten times greater (per euro granted) in Phase 1 than in
Phase 2. The benchmark for the cost of evaluation in the private venture capital sector
is 3 %.

Despite the greater administrative overhead incurred for Phase 1 compared to
Phase 2, Phase 1 provides effective support, thanks to the fast selection process at EU
level, the EU label for beneficiaries and the access to the BAS. In addition, it has
attracted many innovative companies to the EU programme. However, in countries
where similar programmes to Phase 1 already exist, its relevance is diminished.
The Commission has discontinued Phase 1 from September 2019.
Phase 2 provides effective support to SMEs
Interviewed stakeholders (representatives from the NIAs and NCPs, innovation
experts, evaluators, jury members, the EEN, SME umbrella organisations and
beneficiaries) were unanimous in their endorsement of Phase 2 on account of its many
positive elements, such as:
—
the intensity of financial support at a high technology readiness level that
Member States cannot provide 27;
—
competition among SMEs at EU level;
—
attraction of additional investment through association with the EU brand (see
paragraphs 119 and 121);
—
availability of coaching and business acceleration services;
—
simple and fast selection and award processes compared to national schemes;
and
—
focus on the “go-to-market” strategy of the projects, in which projects develop an
action plan specifying how the SME will reach customers and achieve competitive
advantage.
In our survey to the NIAs, we asked whether they thought that SME-I Phase 2
should continue under Horizon Europe and why (see Box 2 for examples of opinions of
NIAs on whether to continue with funding for Phase 2). All respondents said that it
should continue.

Box 2
National Innovation Agencies opinions on Phase 2
—
It offers something different from what is available at the national level; in
addition, it facilitates the creation of international networks. Coaching is also
important.
—
It is a great instrument that is easy to understand for the applicants.
—
It is an important and unique programme to support growing SMEs in the
pilot phase.
—
The success and popularity of the scheme amongst SMEs has proved that it
has a very suitable setup for SMEs. The changes made during the
implementation period (especially interviews) have raised the value of the
scheme.
When asked if significant changes should be made to the design of the SME-I,
% replied “no”, 16 % indicated limited changes and only 11 % more profound
changes. This suggests that Phase 2’s current form is generally well appreciated.
Phase 2 of the SME-I provides effective support to beneficiaries. It provides EU
branding that gives visibility to the companies and projects, helps them to raise
additional investment, and allows access to the EU network of coaching and BAS.
Phase 2 enjoys a very high appreciation in its current form among surveyed NIAs. This
opinion is shared by all stakeholders interviewed.
Phase 3 business acceleration services have potential but were launched
late
The coaching and business acceleration services (Phase 3) play a key role in the
overall setup of the SME-I, as they should respond to SMEs’ innovation needs through
tailor-made support, competence development and networking. According to a study
published by the University of Manchester, there is “a far greater level of success for
firms (particularly small firms) in measures that combine direct and indirect support” 28.
“The Impact of Direct Support to R&D and Innovation in Firms”, Compendium of Evidence
on the Effectiveness of Innovation Policy Intervention, August 2012.
Coaching covers a broad range of topics, notably: business development,
organisational development, cooperation and financing. Phase 1 beneficiaries receive
three days’ coaching and Phase 2 beneficiaries receive 12. The SME-I has led to the setup of the first European network of coaches to support beneficiaries.
Business acceleration services are open to both Phase 1 and Phase 2 beneficiaries
and include participation in:
—
trade fairs and conferences;
—
corporate days;
—
investors’ events;
—
the EIC Innovators' summit;
—
mentoring;
—
the EIC Community Platform;
—
an investors' matching tool;
—
the EIC Academy.
Phase 3 events and other business acceleration services have focused primarily
on putting SMEs in contact with potential investors or business partners. EASME has
done little to help beneficiaries in reaching out to potential customers (both large
private corporates and public bodies through innovative public procurement).
SME beneficiaries responding to our survey very much appreciated both the
coaching scheme and any business acceleration services that they had used (see
Figure 11). This positive opinion was confirmed by our visits to beneficiaries and the
surveyed NIAs. Nevertheless, the NIAs and EEN nodes suggested that EASME could:
—
better coordinate the organisation of events with local players (NIAs and EEN
nodes);
—
better target the marketing of business acceleration services to avoid emailing
SMEs about events that were not relevant to them;
—
explore opportunities to collaborate with national promotional institutions that
could provide investment opportunities to SME-I beneficiaries.

Interviewed innovation experts take the view that business acceleration
services should stimulate the demand-side through matching SMEs with potential
large business customers and supporting their participation in innovative public
procurement schemes.
In comparison, Phase 3 of the SBIR programme is oriented towards public
procurement. In the United States, federal agencies with annual R&D budgets
exceeding $100 million are required to allocate 3.2 % to beneficiaries of the SBIR
programme in the form of public procurement. In 2015, the contracts signed between
US federal agencies and SBIR beneficiaries amounted to $1.3 billion, while grants
overall were worth $1.2 billion 29.
SBA Office of Investment & Innovation on SBIR, December 2016.
The importance of public procurement for innovation for SMEs and start-ups is
recognised by the Commission in its Guidance on Innovation Procurement 30. In this
document it indicates that “by acting as a lead customer, public buyers can provide
innovative companies with an opportunity to test their new solutions under real-life
conditions. Moreover, by becoming their customer and thus increasing their turnover,
contracting authorities might encourage other investors – both public and private – to
invest in their activities”. However, at present, the Commission has not included any
innovative public procurement schemes among the business acceleration services to
link the SME-I beneficiaries to EU agencies or national institutions.
Uptake of the various business acceleration services has been low, with
attendance among the surveyed beneficiaries ranging from 12 % at the EIC Academy to
% at trade fairs and conferences (see Figure 12). This is partly explained by the fact
that some services only started at the end of 2017, almost four years after the launch
of the instrument.

Effectiveness of the SME Instrument not assessed and its future role in
Horizon Europe is still to be determined
In order to provide timely input to the drafting of the new regulation, the
Commission performed several evaluations in the early years of the SME-I – despite
the lack of mature data (see Figure 13) – such as:
—
the mid-term evaluation of the SME-I published in February 2017, by which point,
no Phase 2 innovation project had yet been completed;
—
the H2020 mid-term evaluation published in May 2017, affected by the same
constraints as in the point above;
—
the Horizon Europe Impact Assessment published in June 2018. Only around
companies had at this point completed their Phase 2 innovation projects.
Furthermore, it normally takes a few years to see the real impact of the
innovation project.

Due to the novelty of the programme and the absence of any previous track
record, the SME-I was evaluated purely on the basis of inputs and completed Phase 1
projects, and not on the basis of results from Phase 2 projects. Consultations
conducted and independent reports produced for the design of the EIC under Horizon
Europe (see Annex II) were similarly affected. Therefore, the Commission could not
base the design of the EIC under Horizon Europe on a comprehensive analysis of the
SME-I’s implementation, achieved results and impact.
Attracting investment after SME Instrument funding
One of the SME-I’s objectives is to facilitate access to private capital and create
links to EU-backed financial instruments31. According to Council Decision 743/2013,
“links to the financial instruments  are foreseen, for example, by giving SMEs that
have successfully completed phases 1 and/or 2, priority within a ring-fenced volume of
financial resources”.
Commission has only limited knowledge of beneficiaries´ overall
financing needs and has not made link to EU financial instruments
EASME does not systematically collect information on Phase 2 beneficiaries’
additional financial needs for full development of their projects. EASME last carried out
a survey in 2016 to assess these needs but posed no questions on the preferred source
or intended use of funding.
In 2018, DG RTD asked the EIB to produce a study on access to finance for
SME-I beneficiaries, which was then used to support the Horizon Europe Impact
Assessment 32. The EIB based the report on prior assessments and on a survey
conducted on a sample of beneficiaries. However, the sample was not representative
and only 24 beneficiaries responded to the survey. Consequently, the report provides
only limited insight into the actual financial needs of SME-I beneficiaries.
Our representative survey (see Annex I) provided some indication of the
financial needs of Phase 2 beneficiaries. In particular:
—
three quarters of respondents said they needed additional financing of an
average of €7.1 million;
—
% of respondents seeking additional financing expressed an interest in private
venture capital investment, while 48 % were open to debt instruments such as
loans or credit lines.
The type of financing sought varies according to company maturity with young
SMEs more interested in equity injections than older ones (see Figure 14).

The majority of SME-I beneficiaries would need additional financing to support
their innovation endeavours and bring their innovation projects to market. However,
the Commission’s knowledge of beneficiaries’ financial needs is limited.
Under the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, the EU launched a large
range of financial instruments to support innovation by SMEs33. However, 64 % of
beneficiary survey respondents were not aware of these instruments.
The EIB report on access to finance for beneficiaries of the SME-I34 drew the
following conclusions, which were confirmed through our survey and interviews with
beneficiaries:
—
There is a funding gap for SME-I beneficiaries when projects exit Phase 2.
—
Grants provide a positive market signal to private capital providers.
—
Available information on financial instruments is fragmented and communication
between private and public capital providers is limited.
Among others: “Access to risk finance initiative” (InnovFin) under H2020; “Access to finance
for SMEs” (COSME); European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).
EIB-Innovfin Advisory Group: “Improving Access to Finance for Beneficiaries of the SME-I”
(March 2018).
An EAG report35 in 2016, pointed to the lack of synergies between different EU
financial interventions and the need for the SME-I to coordinate with other public
investors, to better meet projects’ demands for funds following Phase 2 completion.
We analysed the list of beneficiaries of EU-backed venture capital managed by
the EIB and the EIF and found that, by the end of 2018, only 16 SME-I beneficiaries
(eight of which were Phase 2) had received such financial support. In five cases, the
financial instrument’s investment occurred before the SME-I grant had been awarded.
One of the SME-I’s aims since inception has been to create links with EU-
backed financial instruments. However, the Commission has taken very little action to
this end: it did not ring-fence any funds for SME-I beneficiaries and beneficiaries have
limited awareness of the EU-backed financial instruments.
H2020 EAG, Innovation in SMEs Annual Report 2016.
Beneficiaries attract further investment but levels vary across EU
SME-I grant agreements do not impose reporting obligations on beneficiaries
following completion of the project. Instead, EASME monitors beneficiaries’ evolution
after finalisation of the SME-I grant through two database sources managed by
external contractors:
—
Source 1: is used to assess investment raised by SME-I beneficiaries. The database
is populated through collecting information on investment rounds which is
publicly available on-line. To assess the reliability of this source, we carried out
checks on a random sample of 30 Phase 2 beneficiaries, which corroborated the
figures obtained from information available on-line.
—
Source 2: is used to assess the evolution over time of SME-I beneficiaries’
performance in terms of turnover, net income, cash flow and employment levels.
Information collected directly from beneficiaries may be less reliable due to
self-reporting bias. In addition, the use of third-party information is more costefficient. At the same time, both sources of information used are incomplete, since:
—
Source 1 underestimates the actual investment raised by SME-I beneficiaries, due
to the unknown quantity of investment in the form of debt and equity injections
that are not published on-line.
—
Source 2 provides complete information for approximately only 60 % of all SME-I
beneficiaries36.
According to the information available on-line, the investment-to-grant ratio is
for Phase 2 beneficiaries that received an SME-I grant in 2014 and 2015 and exited
their innovation projects in 2017. Figure 15 shows the evolution in additional
investment raised by beneficiaries in the years following the granting of SME-I support.

These figures do not include investment rounds that are not disclosed online,
such as most of smaller equity injections and nearly all debt capital provided by banks,
funds and other financial players. Investments raised by only 11 % of Phase 2
beneficiaries are publicly available on-line.
In comparison, the majority of Phase 2 beneficiaries (78 % of respondents to
our survey) declared that Phase 2 funding had helped them leverage further funding to
support their innovation needs. Hence, beneficiaries’ actual capacity to attract
investment is presumably higher than that inferred from information available on-line.
According to third-party (source 1 see paragraph 117) information confirmed
by data collected in project reporting, SME-I beneficiaries show positive trends in
structural growth, with approximately 75 % of the companies having seen their
operating revenue grow since applying for the grant and 67 % increasing their
headcount.
A comprehensive set of impact metrics based on reliable data, combined with
complete automated profiling of the companies submitting project proposals and
selected for a grant, is necessary to develop an effective business intelligence strategy.
This could help:
—
identify participation patterns and potential imbalances;
—
link impact metrics with clusters of participants, providing valuable information
on how to maximise the overall impact of the instrument.
The SME-I under the Enhanced EIC Pilot has introduced improvements in terms
of company profiling, since the new administrative forms collect data on previous
rounds of investment, financial data and ownership structure of the proposers.
However, to date information has not been systematically collected at proposal
submission stage on the gender of shareholders, which is one of the criteria assessed
by jury members.
Significant differences exist among participating countries, with Phase 2
beneficiaries in the north-west of Europe managing to raise more private resources
than SMEs in the south and east (see Figure 16) 37. Disparities between the venture
capital markets in these countries partially explain such imbalances.

captured through web crawling technique do not appear in the chart.
The results of our survey among beneficiaries suggest that geographic location
is a determining factor affecting a company’s propensity to look for equity and/or debt
investment. In particular, 84 % of respondents in the Nordic countries and the United
Kingdom intend to look for equity injections, compared with 54 % in Spain and 42 % in
Italy.
The SME-I EAG raised the issue of cross-country variation and differing cultures
in the use of market-based instruments and recommended mapping the European
landscape “for a better knowledge of potential co-investors and to verify if crossborder operators are able to cover some financial gaps when national systems do not
work. Platforms and specific events could help in this process” 38.
Picture 3 shows the flows of additional investments above €10 million to
beneficiary countries, broken down by country of origin. Of the €1.8 billion in
additional investment raised by Phase 2 beneficiaries (see paragraph 119),
approximately €400 million comes from investors headquartered in the United States
and €181 million from investors in China. The largest single investor in Phase 2
beneficiaries is based in the United States, and three of the five biggest investments
(above €50 million) are from investors outside the EU.

Conclusions and recommendations
We found that the SME Instrument provides effective support to SMEs in
developing their innovation projects and that having the EU branding helps companies
to attract additional investment. However, links have not been established with EUbacked financial instruments that could help beneficiaries scale-up and bring
innovation projects to market. Both Phases 1 and 2 of the instrument provide effective
support to SMEs, though Phase 1 incurs disproportionally high administrative costs.
The instrument is competently managed by the Commission. The high number of
resubmissions and the limited resources have hindered the selection procedure and
development of the business acceleration services.
All recommendations are applicable to the SME Instrument’s successor under
Horizon Europe.
Targeting the right beneficiaries
The instrument’s broad objectives and targets, together with the changes
introduced during the course of its implementation, have caused uncertainty for
stakeholders. The current profile of companies fits the academic model of firms with
high growth potential but the instrument funds some SMEs that could have been
financed by the market (see paragraphs 28 to 39).
Geographical reach
Participation in the instrument varies markedly between countries, partly due
to factors beyond the control of the Commission but also because of the varying levels
of support provided by National Contact Points and the Enterprise Europe Network
(see paragraph 43 and 45 and Figure 5). With a limited budget, the Commission
organised events and communication activities, but its marketing and communication
was neither structured nor sufficiently well-targeted to reach the right companies (see
paragraphs 40 to 58).
Recommendation 1 – Improving communication strategy and
support to National Contact Points, in particular for those
Member States with the lowest level of participation
The Commission should:
focus better on marketing and communication strategy to raise awareness among
SMEs targeted of the funding opportunities offered by the instrument and its
successor under Horizon Europe,
improve its support to National Contact Points for SMEs and the Enterprise
Europe Network by promoting peer-learning projects and the exchange of best
practice and ensuring that support to the network of National Contact Points for
SMEs is operational at the beginning of the next framework programme.
Target implementation date: 2021
Selection of projects
Improvements have been made to evaluation and selection procedures over
the lifetime of the instrument, with the presentation to a jury being a particularly
useful addition in identifying the best proposals whilst complying with the time-togrant target (see paragraphs 65 to 69).
There is variability in scores awarded in the remote evaluation, which can be
partially explained by the limited resources and the high number of submissions.
Evaluator training is well appreciated, with scope for further feedback at various levels.
IT tools used are not fit for purpose, putting the evaluation process at risk (see
paragraphs 61 to 64; 70 to 73).
The resubmission of unsuccessful proposals is a large and increasing drain on
management and evaluation resources, increasing the administrative costs. Moreover,
it lowers the success rate thus discouraging participation (see paragraphs 74 to 79).
Recommendation 2 – Improving the selection procedure
In order to optimise the use of resources and ensure an efficient selection of the best
proposals, the Commission should refine the selection procedure in the following
ways:
provide remote evaluators with additional time to conduct their work;
set up a two-way information channel between remote evaluators and jury
members to allow the latter to access the remote evaluation and provide the
former with feedback on the quality of their work;
develop purpose-built IT tools to reliably manage the evaluation process;
limit the number of times a proposal can be resubmitted, thereby freeing up
resources which are currently used to re-perform evaluations of the same
proposal in multiple successive cut-offs;
In order to encourage the participation of more SMEs with excellent innovation
projects, the Commission should publish the success rate per project proposal.
Target implementation date: 2021
Effectiveness of support in the SME Instrument phases
Phase 1 provides effective support, thanks to the fast selection process, the EU
label for beneficiaries and the access to the business acceleration services. In addition,
it has attracted many innovative companies to the EU programme. However, it
imposes an excessive burden on the Commission´s administration of the instrument
and there are countries where similar programmes already exist (see paragraphs 81
to 89) Phase 1 was discontinued as from September 2019.
Phase 2 of the SME-I provides effective support to beneficiaries and is highly
appreciated by all stakeholders in its current form. It provides EU branding that gives
visibility to the companies and projects, helps them to raise additional investment, and
allows access to the EU network of coaching and business acceleration services (see
paragraphs 91 to 94).
Recommendation 3 – – Replacing Phase 1 and building on
Phase 2 support to SMEs
The Commission should:
propose to the Member States that the Commission manage a scheme similar to
Phase 1;
provide beneficiaries of this scheme with access to coaching and Business
Acceleration Services and an EU brand, and
preserve a scheme similar to Phase 2 within the EIC under Horizon Europe,
building on the results from the EIC Pilot.
Target implementation date: 2021
Coaching and business acceleration services have the potential to amplify
effects of the instrument but, having been launched late, are not sufficiently visible
and only a small share of SMEs made use of the services. The resources allocated are
limited and the services could be more tailor made and better target the demand side
(see paragraphs 95 to 103).
Recommendation 4 – Enhancing Business Acceleration Services
The Commission should enhance the business acceleration services by allocating
appropriate resources to this area, to:
deliver more tailor-made business acceleration services;
increase awareness among beneficiaries employing a targeted communication
approach and;
better address the demand side establishing connections with large private
customers and through public procurement for innovative projects.
Target implementation date: 2022
Attracting investment after SME Instrument funding
The majority of SME-I beneficiaries still need additional financing to support
their innovation endeavours and bring their innovation projects to market. However,
the Commission has taken little action to create links with EU-backed financial
instruments and has not explored collaboration opportunities with national
promotional institutions. Moreover, beneficiaries are largely unaware of EU-backed
financial instruments and the Commission’s knowledge of beneficiaries’ financial needs
is limited. The 2018 EIB report on access to finance of beneficiaries confirmed that
the available information on financial instruments is fragmented and communication
between private and public capital providers is limited (see paragraphs 107 to 116).
Recommendation 5 – Creating links with financial instruments
The Commission should:
regularly collect information on the amount and type of funding needed by SME-I
beneficiaries along the implementation of the innovation project;
raise awareness among beneficiaries on the existence of different financial
instruments at EU and national level and provide advice on those which would
best fit their financial needs;
identify and promote synergies with EU backed financial instruments in order to
support SME-I beneficiaries in fund raising;
collaborate with Member States and national promotional institutions to promote
nationally-backed financial instruments that might meet the financial needs of the
SME-I beneficiaries.
Target implementation date: 2022

Annex III – From the idea to the proposal of the EIC under
Horizon Europe
—
In June 2015, during the ERA Conference "A new start for Europe: Opening up to
an ERA of Innovation", the Commission launched the idea of an EIC.
—
The Commission launched a call for ideas in Spring 2016 in order to contribute to
the design of the EIC Pilot. Through this public consultation, the Commission
gathered “stakeholders' views on disruptive, market-creating innovation, on gaps
in the current innovation support landscape and on the potential remit of an
EIC” 39.
—
On 13 July 2016, the Commission organised a workshop with over 100
stakeholders from the private, research and public sectors to discuss the outcome
of the call for ideas” 40.

In November 2016, the Commission launched the Start-up/Scale-up initiative,
aiming to bring together under one umbrella a range of existing and new actions
to support start-up companies and companies that want to scale-up their
businesses 41.
—
The Commission set up the “EIC High Level Group of Innovators” (EIG HLG) in
January 2017 with the mandate of providing support in developing the EIC. The
group, made up of entrepreneurs, investors and innovation experts, met six times
between March 2017 and December 2018 and produced a “Full set of key
recommendations” in January 2018 42.

REPLIES OF THE COMMISSION TO THE SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN
COURT OF AUDITORS
“THE SME INSTRUMENT IN ACTION: AN EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE
PROGRAMME FACING CHALLENGES”
I. The SME Instrument is the first- ever support scheme in the history of Research Framework
Programme geared to innovative SMEs individually and implemented through an executive agency.
SMEs whose support was lagging behind in previous Framework Programmes have massively
subscribed to this new support scheme which, over time, has been fine-tuned in order to better
respond to their actual needs. The success of the first cut-off of the European Innovation Council
(EIC) Pilot Accelerator demonstrates that the pathway followed by the Commission corresponds to
the expectations of innovative SMEs.
INTRODUCTION
The Commission has implemented the testing of financial support of projects through equity
financing as of October 2019.
OBSERVATIONS
Members of the Access to Risk finance and SME Programme Committee - which often are also
National Contact Points (NCPs) - have been regularly kept informed of the changes introduced in the
SME instrument.
In addition, communication campaigns of such changes were implemented by RTD and EASME in
order to widely raise the awareness of the stakeholders involved including NCPs and the Enterprise
Europe Network (EEN).
The SME instrument is targeted at all types of innovative SMEs showing a strong ambition to
develop, grow and internationalize.
In line with the political priorities of the new Commission President elect, it is envisaged to
implement a dedicated EIC Accelerator call for 2020 subject to the approval of the Strategic
Programme Committee.
The Commission points out that this risk has been addressed in the EIC pilot as from 2019.
In addition, it underlines that there is a huge gap between the perception of the SME-I beneficiaries
and the reality when it comes to raising money from venture capital (VC) or business angels where
the success rate is quite low.
The Commission underlines that it made a major effort in promoting the EIC (enhanced) Pilot,
organising SME-I workshops at various tech conferences around Europe (including Slush, Wolves
Summit, Smart City). The changes introduced by the Enhanced EIC Pilot were communicated through
roadshows and dedicated events organised in all Member States.
Since the beginning of Horizon 2020, more than 65 outreach events have been organised in Member
States and Associated Countries. The Commission’s information campaign in the Member States,
organized together with National Contact Points, was intensified in 2019 with the participation of
SME’s. The Commission initiated a one-off series of national and regional stakeholder consultations
taking place in the Member States since June 2019 for the co-design of the Horizon Europe
implementation modalities where the next policy on the SMEs is going to be defined.
The Commission considers that the Access4SME coordination and support action helped raise
awareness amongst NCPs and EENs when changes in the design of the SME instrument have been
introduced.
EASME had indeed to renew 25% of the pool of evaluators on a yearly basis to be in conformity
with H2020 rules.
In response to the need for training of newcomers, since 2018, EASME has organised experts day in
Brussels inviting both experienced and new experts to train them and to create synergies.
On the basis of the feedback received from the jury members, the Commission has put in place a
practice in October 2019 whereby the jury members have two full weeks to review thoroughly the
proposals.
In order to address the issue pointed out by ECA in this paragraph, the Commission has
introduced a due diligence process in the EIC enhanced pilot. As from October 2019 - within the
enhanced EIC pilot offering blended finance - more detailed information has been requested from the
applicants regarding the ownership, intellectual property rights (IPR) and team composition. These
aspects are assessed now by the evaluators at remote and interviews steps.
Although not foreseen in the legal basis of the SME instrument and subject to approval of the
relevant Programme Committee, the Commission might propose a procedure limiting the number of
resubmissions.
The Commission stresses that the launch of the business acceleration services underwent
thorough preparation and was preceded by an open procurement procedure.
EASME collects information about additional financial needs of some beneficiaries, during and
after the implementation period of the grant, through several channels (application to BAS investor
events and company profile in Scaleup EU investor matching tool). Moreover, as from the cut-off of
October 2019, the companies need to provide how they intend to finance all needed development
activities until market entry, going beyond the requested grant and/or equity. It includes an indication
both about amounts needed and sources of potential funding.
The Commission has started to address the issue referred to by ECA in this paragraph by the
implementation of the EIC enhanced pilot in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Outreach and communication with stakeholders is a key priority of the Commission for the
sound implementation of the current and future framework programmes. Outreach events on
implementation modalities of Horizon 2020 are regularly organised in Member States and Associated
Countries. An additional series of events in the MS focuses on Horizon Europe.
Recommendation 1 – Improving communication strategy and support to National Contact
Points, in particular for those Member States with the lowest level of participation
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The Commission intends to plan a new approach as recommended as of January 2021 for
Horizon Europe.
Recommendation 2 – Improving the selection procedure
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The Commission has implemented this recommendation as from the evaluation process started in
October 2019, by sending the proposals two weeks in advance. In addition, from March 2020, the
remote experts will have 0,5 day to evaluate one proposal against 0,3 until January 2020.
The Commission intends to implement a new approach as recommended as of January 2020.
The Commission specifies that it already publishes the success rate per proposal submission and
agrees to add as well the success rate per project proposal.
Recommendation 3 – Replacing Phase 1 and building on Phase 2 support to SMEs
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
Some Member States under the lead of the Czech Republic have created an informal working group
in order to replicate Phase 1 funded at national level but keeping a central EU evaluation. The
Commission might propose to support them in their coordination through a dedicated grant.
The Horizon Europe Partial General Agreement foresees the continuation of the grant-only scheme
in the EIC Accelerator with a budget equivalent to Horizon 2020 while blended finance should be the
main use of the EIC Accelerator budget.
Recommendation 4 – Enhancing Business Acceleration Services
The Commission accepts this recommendation, within the resources available for the successor of the
SME Instrument under the next MFF.
Concerning raising the awareness of beneficiaries, a wide communication campaign has been
implemented for the InnovFin financial instruments by the EIB and EIF in all Member States between
2014-2016 developing contacts with many SMEs although SME instrument beneficiaries were not
specifically targeted. An Enhanced EIC Pilot communication campaign in Spring 2019 raised
awareness of potential beneficiaries on the possible equity financing through the EIC Accelerator.
The Commission has also started to collect data as from the cut-off of October 2019 from the
application process on the financial needs, including grants and equity of the companies applying to
successfully scale-up.
Recommendation 5 – Creating links with financial instruments
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The Grant and the equity agreements will regularly monitor the financial needs throughout the
implementation of the project and the scaling-up phases.
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The Commission will continue its awareness-raising activities.
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The Horizon Europe partial General Agreement foresees the possibility for beneficiaries to apply for
equity only as from 2021.
The Commission partially accepts this recommendation.
Considering that the recommendation involves also Member States, the Commission can only
implement it on a best effort basis.
The Commission will raise the awareness of Member States and national promotional institutions
through the channel of the relevant Programme Committee.
The creation of the Seal of Excellence for successful proposals which could not be awarded a SME
instrument grant was a first attempt to build synergies with national eco-system supporting
innovation.

With €3 billion for 2014-2020, the EU’s SME instrument strives to support
innovation in SMEs and start-ups by filling the gap in funding and
increasing commercialisation of research results.
We assessed whether the SME instrument delivers the expected benefits.
Overall, we concluded that it provides effective assistance to SMEs in
developing their innovation projects and that having the EU branding
helps companies to attract additional investment. The Commission
competently manages the instrument. However, we recommend
improving the targeting of beneficiaries, the geographical outreach and
the selection of projects. Also, more can be done to attract additional
funding that would help bring innovation projects to market.
As the SME Instrument has been redesigned for 2021-2027 as part of the
European Innovation Council (EIC), we make recommendations in
particular for preserving aspects of its design, improving project
selection, enhancing business acceleration services and creating
synergies with other financial instruments.

Executive summary
I Most Europeans consider cultural heritage to be important to them personally, as
well as to their community, region, country and to the EU as a whole. Culture is a
broad concept that includes various activities. In this special report, "cultural sites"
means the physical infrastructure where Europeans can experience culture.
II The EU cultural framework is primarily defined by the Treaties. They set an
overarching objective for the EU to respect its rich cultural diversity and ensure that
Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced. Culture is mainly a
competence of the Member States. The Union can only encourage cooperation
between Member States and support or supplement their actions.
III We assessed the effectiveness and sustainability of ERDF investments in cultural
sites by assessing the suitability of the EU cultural framework, its coordination with
funding arrangements and the implementation of ERDF funding.
IV The audit focused on the economic, social and cultural effects of these
investments and on the financial and physical sustainability of those sites. We
examined the work of the Commission and assessed 27 projects from seven Member
States. We also interviewed experts in the area.
V Overall the audit concluded that the current framework lacks focus and needs
more coordination to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of its ERDF
investments in cultural sites. We have made the following observations.
VI Regarding the framework for EU investments in cultural sites:
o
Culture is not addressed in the EU 2020 overarching Commission strategy. The
core EU strategic framework for culture is complex and only partially reflected in
EU funding. Translating its objectives into policy making at Member State level
remains a challenge, according to the Commission.
o
The Commission has been developing several initiatives that can promote cultural
sites, but EU cultural initiatives have a limited impact on the availability of EU
funds to beneficiaries. The ERDF Regulation has no provisions to benefit cultural
sites that participate in an EU cultural initiative. Coordination between the EU
funds themselves for investments in cultural sites is also limited.
o
At EU level, infrastructural investments are mainly funded through the ERDF,
which is an important source of funding for public investments in cultural sites for
around one third of Member States. However, investments in cultural sites are
not treated as a priority for the ERDF, which supports a different Treaty objective,
that of promoting social and economic cohesion. At national level, we found
examples of initiatives taken by Member States to finance cultural sites building
on private funds.
VII Regarding the effectiveness and sustainability of audited ERDF projects:
o
Despite the EU’s ambition to increase the social impact of cultural interventions,
the objectives of the ERDF OPs and projects are mostly economic. Cultural aspects
are the least addressed in the audited OPs and most managing authorities do not
even consider cultural aspects as a criterion when selecting projects.
o
Project performance could be assessed only for some of the completed audited
projects. The projects were operational, but we found several weaknesses in the
selection and reporting of indicators that limit the ability to use the reported data
to conclude on project performance.
o
The ERDF cannot fund the preservation of endangered sites unless the work has
an immediate economic and social effect; neither can Creative Europe. The
generation of economic impact, often performed through tourism promotion
strategies, could be counterproductive to the preservation of heritage sites.
o
The audited cultural sites are generally dependent on public subsidies to operate
and to finance their investment costs. Revenue generation is not sufficiently
incentivised by the current funding framework. The ERDF requirements for
revenue-generating projects imply that the higher the net revenues generated by
the project are, the less EU support is given. Revenue-generating activities were
also seldom incentivised in the selection procedures we audited.
VIII To ensure sound financial management when investing in cultural sites, we
recommend that the Commission should:
Improve the current strategic framework for culture within the remit of the
Treaties.
Encourage the use of private funds to safeguard Europe’s cultural heritage.
Strengthen the financial sustainability of cultural sites funded by the ERDF.
Take more specific action to preserve heritage sites.
Introduction
Culture and cultural sites
Most Europeans consider cultural heritage to be important to them personally, as
well as to their community, region, country and to the EU as a whole 1. Culture is also a
resource. It has been identified by the Commission as a driver for growth and jobs, an
enabler of social inclusion, and an asset for strengthening the EU’s international
relations 2. According to Eurostat statistics, the culture sector employed 8.7 million
people in the EU in 2018: 3.8 %of total employment 3.
Culture is a broad concept that includes various activities (e.g. crafts, arts and
audiovisual) in different economic sectors (e.g. manufacturing, services and
communications). In this special report, “cultural sites” means the physical
infrastructure where Europeans can experience culture. We distinguish between
heritage sites (ancient historical sites), and new cultural infrastructure (new buildings
used to foster art, music, theatre, etc.).
EU-level policymaking on culture gained momentum in 2017, with calls for EU
leaders to do more in the areas of education and culture 4. More recently, in its New
Strategic Agenda for 2019-24, the European Council committed to "invest[ing] in
culture and our cultural heritage, which are at the heart of our European identity"5.

Policy framework
The Treaties stipulate that the EU should “respect its rich cultural diversity and
(…) ensure that Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced” 6, and that the
EU must support culture in the Member States7. The Treaties also define the areas of
EU policy action (cultural dissemination, cultural heritage, non-commercial cultural
exchanges, artistic and literary creation, external cooperation). They also set a general
requirement for actions in other policy areas to take cultural aspects into account, a
requirement known as “mainstreaming” 8.
The EU has no legislative competence in the area of culture. Responsibility for
policy-making in this area remains with the Member States. In 2017, Member States
dedicated 1 %of their government spending to cultural services; in other words, €132
per EU citizen was spent on supporting cultural activities. Of that amount, roughly
% was spent on cultural investments (i.e. the acquisition, construction or
restoration of cultural assets, including physical work on cultural sites). Annex I
provides more details on government spending on cultural services and cultural
investments across the EU.
The framework for EU cooperation on culture is set by the Commission in the
form of the European Agenda for Culture. The Commission adopted the first such
agenda in 2007 9; it adopted a new one in 2018 10 (the “New Agenda”). The New
Agenda has three strategic objectives.
—
Social dimension – harnessing the power of culture and cultural diversity for
social cohesion and well-being by promoting cultural participation, the mobility of
artists and the protection of heritage.
Article 3(3) TEU.
Article 167(1) TFEU.
Article 167(4) TFEU, “The Union shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under
other provisions of the Treaties, in particular in order to respect and to promote the
diversity of its cultures”.

—
Economic dimension – support jobs and growth in the cultural and creative
sectors, by promoting arts and culture in education, fostering relevant skills and
encouraging innovation in culture.
—
External dimension – strengthening international cultural relations by making the
most of the potential of culture to foster sustainable development and peace.
The New Agenda establishes actions to be taken by the Commission and invites
Member States to address specific points. Member States define their priorities for EUlevel cooperation on culture and working methods through Work Plans for Culture
adopted by the Council of Ministers. The latest Work Plan covers the period from 2019
to 2022 11.
Sustainability and culture
The EU and its Member States are also active in multilateral forums and
organisations that address culture and cultural heritage policies, such as the Council of
Europe and UNESCO. Most recently, EU Member States committed to pursuing the
sustainable development goals developed by UNESCO 12, strengthening the objective of
sustainable development set out in the Treaties 13. The Council also identified
sustainability in cultural heritage as a priority for the current Work Plan for Culture
2019-2022.
Governance arrangements at the Commission
Currently, responsibility for developing and implementing culture-related policies
lies with the Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC). To
support EU policy-making on culture, the Commission manages the Creative Europe
Programme, which is the sole fund exclusively targeting the EU’s cultural and creative
sectors 14.

Culture related infrastructural investments can only be EU-funded under the
European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds). Among the ESI funds, ERDF 15 is
the main source of EU funding for investments in cultural sites. The ERDF is
implemented by the Commission and Member States in share management. That
means that the Partnership Agreements (PAs) and the ERDF operational programmes
(OPs) are prepared by the Member States and have to be approved by the
Commission.
Following the mainstreaming principle, various other EU funds are also available
for culture-related projects both within and outside the EU. This means that several
Directorates-General are also involved in the actual implementation of a cultural
strategic framework through other EU policies and funding instruments (see Annex II).

Audit scope and approach
Considering the increased attention given to culture at EU level, we decided to
carry out an audit on the effectiveness and sustainability of EU investments in cultural
sites, i.e. the acquisition, rehabilitation and construction of new cultural infrastructure
and heritage sites. To do so, we audited the main EU fund available for those
investments (ERDF) and assessed the following aspects.
Part 1: Suitability of the EU cultural framework and coordination with funding
arrangements for investments in cultural sites
—
The suitability of the strategic and legislative framework in place at EU level for
EU-funded investments in cultural sites.
—
The coordination of Commission initiatives between financial and policy
instruments, in particular with the Creative Europe and EAFRD.
—
The coordination of ERDF funding with other EU funds.
Part 2: Implementation of ERDF funding
—
The support and guidance given by the Commission to the Member States when
adopting partnership agreements (PAs) and operational programmes (OPs) to
ensure that the funding of cultural sites brings effective and sustainable results.
—
The effectiveness and sustainability of results of ERDF projects on cultural sites.
The audit focused on the economic, social and cultural effects of ERDF
investments in cultural sites and on the financial and physical sustainability of those
sites, and covered the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods under the
investment for jobs and growth goal, as well as the draft design of the post-2020
programme period.
At EU level, we examined the work of the Directorate-General responsible for
culture (DG EAC) and the Directorate-General responsible for the ERDF (DG REGIO). At
Member State level:
o
we visited three Member States (Italy, Poland and Portugal) and performed desk
reviews, with a more reduced scope, for four additional Member States (Croatia,
France, Germany and Romania). We chose these Member States because they are
amongst the major recipients of ERDF support to investments in cultural sites;
o
we assessed 14 OPs (see Annex III for the list of OPs covered by the audit);
o
we audited 27 projects, 15 of them on the spot and 12 by desk review (see
Table 1 and Annex IV). The projects were selected based on a wide range of
criteria: amounts spent or committed, type of site (heritage sites or new cultural
infrastructures), existence or not of labels and participation in EU initiatives. We
also carried out a survey to the beneficiaries of all these projects. All beneficiaries
replied. We also audited 21 selection procedures (see Annex V).

Lastly, we interviewed officials of international organisations (UNESCO’s World
Heritage Centre, Cultural Routes of the CoE, ICOMOS) and the NGO Europa Nostra, as
well as 11 national experts in the three visited Member States to get a better overview
of the needs and challenges faced by cultural sites, and to identify good practices.
We hope that the audit will provide insight into the relevance and effectiveness
of the EU’s interventions on cultural sites. More generally, we intend for it to
contribute to the ongoing debate on the place of culture in the EU.
Observations
The existing framework for EU investments in cultural sites
lacks focus and coordination is limited
The strategic framework for EU action in culture is complex and only
partially reflected in EU funding
An appropriate framework for EU investments in cultural sites is key to
maximising the effects of investments on achieving the objectives defined in the
framework. A prerequisite is a clear strategic framework for EU action in the area of
culture, with strong coordination between the regulatory (i.e. EU funds legislation) and
non-regulatory frameworks (i.e. strategies). Objectives should be clearly set based on
identified needs and correspondingly measures should be designed. Objectives should
be realistic and addressed by appropriate policy instruments and funding. The
requirements on stakeholders should be set in line with their competences.
Monitoring the framework is essential for assessing progress in achieving objectives.
Multiple EU strategic frameworks coexist which impact on EU action in culture
The EU’s strategic direction has been formulated in ten-year plans (the Lisbon
and the Europe 2020 strategies). These plans do not address culture and are also not
synchronised with the Commission’s five-year terms of office, or with the EU’s sevenyear cycle of funding periods.
Regarding cultural policy making at EU level, the EU has a framework in place that
includes several layers of responsibility (see paragraphs 04 to 07). At its highest level,
the Treaties and the EU’s international commitments (e.g. 2005 UNESCO Convention
on diversity and cultural expressions) define the framework. It is developed in greater
detail in the Commission’s Agendas and the Council’s four-year Work Plans for Culture;
together, these form the EU’s core cultural framework. Several documents of strategic
relevance complement the framework (see Annex VI). In a previous publication, we
already reported that the coexistence of multiple strategic frameworks, with
overlapping periods and objectives, is complex and can be confusing (see Picture 1) 16.
Paragraphs 16 to 18 of ECA Briefing Paper on Delivering performance in Cohesion,
June 2019.
Picture 1 – Timeline of events
Source: ECA.
The complexity is exacerbated by the coexistence of different players
(Commission, Council and Member States) that simultaneously develop and implement
cultural action without systematically referring to the Commission’s Agendas. Within
the Commission, cultural aspects are taken into account (“mainstreamed”) in various
different policies, with different responsible departments.
The monitoring of the objectives in the Commission’s Agenda for Culture is
insufficiently developed
The main common strategic objectives guiding EU action in the area of culture
are set out in the Commission’s Agendas (see paragraph 06). Those are not translated
into clear operational objectives. Although there are extensive examples of EU
measures under each objective, it is unclear what the EU seeks to achieve through
these measures. The New Agenda does not have any provisions concerning the
monitoring of achievement of the objectives set, or any indicators to measure
progress. According to the Commission this is because the Commission and the
Member States do not have jointly defined objectives, indicators or targets for cultural
policy making. The Commission also does not make use of the indicators available at
programme level, i.e. the indicators defined by the different EU programmes, to assess
the success of the implementation of the New Agenda.
Concerted action with Member States in this area is performed under the
Council’s Work Plans for Culture through a non-binding, intergovernmental framework
for cooperation between Member States called the Open Method of Coordination
(“OMC”). According to the Commission, the “channelling of the OMC
recommendations into policy making at national and European level remains a
challenge” 17. Even though the economic and social objectives of the New Agenda are
broadly followed by the cultural policy frameworks of the Member States in our
sample, none specifically referred to the New Agenda and only two referred to the
Agenda.
The Commission’s Agenda is not taken into account in the main EU funds which
provide finance to Culture
In terms of EU funding, culture is mainly a means of achieving other EU priorities
and objectives (e.g. supporting urban and regional development, enterprise, tourism)
rather than a core priority itself. These priorities are tackled through different EU
funds. The only EU fund designed for culture is the Creative Europe programme, but it
is very small in terms of funding. It allocates roughly €209 million per year from the EU
budget 18 for culture across 28 Member States and 8 non-EU countries. This amount is
similar to the annual operating costs of some individual cultural sites. For example, the
Paris National Opera House had costs of €200.8 million in 2018 19.
From the 12 EU funds with the potential to support culture that we analysed,
only the Creative Europe regulation refers to the Commission’s 2007 Agenda (see
Annex II). The two successive Commission Agendas were established after the
multiannual financial frameworks for the ESI Funds were put in place (see Picture 1)
and could not, therefore, be taken into account in the ESI Funds.

The Commission has developed several initiatives that can promote
cultural sites, but coordination with funding arrangements is limited
An appropriate framework for EU investments in cultural sites needs effective
coordination arrangements between the different policies contributing to the
promotion of cultural sites. Coordinated action within the Commission can ensure
complementarities between EU funds and guarantee an efficient use of financial
resources to develop the proposed initiatives.
The Commission has developed several initiatives to promote cultural sites
The Commission has been developing an extensive list of initiatives to promote
cultural sites over the last decade, especially in the field of heritage. The most recent
of these is the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage (EYCH), which resulted in a
European framework for action on cultural heritage 20, and which was the first
European, cross-sectoral and integrated approach to cultural heritage. Other initiatives
include awards or labels given to foster sustainable tourism or to highlight a particular
cultural site (see Table 2).

The authorities of the Member States we visited perceived the European Capitals
of Culture (ECoC) initiative as being particularly beneficial (see Box 1 for an example of
positive impact described to us by the Portuguese authorities). One of the audited
beneficiaries confirmed that it observed a significant increase in the number of visitors
during the European Capital of Culture 2016 hosted by Wrocław. The experts we
interviewed also praised some of the Commission’s recent initiatives (e.g. the 2018
European Year of Cultural Heritage, the New Agenda).
Box 1
Example of positive impacts of the European Capital of Culture
initiative
The city of Guimarães, in Portugal, was European Capital of Culture in 2012.
According to the ex post study that the authorities of the Member State
performed, the initiative included investments in cultural infrastructure and urban
requalification, of roughly €41.7 million of eligible expenditure, along with a
cultural programme implemented throughout 2012. The number of overnight
stays in the region is estimated to have increased 43 %in that year, an increase
which generated 2 111 jobs.

At international level, there are additional labels awarded to cultural sites (see
Annex VII). The co-existence of multiple labels and awards makes their intended value
unclear.
The coordination of the Commission’s cultural initiatives with ERDF funding
arrangements is limited
We analysed the coordination of the DG EAC’s cultural initiatives with the ERDF.
In particular, we asked the beneficiaries of the visited projects about the effects of the
European Heritage label and other Commission initiatives. The cultural initiatives of
the Commission have very limited impact on the availability of ERDF funds to
beneficiaries. There are no provisions in the ERDF regulation or in the ERDF OPs
covered by the audit, which would provide benefit to projects already part of a
Commission’s cultural initiative.
Funding arrangements are available for UNESCO sites under the ERDF. In the
2014-2020 programme period, the current ERDF Regulation sets a higher threshold for
UNESCO sites (€20 million of maximum ERDF co-financing support for UNESCO sites
and €10 million for other cultural sites) 21. The UNESCO label was also used as criterion
for selecting projects in five of the 21 selection procedures that we reviewed. National
labels were also considered important by the authorities in the Member States, with
four of the audited selection procedures giving advantage to projects with these labels.
Our sample of projects contained two sites with a European Heritage Label and
one site participating in the ECoC initiative. The participation of cultural sites to EU
initiatives was not considered as a criterion by the authorities in the Member States
when selecting projects for ERDF financing (see Annex V). This was also not suggested
by the Commission in their observations before approving OPs. The European panel
responsible for monitoring European Heritage sites stated that the absence of funding
for sites awarded the label could potentially jeopardise the label’s sustainability and
visibility 22. The label is also a concern for the Parliament, which recommended that it
be given greater visibility 23.
Complementarities between EU funds are insufficiently visible for investments in
cultural sites
In line with the mainstreaming principle, the implementation of the objectives set
in the Commission’s 2007 Agenda is de facto spread across different policies and
supported through different funds managed by 15 different Directorates-General
within the Commission. Coordination between the different Directorates is mainly
performed through an inter-service group on culture and cultural heritage and, when
adopting relevant programmes and regulations, through inter-service consultations.

of the Union (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, pp. 1–222 ).

P8_TA(2017)0062, 2 March 2017.
The results of such coordination are not evident in the different EU funds
Regulations. Although the Regulations reflect, to different degrees, some of the
elements of the 2007 Agenda, except for Creative Europe, none of the EU funds
specifically refers to it and most do not address culture as an objective (see
paragraph 24 and Annex II).
The Common Provisions Regulation24 (CPR) sets out arrangements to promote
coordination between funds, namely by establishing a common strategic framework
and a requirement for Member States to report on the coordination arrangements
between EU funds in the PAs and OPs. We identified weaknesses in these coordination
arrangements specifically for cultural sites.
Firstly, even though heritage sites can potentially be funded through different ESI
Funds depending on their objectives, the Commission does not assess the
complementarities and possible synergies in the use of EU funds specifically for
heritage sites when adopting PAs and OPs. The coordination arrangements described
in the OPs and PAs are general, and do not always specifically refer to cultural sites. In
particular, we analysed how EAFRD investments in cultural sites were differentiated
from the ERDF investments in cultural sites in the PAs, the national EAFRD
programmes and in the ERDF OPs. In four Member States the differences between the
two funds were not clear, and the two EU funds could potentially fund the same type
of project.
Secondly, coordination with Creative Europe or its predecessor fund (“Culture
programme 25”) was not mentioned in the sample of strategic documents of three
Member States covered in our audit. Lastly, at project level, four of the 21 assessed
selection procedures in our sample specifically rewarded complementarities with
other EU funds as a criterion for funding, albeit without mentioning Creative Europe in
particular. As a result, in only one of the cultural sites in our sample, a Creative Europe
project complemented an ERDF project.

The ERDF is a structuring instrument for Member States’ investments in
cultural sites, but such investments are not treated as a priority for the
ERDF
In an appropriate framework for investments in cultural sites, the EU funds with
the most available funding for investments in cultural sites, in particular the ERDF,
should reflect the EU cultural framework in their policies. To this end, the
Commission’s objectives in the area of culture should be clearly reflected in the
Member States’ partnership agreements and operational programmes.
The overall EU amount spent on investments in cultural sites is not specifically
monitored
Although spending on culture represents only a small portion of the overall ERDF
budget (roughly €4.7 billion planned for the 2014-2020 programme period, or 2.3 %),
the ERDF is the most significant source of EU funding for investments in cultural sites.
The CPR requires the authorities in the Member States to report expenditure by
categories of intervention. One of these is the “Protection, development and
promotion of public cultural and heritage assets”. However the category is broader
than infrastructural investments, and Member States do not use it consistently. The
evolution of the scope of ERDF investment in culture and its monitoring arrangements
are presented in Annex VIII.
In 2014, the Commission performed a mapping exercise on the available EU funds
for cultural heritage actions 26. The exercise was “non-exhaustive” 27. It did not provide
detailed and updated data on the amounts of EU funding allocated to and spent on
cultural heritage, including on related physical investments. This information is
unknown because not all the different EU funds require Member States and
beneficiaries to provide information on cultural measures in systematically.

activities, 2014 version (https://www.europa-creativa.eu/Files/uploads/29-2014-heritagemapping_en.pdf) and 2017 update (https://ec.europa.eu/culture/sites/culture/files/2014heritage-mapping-version-2017_en.pdf).
“Ibid, 2014 and 2017 versions, p. 2.”
The Commission has been striving to harmonise different types of statistical data
on government spending on culture, and its effects. The basic reference for EU cultural
statistics is a 2012 report by the European Statistical System Network on culture 28.
Eurostat has been following up the work performed by the network29. Strengthening
the evidence base at EU level is also one of the key principles of the ongoing European
Framework for Action on Cultural Heritage20. However, so far, there is no compulsory
EU framework for data collection and reporting on culture or cultural sites.
The ERDF provides a framework for Member States’ investments in cultural sites
In a 2017 ECA audit report30, we stated that the current ERDF Regulation provides
a more structured approach for EU interventions than in the 2007-2013 programme
period, by requiring OPs to set out in a more robust manner the interventions’ aims
(specific objectives/results) and how these are expected to be achieved (required
funding, actions to be undertaken and expected outputs). This is particularly the case
when actions are designed around investment priorities, such as cultural heritage (see
paragraph 44).
The 2014-2020 framework also has shown improvements with regard to
indicators to measure the ERDF support to cultural sites, with the current Regulation
setting a common output indicator related to cultural sites. For the 2021-2027
programme period, the Commission proposes to increase the number of common
indicators related to cultural sites and, for the first time, to include common result
indicators (see Annex VIII). In a recent ECA opinion, we have welcomed the
introduction of common indicators and stated that they represent an important step
towards enhancing the focus on performance 31.

Agreements and programmes in Cohesion: spending more targeted on Europe 2020
priorities, but increasingly complex arrangements to measure performance.
Paragraph 59 of ECA Opinion No 6/2018.
The importance of the ERDF framework can be seen in the cultural strategies of
the three Member States we visited. In Poland, the cultural strategy considers culture
as a means of achieving the economic and social cohesion sought by the ERDF. In Italy,
the government developed a national funding programme to complement the national
ERDF OP on culture 32 with the same objectives and funding criteria. In Portugal, the
Commission requested EU funding to follow a mapping exercise, where the needs for
investing in cultural sites are analysed and priorities for investment identified.
The ERDF is an important source of funding for public investments in cultural sites in
some Member States
The ERDF Regulation provides a range of thematic objectives (TOs) and
investment priorities for the Member States to select depending on their needs. In the
2014-2020 programme period, support to cultural sites specifically addresses heritage
sites under investment priority 6(c) “conserving, protecting, promoting and developing
natural and cultural heritage” within TO 6 “preserving and protecting the environment
and promoting resource efficiency”. Cultural sites can also be supported under other
investment priorities, namely as part of ERDF support to innovation (TO1) or SME
competitiveness (TO3) or when part of a broader territorial development strategy
promoting employment (TO8) or social inclusion (TO9). Urban regeneration, under
investment priority 6(e), is also a common priority selected in the OPs to support
cultural sites.
Over the period of 2010 to 2017, the amount of ERDF funds invested in cultural
sites was around € 750 million per year. They accounted for more than 25 % of all
public investment on cultural services in around one third of the Member States and
for more than 50 % in Portugal and Greece (see Figure 1). The fund was therefore an
important source of funding for investments in cultural sites for many Member States.
At project level, according to our survey, 44 % of the projects would not have been
implemented without ERDF support, and 48 % would have been postponed or would
only have been implemented with a reduced scope.

Notes: (1) We use Eurostat’s data on public spending in cultural services (COFOG: GF08.2) to estimate
Member States’ investments in cultural sites. This is the closest estimate available. Capital investments
in cultural services include: investment grants (D92), gross fixed capital formation (P.51g) and
acquisition less disposals of non-financial non-produced assets (NP). The figures represent an annual
average of the amounts spent by national and local administrations (General government expenditure)
over the years 2010-2017; (2) ERDF investments on cultural sites, expressed as an annual average,
include the spending recorded on cultural sites for the 2007-2013 programme period and the 2014-2020
programme period (until 2018);
* For Croatia, only the funds spent under the current programming period were taken into account.

At national level, we found examples of how Member States are diversifying the
sources of revenue of cultural sites and developing funding schemes that built on
private funds (see Box 2). The diversification of funding for cultural heritage is also one
of the topics tackled by the Council in the 2019-2022 Work Plan for Culture 33.
Box 2
Examples of funding schemes developed at national level
Heritage Lottery (France): Following the example of the UK, the French
government launched a national heritage lottery in 2018 to support the
restoration of some iconic local heritage sites (€20 million was collected that year
for the restoration of 18 sites).
Heritage lottery (Italy): Since 1997 that a share of lottery revenues is reserved for
the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and allocated to a wide range of heritage projects
across Italy related to the recovery and preservation of cultural heritage, including
archaeological, historical, artistic, archival and library projects, as well as for the
restoration of landscaping and cultural activities. From our sample of projects, The
Ex-Convento di Sant’ Antonio, one of our sample projects, received circa
€2,4 million from the “Programma Triennale Lotto 2007-2009”. The Pantheon in
Rome and the Greek theatre in Syracuse are other examples of cultural sites
funded.
Corrective taxation (Poland): Poland set up a new fund in 2018 to finance the
protection and renovation of historical sites. The funding comes from the
administrative fines imposed for infringements of the requirements for the
protection of historical sites.
Investments in cultural sites are not treated as a priority for the ERDF
The ERDF aims to promote economic, social and territorial cohesion, one of the
EU’s main missions as provided for in the TEU 34. This mission, together with the
objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, led
to an ERDF framework centred on economic and social considerations. Investments in
cultural sites are therefore a means to an end, to be funded only when they generate a
socio-economic impact.
See paragraph 07.
Article 3 (3) of TEU.
In addition to the socio-economic rationale, the 2014-2020 ERDF Regulation
introduced restrictions on ERDF investments to cultural sites, funding only small-scale
infrastructure. It is not clear how this provision contributes to the objectives set in the
Commission’s Agendas for Culture. Also, the initial Regulation was not clear what
“small-scale” meant, creating uncertainty about the types of projects that the ERDF
could fund.
Different interpretations were given to the ERDF restriction. Firstly, the
Commission administratively defined “small-scale” as investments with total cost of up
to €5 million (€10 million for UNESCO sites) 35. Following a complaint made by eleven
Member States to the Commission 36, the Commission stated that there was flexibility
on how different small-scale items of infrastructure could be supported as part of one
single integrated operation. Only four years later, the revised 2014-2020 ERDF
Regulation provided clarity to the legal basis, setting the ceilings to €10 million (€20
million for UNESCO sites) of eligible ERDF support.
Due to this funding restriction, investments in cultural sites were under scrutiny
by the Commission during the 2014-2020 negotiations and were not a priority for
investment under the ERDF. In the three visited Member States, and for the sampled
OPs and PAs, the Commission did not identify investments in culture as a priority area
during the negotiations and expressed the view that culture was only to be dealt with
through e-culture 37 (Italy and Poland) and in the context of promoting the cultural and
creative industries38 (Poland and Portugal). The Commission also suggested a
reduction in allocations to cultural investments (Poland and Italy) and imposed funding
restrictions in all cases.
The cultural policies of Member States are not specifically assessed under the
ERDF. For the PAs and OPs in our sample, the Commission did not require Member
States to plan cultural interventions in accordance with the Commission’s European
Agenda for Culture when adopting them for the 2014-2020 programme period.

Mixed effectiveness and sustainability of audited ERDF projects
We assessed the effectiveness of ERDF projects concerning cultural sites based on
the achievement of the projects’ objectives and intended results. In particular, we
assessed the achievement of the economic, social and cultural objectives. The
implementation of these objectives generates external effects in society.
We assessed sustainability as the ability of the site to continue its operations,
which requires regular maintenance and, when necessary, restoration of the physical
infrastructure. It also requires the availability of financial and human resources. These
activities are internal to the cultural site.
The described objectives and sustainability factors are interlinked (see Picture 2).
A cultural investment project, in principle, has effects in the achievement of all three
objectives and on the sustainability of the cultural site. However, these effects may
have conflicting directions. Economic objectives can increase the financial
sustainability of the site but may hamper its preservation (e.g. overtourism, cuts to
maintenance costs). Some social objectives may lead to decreasing financial
sustainability (e.g. decreases in entrance fees) or hamper the site’s preservation (e.g.
overcrowding). Cultural objectives may increase social inclusiveness and generate
economic effects, but they may also have a negative impact on the financial
sustainability of the site (e.g. cost increases as the range of cultural activities on offer
increases).

The completed audited projects were operational, their objectives were
mostly economic and it is not always possible to know whether they
were reached
The ERDF projects should reach the objectives defined at project selection. To
measure the achievement of objectives, beneficiaries of ERDF projects should define
relevant indicators and report reliable achievements of targets. After completion of
the ERDF project, cultural sites should be active, and should contribute to the
achievement of objectives in the OPs from which they are funded.
The ERDF OPs and projects examined focus mostly on economic objectives, and less
on social and cultural ones
In line with ERDF objectives, all the OPs in our sample explore cultural sites as a
resource to improve the competitiveness of the economy or to develop the territories
(see Annex IX). This is done through tourism promotion or urban development
strategies (see Box 3).
Box 3
Example of an urban development strategy
The city of Katowice is the capital of Śląskie province, the centre of the largest
metropolis in southern Poland, with a population of 4.8 million. The region
flourished in the 19th century thanks to the rapid development of the mining and
steel industry. From the late nineties of the 20th century, Katowice initiated a
strategic reorientation, targeting culture as a key priority for the city.
The audited project, the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra (NOSPR), is
the result of that strategy. Until 2006, the area where now the NOSPR is located,
in the heart of the city, was a former coal mine.

In a period of ten years, besides NOSPR, the city also built, in the same area, an
International Congress Centre and a Museum (the “Muzeum Śląskie w
Katowicach”). The three big investments totalled roughly €231 million and
received major support from the ERDF (€123 million). For those investments,
Katowice obtained the UNESCO label of “Creative City of Music” in 2015 and,
in 2018, accommodated the UN climate summit.

The pre-eminence of economic objectives is demonstrated by assessing the result
indicators at OP and project level. Regarding the audited priority axes, 26 of the 32
defined result indicators aim to capture the economic effects of ERDF interventions.
Annex IX summarises how the different objectives of the audited priority axes are
measured by result indicators. It shows the importance of the economic dimension,
with all audited priority axes having an economic objective in both programme
periods.
At project level, all result indicators selected by the beneficiaries of the
2014-2020 audited projects, and 45 out of 59 result indicators for the 2007-2013
programme period, measure the economic impact of the projects (see Figure 2).
Figure 2 – Percentage (number) of indicators in the audited projects
measuring the cultural, social and economic objectives
Notes: (1) In the 2014-2020 period, there are only five projects with result indicators; (2) Each indicator
can measure more than one objective, therefore, the total can be higher than 100 %.
Source: ECA.
Regarding social objectives, the necessity to strengthening the social impact of
cultural interventions has been widely expressed, by the Commission in the Agendas,
by the Parliament 39 and by the Council 40. Special attention has been given to
integrating migrants, fostering gender balance and working within partnerships
between the cultural sector and other sectors. A recent informal meeting of EU
Member State ministers responsible for European affairs and ministers for culture on
the protection of cultural heritage called for fostering the engagement and awareness
of the European youth with regard to cultural heritage 41.
The audited priority axes with social objectives are mainly aimed at improving the
accessibility of cultural sites or at increasing social cohesion. The most frequent
indicator used to measure the social aspects of projects is the number of visitors (see
Figure 2). The effect that cultural sites have on visitors, such as wellbeing, support to
disadvantageous groups or promotion of educational measures, is not often recorded

with dedicated indicators. Social activities were nevertheless carried out, to different
degrees, in 10 of the 11 completed projects we visited (see Box 4).
Box 4
Example of social activities developed at a cultural site
The San Carlo theatre, in the city of Naples in Italy, is the oldest opera house in the
world still in use. The Theatre is not only an opera house; it is also a place where
visitors can experience dance performances, concerts, visit exhibitions, go to the
museum or do a guided tour. The Theatre focuses particularly on engaging youths.
Besides the ballet school, the cultural site also has an educational project, run in
partnership with an association funded by Creative Europe. The project aims to
educate children from an early age to sing and love opera by first educating the
teachers through a series of musical training courses and then by providing
support to the teacher when training the students at the schools. Completed the
musical training, teachers, students and family members experience a show at the
Theatre. The pupils perform and sing on stage, accompanied by professional
singers and by the Orchestra, wearing costumes they have made themselves.

As for cultural objectives, the priority axes we audited were mainly aimed at
preserving cultural heritage. Not all of them had a clearly set cultural aim and the ones
that did, in most cases, did not set result indicators to measure the achievement of
those objectives (see Annex IX). Cultural aspects are not considered as relevant by the
ERDF managing authorities when selecting projects in almost half of the procedures
audited (see Annex V).
All completed audited projects were operational at the time of the audit, but project
performance often cannot be assessed
All the eleven completed projects we visited were operational at time of the
audit, and the management teams of the sites were committed and dedicated to its
preservation and promotion. To assess the effectiveness of the projects in achieving its
targets, we analysed the achievement of 71 result indicators reported by the
beneficiaries of the 17 completed projects that had result indicators in our sample (see
Annex IV).
Less than a third of the audited projects achieved all the targets set within the
period defined. For the remaining projects, no conclusion on their performance can be
drawn (see Figure 3). However, at the time of the audit, three additional projects had
reached their targets. Nevertheless, we found several weaknesses in the selection and
reporting of indicators.

Regarding the selection of indicators, we note that six projects had no result
indicators at all. This means that for around a quarter of the completed projects, the
achievement of project objectives cannot be measured by result indicators. In
addition, 16 out of the 71 result indicators cannot be used to conclude on the
effectiveness of the project because they are not relevant to the project objectives. A
further 12 are actually not result but output indicators.
All the eleven visited projects that were completed at the time of the audit had
result indicators. We analysed the reliability of the achievements reported on these
indicators by the beneficiaries and concluded that 18 out of 35 reported achievements
are not reliable due to incorrect calculation of achievements, lack of evidence to
corroborate achievements or because estimations could not be verified (see Table 3).

The “number of visitors” is the indicator mostly used by the beneficiaries of the
visited projects, but it is often unreliable (see Table 3). Only in two out of the nine
completed visited projects with indicators on the number of visitors were we able to
reconcile the numbers of visitors reported to the managing authorities. In addition, the
link between the increase in the number of tourists and the type of works performed is
not always visible. For three of the 11 heritage sites visited, the scope of the
interventions was limited to partial restoration works (e.g. roof renovations or
refurbishing of particular rooms), which cannot directly or exclusively lead to an
increase in the number of tourist visits.
The achievement of OP objectives does not directly depend on individual project
performance
We already concluded in a previous report that 2014-2020 ERDF result indicators
are not specifically related to the interventions funded by the programme 42. Regarding
the audited OPs, for both programme periods, the result indicators set are also mostly
limited in their ability to measure progress towards achieving the objectives set.
Almost half of the OPs’ result indicators are not directly affected by the specific results
of ERDF projects, but by external factors (see Box 5). At project level, the achievement
of more than half the targets set for the result indicators defined by the projects does
not directly influence the results achieved at OP level because the OPs do not include
these indicators.
Box 5
Example of a result indicator defined at OP level that does not
measure the direct effects of the projects
The 2014-2020 Portuguese OP for the central region is aimed at fostering the
region as a touristic destination of excellence. This is performed through the
preservation and touristic promotion of cultural and natural heritage. The ERDF
therefore funds renovation and restoration works at heritage sites, including
UNESCO sites.
To measure the success of the measures, the OP sets as a result indicator the
“number of overnight stays at hotels and other touristic accommodations in the
region”. In 2017, the target set for 2023 had already been exceeded by roughly
%, at least partly thanks to a tourism boom in the Member State. Even though
the ERDF projects might have contributed to this result, it should be noted that, in
2017, projects were only starting to be implemented (priority axis 7 had
committed only 68 % of the available total eligible costs). The contribution of ERDF
projects is therefore limited, and affected by external factors. The result indicator
measures the impact of ERDF interventions rather than the results, i.e. the direct
effects.
Paragraphs 116 and 117 of ECA Special Report 02/2017: “The Commission’s negotiation of
2014-2020 Partnership Agreements and programmes in Cohesion: spending more targeted
on Europe 2020 priorities, but increasingly complex arrangements to measure
performance”.
Insufficient attention is given to the sustainability of cultural sites
The sustainability of EU investments needs to be ensured at all phases of the
project. The first step is to verify, at application stage, that beneficiaries have the
capacity to operate or continue operating the site. For this reason, cultural sites
benefiting from EU investments should have the ambition to become self-financing to
the greatest extent possible 43 (i.e. with their operating revenues covering operating
costs) Maintenance is fundamental for the preservation of cultural sites; it should be
properly planned to limit the cost of future work, and the site’s deterioration.
Monitoring arrangements should be in place to assess whether the results of EU
investments persist over time.
ERDF requirements do not address the preservation of funded cultural sites
Heritage sites in particular need constant maintenance, and face several risks to their
preservation
The importance of regular maintenance to heritage preservation is acknowledged
in the Charters of Venice and Krakow 44. All visited beneficiaries reported conducting
regular assessments on the physical status of their site, but maintenance
arrangements are decided by beneficiaries and take different forms. ICOMOS
highlighted that cultural sites in the EU do not focus enough on prevention and regular
maintenance. Only one visited heritage site had an updated prioritised and budgeted
multiannual maintenance plan. This is a good practice required for UNESCO World
Heritage Sites45 (see Box 6) and recommended for all cultural heritage sites46.

Example of a Maintenance Plan
Since 2015, the archaeological park of Pompeii has had a comprehensive
monitoring and maintenance plan in place to protect its buildings, art and
artefacts from deterioration. The plan has different components, defining: (i)
priorities of intervention needed to preserve the site, and its corresponding time
schedule; (ii) measures to improve the conditions for its use and to promote
related tourism; (iii) measures to mitigate natural disaster risks; (iv) governance
arrangements; and (v) monitoring arrangements. Since 2015, the site also has also
set up a digital archive with information on maintenance that has been carried out
and subsequent inspections.
Maintenance works had been carried out at the majority of the eleven heritage
sites we visited, and some beneficiaries declared that more works are planned for the
future. In three cases, it had been necessary to renovate the site completely due to a
lack of maintenance in the past. This shows the importance of regular maintenance.
Preventive maintenance is also fundamental in order to address the different
risks that cultural sites face to their preservation. The results of our survey suggest that
heritage sites are the sites which face the most direct threats to their physical
preservation (see Figure 4). The main risks identified are local conditions affecting the
physical fabric of the site (e.g. rain, wind, dust) and pollution. However, the biggest
risks facing beneficiaries of both new cultural infrastructures and heritage sites are
management and institutional factors (e.g. insufficient financial and human resources,
lack of management plan).

Maintenance and risk assessment are not funding requirements for the audited ERDF
projects
None of the audited beneficiaries was required, when applying for ERDF funding,
to demonstrate how their site would be preserved after project completion, or to
provide a maintenance plan. For heritage sites in particular, the urgency of physical
work on the site was also not considered an important factor for ERDF funds, with only
four selection procedures giving advantage to sites in need of more urgent work.
However, the authorities in the Member States required beneficiaries to follow quality
standards, as defined in the national legislation, on the works to be performed during
project implementation in 13 of the 21 audited selection procedures (see Annex V).
The ERDF Regulation requires the existence of national or regional risk
assessments for disaster management, taking into account climate change adaptation.
This is a condition for the effective and efficient use of ERDF funds from the thematic
objective on promoting climate change adaptation, risk prevention and management.
The ERDF framework does not require Member States to integrate heritage sites,
which are the cultural sites more exposed to natural hazards, into their national or
regional risk assessments. A recent Commission’ study stated in that regard that
“safeguarding cultural heritage from natural and manmade disasters still suffers from
the fact that cultural heritage is not fully considered, or integrated, as a risk
management priority in emergency situations” 47. The Commission, together with
Member States, addressed this concern, in December 2019, by developing Reporting
Guidelines on Disaster Risk Management that include references to cultural heritage
sites, encouraging Member States to report, map and inform on the potential impact
of disaster risks on cultural heritage 48. It still remains to be seen how these guidelines
will be implemented by the Member States.
There is a trade-off between sustainable tourism and the economic and social
objectives of heritage sites
The generation of socio-economic impact with ERDF investments in cultural sites
is mainly tackled by Member States with tourism promotion strategies (see
paragraph 56). The effects of those investments are measured by an “increase in the
number of visitors to the sites” (see paragraph 66). Those strategies might be
counterproductive to the preservation of heritage sites that already face the problem
of mass tourism. Site degradation due to mass tourism for heritage sites was a risk
identified by 38 % of the heritage site managers who replied to our survey (see
Figure 4). Some of the visited projects have already implemented measures to restrict
the number of tourists or to manage tourist flows in a more sustainable manner (see
Box 7).

Example of measures taken to control the impact of overtourism
The early eighteenth-century Joanine Library is one of the jewels of the University
of Coimbra in Portugal, one of the world’s oldest universities and part of the
UNESCO heritage list. It was designed with architectural features that allow the
conservation of the bibliographic works it contains by maintaining a constant level
of temperature and humidity. With daily tourist visits and the frequent opening of
the massive teak main entrance door, the interior temperature and dust level
regularly vary, impacting the long-term preservation of the ancient, and often
rare, bibliographic works it contains.
To reduce the effects of touristic visits, the University of Coimbra changed the
main entrance point to the site. Entry is also limited to groups of a maximum of 60
people, in slots of 20 minutes, and time spent on the main floor is limited to 10
minutes. The University also recently acquired an anoxia chamber, which restores
humidity levels and disinfests books of fungi and parasites without the use of
chemicals.

In these cases, priority should be given to the preservation of a site, regardless of
its immediate economic and social effect. Currently, though, if action on a site is not
expected to produce such effects, the ERDF cannot fund it, even if urgent work is
required (see paragraphs 56 to 61). Nor can the Creative Europe Programme. This was
in the past possible, with the Raphael programme 49 that ran from 1997 to 2000 and
whose objectives included conservation, safeguarding and development of European
cultural heritage.
The EU has recently increased efforts to ensure preservation of cultural heritage
In the aftermath of the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in 2019, the 28
culture ministers of the EU Member States called for the creation of a European
network dedicated to the safeguarding of European heritage, and agreed that
protection matters should be addressed by EU policies 50.
The Commission indirectly addresses risk mitigation on heritage sites through
environmental and energy performance regulations. Member States have been
required, since 2012, to assess the effects on heritage sites of public and private
projects with significant effects on the environment 51. Since 2018, Member States shall
encourage, “in relation to buildings undergoing major renovations, (…) fire safety and
risks related to intense seismic activity” 52.
In the framework of the EYCH, the Commission launched an initiative for heritage
at risk, under which it performed a comparative analysis of risk management practices
in the EU, aiming to share experiences and foster cooperation between Member States
to address the effects of natural or human-made disasters on cultural heritage (see
paragraph 73). Also under the EYCH, an expert group led by ICOMOS, developed
quality principles for EU-funded projects that have a potential impact on cultural
heritage 53. The Commission has not yet established a position on how or whether
these principles will be taken on board at EU level.

The audited cultural sites are generally dependent on public subsidies and have little
incentive to increase revenues
The audited cultural sites are generally dependent on public subsidies
We analysed the self-financing rates of the cultural sites whose ERDF projects had
been completed. Self-financing rates are the proportion of operational costs that are
supported by the revenues generated by the operational activities of the site (“own
resources”). We consider a site to be financially self-sufficient if the own revenues are
higher or equal to operational costs. We based our assessment on the 2018 financial
accounts of the sites.
Except for three projects, none of the 21 audited cultural sites, for which data
was available, was financially self-sufficient in 2018. Cultural sites rely predominantly
on public subsidies to operate. Private donations exist but remain marginal. In eight of
the 11 cultural sites that received donations in 2018, donations covered less than 3 %
of total annual operating costs for each of those sites.
Cultural sites also rely heavily on subsidies to finance their investment costs. For
of the 23 audited completed projects, the ERDF investment projects were entirely
financed from public funding (EU or national/local public entities). Only two of the
audited projects received private donations. This reliance on public subsidies poses a
risk to the sustained operation of the cultural sites, as public authorities may decrease
funding (see Box 8).
Box 8
Example of risks faced by cultural sites relying on public subsidies,
and the need to diversify revenue sources
The European Solidarity Centre of Gdańsk, in Poland, has been highly dependent
on public subsidies since it was founded in 2012. In 2019, the Polish Ministry of
Culture and National Heritage reduced its contribution to the cultural site. The
solidarity centre had to undertake crowd-funding campaigns on social media to
remain financially sustainable and to be able to continue its normal activities.
According to the Centre, these changes in public support do not endanger the
site’s existence, but would have made it necessary for it to make significant
changes to its activities.
Revenue-generation is not sufficiently incentivised by the current funding framework
The 2014-2020 CPR requires that beneficiaries have the financial capacity to
implement the funded project 54. For projects that generate net revenue, the CPR also
requires beneficiaries to forecast the stream of revenues and costs generated by the
EU project to identify the part of the investment costs, if any, which needs to be
financed by EU funds55. The proposal for the 2021-2027 CPR requires Member States
to examine whether beneficiaries have sufficient resources to cover operational and
maintenance costs56.
The financial sustainability of projects is, therefore, a criterion frequently used by
managing authorities: it is required in 20 of the 21 selection procedures we audited,
either for projects to be potentially eligible for EU funding in the first place (i.e. as an
admissibility criterion) or for awarding points when selecting projects (i.e. as a
selection criterion) - see Annex V.
Managing authorities considered the visited projects to be financially sustainable
because of the existence of an institutional support framework that, in principle,
guarantees their financial sustainability. However, in the vast majority of cases, the
actual self-financing rates are lower than initially forecast in the project application
(see Figure 5). Three years after project completion, only two of the 16 audited
cultural sites for which data was available achieved their initial forecasts, and six saw
their self-financing rates reduced by more than half. This is explained by different

factors, such as over-optimistic financial forecasts, or major changes in the economic
model planned for the cultural site.

The ERDF framework does not incentivise beneficiaries to increase their revenue.
The ERDF requirements for revenue-generating projects imply that the higher the net
revenues generated by the project are, the less EU support is given 57. However, in four
visited heritage sites, the stream of revenues and costs forecasted had limited
relevance. This was because EU investments targeted specific parts of the cultural site
See also paragraph 97 of ECA Opinion No 6/2018.
(e.g. a roof, or a particular room) to which part of the total costs and revenues of the
site needs to be attributed, and these attributions were based on estimations and
assumptions that were not always clear.
In addition, revenue-generating activities were seldom incentivised in the
selection procedures we audited. Only in one case could applicants receive up to 3
points if their project increased its current proportion of privately sourced funding. All
interviewed national experts stated that cultural sites were not exploring the full
potential of revenue-generating activities, such as creating gift shops, renting out
space, developing ticketing strategies, or increasing patronage (see Table 4).

At project level, the capacity and incentive of the audited cultural sites to
diversify their own revenues was still, in many cases, affected by legal and financial
constraints. According to the experts we interviewed, cultural sites often face
contradictory incentives. For example, generating additional revenues might lead to
subsequent cuts in public funding. On average, cultural sites that have administrative
and financial autonomy have higher self-financing rates (see Figure 6).

There is a trade-off between financial sustainability and the attainment of cultural and
social objectives
Financial constraints imply a need to make choices. Those choices may result in
lower investments in the preservation of the physical infrastructure, in a decrease in
the range of cultural activities provided, or in restrictions on access to the cultural site
caused by a need to increase entrance fees. There is a balance to be found between
what is expected from cultural sites at a social and cultural level, and what cultural
sites can effectively address (see Box 9).
Box 9
Combining access to culture and financial stability
The Louvre-Lens museum granted free access to its permanent exhibition (the
“Time Gallery”) and to one its temporary exhibition halls (“the Glass Pavilion”) to
improve access to culture and diversify audiences. This measure increased,
according to the museum, the overall number of visitors58 (14 % of the visitors
would not have visited the museum had they had to pay an entrance fee) but
limited its financial autonomy by decreasing its self-financing rate 59 (18 % instead
of an expected 27 %). Free admissions have so far been maintained thanks to the
local authorities’ legal commitment to cover the site’s operating deficit.

Project monitoring by Member States is limited after project completion
The legal basis60 requires beneficiaries to maintain the nature and objectives of
the EU project for a five-year durability period. A breach of these obligations may lead
to financial corrections and the recovery of the EU funds granted. The EU legal
framework does not define how the managing authorities in the Member States must
ensure compliance with these requirements. It is the Member States’ responsibility to
define adequate monitoring arrangements.
The managing authorities monitor the projects mainly during the implementation
phase. Even though around one quarter of the result indicators defined for the
completed projects in our sample did not reach their targets at project completion (see
also Figure 3), beneficiaries were not subject to any financial consequences. We have
already stated, in a previous report, that incentive mechanisms should be applied and
lead to real financial benefits or sanctions 61. ICOMOS stated that monitoring
procedures set by the EU and the Member States for EU-funded projects take
insufficient account of the inherent specificities of the cultural sector and give too
much emphasis to financial aspects without properly assessing the actual quality and
cultural impact of projects (see Box 10)

Example of the lack of focus given to cultural aspects
The World Heritage Site of Pompeii was granted ERDF funds of around €78 million
to safeguard and promote it. Works were performed at different locations of the
site. We sampled for the audit visit the house of Efebo, which was finished in
December 2015.
The interventions carried out at the house included restorations works at the
summer triclinium, a Roman dining room overlooking the garden below a pergola
supported by four columns. The managing authority visited the house of Efebo to
verify the expenditures declared. The report confirmed that the works had been
finalised.
Three years after the completion of the works, the structure was damaged in a
number of places. During a monitoring check performed by the beneficiary,
experts concluded that the structure was undermined by the very high number of
visitors that had access to the triclinium and by the absence of protection on all
sides of the structure. A polycarbonate protection device was financed by the
audited ERDF project, but had been stored in a warehouse and not installed. It
was installed at the beginning of 2019 during maintenance works, three years
after project completion. This error damaged the physical infrastructure of the
summer triclinium.

After project completion, the monitoring systems of the visited Member States
do not ensure that project performance is systematically checked. During the five-year
durability period, performance can be checked on an ad-hoc basis, at national
discretion, and after this period, project performance is no longer monitored.
At project level, only one of the visited cultural sites had been the subject of an
ex-post assessment to analyse the economic, social or cultural impact of the ERDF
project.
For cultural heritage sites, the ERDF monitoring arrangements clearly contrast
with the arrangements in place for UNESCO, the Cultural Route of the Council of
Europe, and with the Commission itself for sites with the European heritage label.
Despite providing funds, the ERDF does not require frequent monitoring after project
completion. The Member States’ practices in that regard vary largely during the
five-year durability period. For the 2014-2020 programme period, whereas two of the
visited Member States monitor some projects on the spot, one only performs
administrative checks based on reports submitted by the beneficiaries. In contrast, the
afore mentioned international labels require monitoring to be performed on a
systematic basis, even though not necessarily providing funds (see Annex VII).
Conclusions and recommendations
Overall the audit concluded that there is no appropriate framework to ensure the
effectiveness and sustainability of its ERDF investments in cultural sites.
Lack of focus and limited coordination for EU investments in cultural
sites
The Treaties set an overarching objective for the EU to respect its rich cultural
diversity and ensure that Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced.
Culture is mainly a competence of the Member States. The Union can only encourage
cooperation between Member States and support or supplement their actions
(paragraphs 05 to 16).
Culture is not addressed in the EU 2020 overarching Commission strategy. The
core EU strategic framework for culture is composed of common strategic objectives
guiding EU action in the area of culture, set out in the Commission’s Agendas for
culture, and is developed in the Council’s Work Plans for Culture. This framework is
complex. It co-exists within multiple general EU strategic frameworks and objectives
with overlapping periods and several layers of responsibility. The strategic objectives
defined by the Commission are not translated into clear operational objectives, there
are no provisions to monitor the achievement of objectives set or indicators to
measure progress. According to the Commission translating objectives into policy
making at Member State level remains a challenge (paragraphs 17 to 22).
The strategic framework for culture is also only partially reflected in EU funding.
Cultural aspects are incorporated, or “mainstreamed”, into different policies, and are
mainly seen as a resource to help achieve other EU priorities and objectives through
different EU funds. However, from the 12 EU funds with the potential to support
culture that we analysed, only Creative Europe regulation, a small fund in terms of
budget, refers to the Commission’s 2007 Agenda. This puts the usefulness of the
Agenda into question (paragraphs 23 to 24).
The Commission has been developing numerous initiatives to promote cultural
sites, but EU cultural initiatives have a very limited impact on the availability of ERDF
funds to beneficiaries. The ERDF Regulation sets higher funding limits for UNESCO
sites, but no such provisions exist for cultural sites that have an EU label or participate
in an EU cultural initiative. In addition, coordination between the EU funds themselves
for investments in cultural sites is very limited (paragraphs 25 to 36).
At EU level, infrastructural investments are mainly funded through the ERDF. The
ERDF is an important source of funding for investments in cultural sites for around one
third of Member States. However, investments in cultural sites are not treated as a
priority for the ERDF, which supports a different Treaty objective, that of promoting
social and economic cohesion. We found examples of initiatives taken by Member
States to finance cultural sites and developing funding schemes that built on private
funds (paragraphs 37 to 51).
Recommendation 1 – Improve the current strategic framework
for culture within the remit of the Treaties
The Commission, bearing in mind its competences, should propose to the
Member States to set clear strategic and operational objectives in the next Work
Plan for Culture. These objectives should be regularly monitored through
indicators with targets and milestones.
Responsibilities for the implementation of these objectives should be defined and
allocated, including an appropriate level of coordination within the Commission.
The Commission should identify and provide good practices to stakeholders on
how to design, choose, fund, implement and monitor/follow up EU-funded
cultural projects. In particular, this could include the setup of maintenance plans,
the development of social activities, and the participation of cultural sites in EU
initiatives.
Time frame: by December 2022.
Recommendation 2 – Encourage the use of private funds to
safeguard Europe’s cultural heritage
To better address the EU Treaty objective of safeguarding European cultural heritage:
The Commission should collect good practices on alternative sources of funding
from the Member States.
The Commission should explore in coordination with the Member States the
possibility to develop a scheme that builds on private sources of funding for
heritage sites.
The Commission should coordinate such potential initiatives with other EU
cultural initiatives (e.g. European heritage label, ECoC)
Time frame: by December 2022
Mixed effectiveness and sustainability of audited ERDF projects
Despite the EU’s ambition to increase the social impact of cultural
interventions, the objectives of the ERDF OPs and projects are mostly economic.
Investments in cultural sites are treated as a resource to improve competitiveness or
to develop local areas. Cultural aspects are the least addressed in the audited OPs,
even when they are clearly referred to as objectives. Cultural aspects are often not
considered as relevant by the ERDF managing authorities when selecting projects
(paragraphs 52 to 61).
Project performance could not be assessed for all completed audited projects.
The projects were operational at the time of the audit, but we found several
weaknesses in the selection and reporting of indicators that limit the ability to use the
reported data to conclude on project performance. In addition, due to the nature of
ERDF result indicators, the achievement of OP objectives does not always directly
depend on individual project performance (paragraphs 62 to 67).
The ERDF requirements do not address the physical preservation of funded
cultural sites. Despite the constant need of heritage sites for maintenance and the
several risks they face to their preservation, none of the audited ERDF projects was
required to demonstrate how the cultural site would be preserved after project
completion or to present a maintenance plan when applying for EU funds. In addition,
the ERDF cannot fund the preservation of endangered sites unless the work involved is
expected to have an immediate economic and social effect; neither can Creative
Europe. This was possible in the past with the previous EU fund Raphael. For the sites
that already face the problem of mass tourism, the generation of economic impact,
often performed through tourism promotion strategies, could be counterproductive to
their preservation (paragraphs 68 to 75).
The EU has recently increased efforts to ensure preservation of cultural
heritage. However, at Member State level, the ERDF framework does not require
Member States to integrate heritage sites, which are the cultural sites most exposed to
natural hazards, into the national or regional risk assessment required by EU legislation
(paragraphs 76 to 78).
The audited cultural sites are generally dependent on public subsidies to
operate and to finance their investment costs. The ERDF framework does not
incentivise beneficiaries to increase their revenue. The ERDF requirements for
revenue-generating projects imply that the higher the net revenues generated by the
project are, the less EU support is given. Revenue-generating activities were also
seldom incentivised in the selection procedures we audited (paragraphs 79 to 88).
Project monitoring is limited after project completion. The monitoring systems
of the visited Member States allow project performance to be checked on an ad-hoc
basis during the five-year durability period required by EU law, but after this period,
project performance is no longer monitored. In addition, project performance did not
affect the amount of ERDF funds received by beneficiaries in any of the audited
projects (paragraphs 89 to 93).
Recommendation 3 – Strengthen the financial sustainability of
cultural sites funded by the ERDF
In order not to deter beneficiaries from increasing their own revenues, the
Commission should examine and propose simplified forms of support for ERDF
investments in cultural sites.
To decrease the dependence on public subsidies, ERDF financing should favour, at
project selection phase, projects that contain plans to improve the financial selfsustainability of cultural sites (e.g. diversification of and increased reliance on own
revenue sources).
Time frame: in time for the negotiations of operational programmes for the 20212027 programme period.
Recommendation 4 – Take more specific action to preserve
heritage sites
The Commission, when negotiating operational programmes, should recommend
Member States to include heritage sites in the national or regional disaster risk
management plan required by the proposed Common Provisions Regulation. This
would encourage them to identify the preservation risks that heritage sites face, and
plan appropriate mitigation measures.
Time frame: in time for the negotiations of operational programmes for the 20212027 programme period.

REPLIES OF THE COMMISSION TO THE SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN
COURT OF AUDITORS
“EU INVESTMENTS IN CULTURAL SITES: A TOPIC THAT DESERVES MORE FOCUS
AND COORDINATION”
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
VI: Second indent - The strategic framework for cultural policy in the European Union, as designed
by the European Commission (cf “New European Agenda for Culture” in particular), focuses on the
contribution that culture makes to Europe’s societies, economies and international relations. It does
not specifically concentrate on the promotion of cultural sites.
The ERDF investments into restoration of cultural sites often enable these sites to subsequently
participate in EU level cultural initiatives.
Third indent: The primary objective of ERDF is to contribute to reinforcing economic, social and
territorial cohesion. According to paragraph 11 of the preamble to the ERDF Regulation, the rationale
for the eligibility from ERDF funding of culture and support for cultural heritage is depending on
their inclusion in a territorial strategy for specific area or to the extent to which they contribute to
employment-friendly growth.
In addition, culture is an area of primary competence of the Member State where the European
Commission has to observe the subsidiarity principle.
VII: ERDF OPs and projects have mostly economic and social objectives in line with the legal base
for Cohesion Policy in the Treaty.
VIII: a) The Commission accepts the recommendation.
The Commission accepts the recommendation.
The Commission accepts the recommendation.
The Omnibus regulation which entered into force in 2018 already introduced further simplified cost
options possibilities for the ERDF co-funding and these possibilities were even widened in the
Commission’s post 2020 proposals.
As per the Commission’s proposal, managing authorities need to verify that beneficiaries have the
necessary financial resources and mechanisms to cover operation and maintenance costs.
The Commission accepts the recommendation.
OBSERVATIONS
The strategic framework for EU action reflects the Treaties and the supporting role of the EU in
relation to culture. Furthermore, the current report solely analyses the funding available for cultural
infrastructure projects (i.e. ESIF), while the assumption made here concerns EU funding overall.
In the case of ERDF investments, the objective is socio-economic development. Any investments
with a cultural dimension have to contribute to attaining this objective. The framework for ERDF
support is set out in Annex I to the CPR
The Commission distinguishes between an EU framework for investments in cultural sites and an EU
framework for EU action in culture.
There is only one EU strategic framework for culture, which is the New European Agenda for
Culture.
The only EU fund specifically for culture is the Creative Europe Programme, which does take the
current EU agenda for culture into account.
Other EU funds have other objectives and depend on other policy strategies.
None of the existing EU “labels” for culture was designed in view of triggering later EU funding.
The Commission’s cultural initiatives and the ERDF funding have their distinct objectives, they are
not conditional to each other.
The European Heritage label and other Commission initiatives, such as the European Capital of
Culture, are often awarded to cities / sites that previously benefitted from ERDF investments. This
ERDF support enabled them to subsequently obtain the “label”. A good example for this is Wroclaw,
which became thanks to ERDF investments in 2007-13 period the European Capital of Culture 2016.
The definition of criteria for the selection of projects and the selection is under the responsibility
of the Member States. The monitoring committee shall examine and approve the methodology and
criteria used for selection of operations (Article 110(2)a CPR).
The different EU funds are designed to complement each other. As regards ESI Funds under
shared management, the Member States had to set out in the Partnership Agreements “arrangements,
in line with the institutional framework of the Member States, that ensure coordination between the
ESI Funds and other Union and national funding instruments and with the EIB (Article 15(1)b(i)
CPR).
The requirement to put in place arrangements that ensure coordination between the ESI Funds and
other Union and national funding instruments and with the EIB does not imply that detailed
coordination mechanisms for each specific type of investment financed by the ESI Funds are to be
established. This concerns in particular investments such as the support to cultural sites, which are of
limited size in most ERDF programmes.
See Commission reply to paragraph 23.
The Common Provisions Regulation requires Member States to report financial data to the
Commission in a systematic manner for the ERDF (template tables for regular reporting are set out in
Commission Implementing Regulation).
There is no EU regulation specifically on cultural statistics. The majority of the EU statistics on
culture are derived from different surveys and data collections which are regulated (compulsory), e.g.
EU-Labour Force Survey, Structural Business Statistics, National Accounts. However, cultural items
cannot always be distinguished separately in the results of these surveys (i.e. details relevant for
culture are not available in data transmitted to Eurostat).
The Commission recalls that the ERDF is not intended to provide any such framework for cultural
sites.
The Commission stresses that defining frameworks for investments in cultural sites is not an EU
competence, but a competence of the Member States.
The Commission notes that the restriction to small-scale cultural infrastructure was not part of the
Commission’s proposal for the current ERDF Regulation (COM(2011) 614 final) but was introduced
by the co-legislators in the negotiations with the European Parliament and the Council.
The Commission has to prioritise the investments for culture compared to other sectors like
transport or environment and ensure that conditions are in place in order to maximise their effects, the
reason why it may lead to some reductions.
The Commission stresses that it may only require the Member States to design their PAs and OPs
in line with the Regulations as approved by the co-legislators. The CPR requires the Member States to
use the ESIF to effectively contribute to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive
growth. It does not require any alignment with any cultural agenda.
The Commission considers that the effectiveness of ERDF investments can only be assessed
against the ERDF objectives: promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion.
The focus of the ERDF funded projects depends on the Thematic Objective (TO) under which
they are funded. TO1-3 are indeed focussed on growth and competitiveness. However, cultural
projects under TO6, were aiming at preserving and protecting the environment and promoting
resource efficiency. Or if an investment was under TO9 (e.g. for access to cultural services), it
focussed on promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination.
Common reply 63 and 64
The Commission underlines that even though some result indicators were not reached at the time the
underlying projects ended, they may be reached at the time the respective programmes were closed, as
it takes time for results to materialise.
The Commission notes that there are regulatory requirements for setting result indicators at priority
axes but not at project level.
The Commission stresses that the 2014-2020 programming period has introduced more stringent
requirements for the reporting of performance data. National and EU audits are carried out on systems
used to collect, verify and report indicators. Unreliability of performance data is considered as a
weakness in the management and control system and may lead to suspension of payments.
The Commission considers that event though there is still room for improvement, these are important
steps and a strong incentive for programme authorities towards enhanced reliability.
The Commission notes that in some cases, a partial restoration was a necessity in the sense that a
non-intervention could have led to close the site, therefore increasing the number of visitors is not
always an end in itself.
The ERDF common indicator “increase in expected number of visits to supported sites of cultural or
natural heritage and attraction” expresses the ex-ante estimated increase in number of visits to a site in
the year following project completion. The managing authorities set the methodology for estimating
the expected number that can be based on demand analysis. The managing authorities are not
supposed to report the actual number of visitors under this common indicator.
Under shared management, the Commission monitors aggregated outputs and results at the level
of programmes and priorities. There is no regulatory requirement for setting result indicators at
project level. A well-designed intervention logic shall ensure that outputs and results at project level
contribute to achieving the expected results of the operational programmes, which are also influenced
by external factors. This is why the Commission considers that assessing the contribution of projects
to the programme objectives expressed by their result indicators cannot be measured through the
performance of individual projects, but requires an impact evaluation.
The Commission shares this concern and reminds that there is a legal obligation for the
beneficiary to repay the EU contribution in case of a substantial change in the operation within five
years of the final payment to the beneficiary (Article 71 CPR). In this sense, the failure to maintain a
restored cultural site could constitute a substantial change in the implementation conditions of the
operation undermining the original objectives of the ERDF investment.
The allocation of ERDF to projects is driven by the objectives of cohesion policy, and by the
specific objectives formulated by the operational programmes, which are mostly not culture oriented.
The Commission stresses that it does not have the powers to go beyond the reporting requirements
set out in Article 6 of Decision No 1313/2013/EU on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism. This
requires Member States to make available to the Commission summaries of their risk assessments and
risk management capability assessments focusing on key risks identified at national (or regional)
level.
The common indicator “increase in the number of visitors to the sites” is only used by the
operational programmes when it is relevant for the operations supported. The ERDF support does not
prevent national authorities to apply measures for the preservation of heritage sites.
See Commission reply to paragraph 17.
This issue is also mentioned in State aid exemption rules, which have to be respected as of 2014
when granting ERDF support. In particular, those rules state that for investment in culture and
heritage conservation, the aid amount shall not exceed the difference between the eligible costs and
the operating profit of the investment.
The non-achievement of the results indicators for projects under the 2007-2013 ERDF
programmes, did not entail any financial consequences, because such a provision was not included in
2007-2013 Regulations. Under shared management the incentive mechanisms referred to by the
European Court of Auditors can only be applied in the contractual arrangements between the project
beneficiary and the managing authority.
The Common Provisions Regulation require ERDF co-financed operations to maintain their
nature, objectives and implementation conditions for a period of at least 5 years starting from the final
payment to the beneficiary. The compliance with this regulatory provision is monitored by the
Member States.
The current requirement for the evaluation of impacts of all ERDF interventions incentivises Member
States to adopt a medium to long-term perspective when planning and programming the
implementation of the interventions, therefore catering implicitly also to the durability of the
investment results. The direct monitoring of the durability of project results, however, remains the
responsibility of Member States.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Commission notes that EU labels/initiatives are often awarded to the sites that have been
newly built or renovated thanks to ERDF funding.
Recommendation 1 – Improve the current strategic framework for culture within the remit of
the Treaties
The Commission accepts the recommendation.
Recommendation 2 – Encourage the use of private funds to safeguard Europe’s cultural
heritage
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The ERDF regulation does not address the physical preservation of funded cultural sites as an
independent objective. In addition, without being embedded in a national or regional development
strategy, the ERDF cannot fund the preservation of endangered sites.
The Commission notes that the Common Provisions Regulation does not require a monitoring of
the project performance after the regulatory five-year durability period. The current requirement for
the evaluation of impacts of all ERDF interventions incentivises Member States to adopt a medium to
long-term perspective when planning and programming the implementation of the interventions,
therefore catering implicitly also to the durability of the investment results. The direct monitoring of
the durability of project results, however, remains the responsibility of Member States.
Applying incentive and sanctioning schemes depending on project performance falls under national
competence.
Recommendation 3 – Strengthen the financial sustainability of cultural sites funded by the
ERDF
The Commission accepts the recommendation.
The Omnibus regulation which entered into force in 2018 already introduced further simplified cost
options possibilities for the ERDF co-funding and these possibilities were even widened in the
Commission’s post 2020 proposals.
As per the Commission’s proposal, managing authorities need to verify that beneficiaries have the
necessary financial resources and mechanisms to cover operation and maintenance costs.
Recommendation 4 – Take more specific action to preserve heritage sites
The Commission accepts the recommendation.

In the field of Culture, the overarching objective for the EU, as set
in the Treaty, is to respect its rich cultural diversity and ensure
that Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced.
Culture being mainly a competence of the Member States, the
Union can only encourage cooperation between them and
support or supplement their actions.
We assessed the economic, social and cultural effects of ERDF
investments in cultural sites and the financial and physical
sustainability of those sites. We examined the work of the
Commission and assessed 27 projects from seven Member States.
The audit concluded that the current framework lacks focus and
needs more coordination to ensure the effectiveness and
sustainability of its ERDF investments in cultural sites.
