Remarks by High Representative Valentin Inzko to the United
Nations Security Council
Check against delivery.
Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Council,
Before I start, I would like to take a moment to remember Lord Paddy Ashdown, who passed away in December. As
High Representative, Lord Ashdown led the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina through a critical
period, implementing key provisions of the General Framework Agreement for Peace, building and strengthening
the institutions crucial to reintegrating the country and its peoples.
Lord Ashdown was quoted as saying of Bosnia and Herzegovina, “It’s the place you cannot leave behind.”
And he showed this to be true. Until the very end of his life, even just days before his passing, Lord Ashdown
remained a vocal advocate for the country, and a champion of multilateralism in an increasingly complex world.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Last November, I reported to this Council on how the October 7 General Elections had deﬁned the political events
of the previous months. Now, seven months on from those elections, the process of building coalitions and
appointing governments continues to dominate the political dynamic in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
While Republika Srpska and some Federation cantons moved swiftly to form Governments, regrettably, there has
been no appointment of a new State-level Council of Ministers or a new Federation Government.
Nevertheless, concrete discussions among parties on a state-level coalition appear to be more advanced now, as
conﬁrmed in my contacts with key political players before my departure.
The international community expects a new Council of Ministers to be formed as quickly as possible, focused on a
forward-looking agenda of reforms.
Over the last six months, we have continued to see a positive consensus across the political spectrum on the need
for further integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the European Union.
This was reﬂected in February, when the Council of Ministers ﬁnalized the follow-up responses to the European
Commission Questionnaire and in March when BiH Presidency Chair Milorad Dodik personally delivered the answers
in Brussels. As you know there were almost 4,000 questions.
Despite this positive political step, we have also seen a continuation of divisive and destabilizing rhetoric,
sometimes from the very same leaders who profess a commitment to the country’s EU path.
This inconsistency poses a serious challenge to BiH. While Presidency Chair Dodik has worked with his fellow
Presidency Members to ﬁnd agreement on several important issues, he continues to speak against the statehood
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to threaten the future secession of Republika Srpska and to assert that Republika
Srpska is a state, for example most recently saying that, “…we are already separated. It just hasn’t been
proclaimed yet.”
He has also stated that if Kosovo becomes a member of the United Nations, Republika Srpska would declare
independence. To illustrate his intentions, he has on more than one occasion displayed a map of Serbia joined with
Republika Srpska and a part of Montenegro as a single state.
It is my duty to warn you of potential developments. But I would also ask the distinguished members of the
Security Council: How might you react if a regional representative in your own country made such explicit
statements and declared part of your country an independent state?
The secessionist rhetoric and the longstanding policy of challenging the state of BiH unfortunately became a
constant over the last several years. I believe therefore we should push back on these negative trends more
decisively.
In addition to separatist statements from some Republika Srpska political representatives, the main Croat parties
persistently reject the judgements of international courts concerning their wartime leadership and seek to revive
the structures of that period’s para-state. To be clear, they are rejecting the judgements of an international court,
the ICTY, which was created by this very body, the Security Council, in a unanimous vote, in 1993.
Also, earlier this year, the main Bosniak party announced its intention to launch an initiative to challenge the name
of Republika Srpska before the BiH Constitutional Court, which predictably led to further threats of secession.
In this context, I must stress that the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina establishes that the state of Bosnia
and Herzegovina consists of two entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. The
international community remains unwavering in its commitment to the territorial integrity and fundamental
structure of BiH.
I am grateful to Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron for organizing the recent Berlin meeting of Balkan leaders
affirming the international community’s resolve in this regard.
In contrast to statements from the BiH Presidency Chair challenging the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
supporting the independence of Republika Srpska, I must acknowledge with pleasure that President Vucic of Serbia
has continued to express respect for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, most recently that the opening of the Mostar fair on April 9 , and following the recent Berlin conference.
Another issue that recently emerged and has raised tensions is the possibility of reserve police forces being
created in the entities. In April, the Republika Srpka National Assembly moved forward with legislation to create a
reserve police force, whose purpose has been variously explained as a response to public security challenges
associated with migration or to respond to natural disasters.
This move, interpreted by some as an attempt to build an alternative military force, raised grave concerns in the
Federation. In response, the competent parliamentary committee in the Federation has said it would do the same.
The issue has also been seen in the light of the previous controversy over the disproportionate purchases of longbarrel weapons by the RS police.
Recently, a member of the main board of the ruling party in the RS wrote that the reserve police is “a replacement
for the Army of Republika Srpska.”
The current political discourse related to “reserve” police forces in the entities, which began with the unilateral
step taken by the RS, does not contribute to peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On the contrary, it has generated a negative spiral of mistrust and unhealthy competition. If the current dynamic
escalates further, it could create tensions and divisions, destabilizing the country.
Bosnia needs less weapons and less people in police uniforms, not more. We must do all we can to prevent a police
arms race.
Instead, authorities at all levels should work towards better cooperation in order to maximize public security and a
safe environment for all citizens. Immigration, refugee and asylum policy are the constitutional responsibilities of
state institutions, and their capacities should be reinforced. This would be an appropriate example of better
cooperation, and I have made this clear in my public statements.
Given the region’s recent past, these matters deserve the continued attention of this Council.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
All that I have described today occurs against a backdrop in which the political leaders continue to avoid
obligations with respect to the rule of law, particularly, and persistently, failing to respect binding decisions of the
state judiciary.
I have previously mentioned the unimplemented decisions of the BiH Constitutional Court in the Ljubic case and on
the electoral system of the City of Mostar, the latter of which has prevented the organization of local elections
since 2008.
It is inconceivable that a major city in a country that aspires to join the European Union and to be the Cultural
Capital of Europe, has not held local elections for over a decade!
The Republika Srpska authorities continue to refuse to respect judgments of the BiH State Court and the BiH
Constitutional Court concerning the registration of defense property and the 9 January “RS Day” holiday.
Additionally, the authorities in several Federation cantons have failed to take necessary steps to ensure the
equality of Serbs in those cantons. In those cantons the Serbs do not exist in cantonal constitutions, so the
Constitutional Court has said that this has to be changed.
I must also highlight the failure of the authorities to implement decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in
the “Sejdic & Finci” and related cases, which leaves in place a system that discriminates against a signiﬁcant
number of citizens to exercise their right to stand for public oﬃce. They can all vote, but they cannot be elected.
It is now 24 years since Dayton and almost 10 years since the ECHR ﬁrst ruled on this issue, and representatives of
minority groups still cannot run for the state Presidency and the House of Peoples.
For this group of citizens, one of the most sacred principles of civilization, égalité, does not exist, for a quarter of a
century. This is unacceptable, and the authorities must act without delay to remedy the situation.
In the context of the rule of law, I must also report that following recent the decision to increase the sentence
against Radovan Karadzic, we again saw denials of the genocide committed in Srebrenica, even though it has been
conﬁrmed by two international tribunals, one being the ICTY, established by this body.
We have also witnessed efforts over the last six months to curb freedom of expression and dissent.
In December, the Republika Srpska authorities broke up the months-long daily protests in Banja Luka over what
activists alleged was a cover-up in the suspicious death of a young man and have impeded attempts to organize
new protests.
As the authorities have expressed intentions to amend legislation related to public gatherings and the work of
journalists, the international and NGO communities have spoken out against actions that would limit democratic
rights and freedoms. In this context, I welcome that the RS authorities have taken steps to reﬂect such concerns
with regard to the Law on Public Peace and Order, and I encourage continued dialogue on related initiatives.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
My intention today is to illustrate that Bosnia and Herzegovina still requires the attention and uniﬁed approach of
the international community.
We have long taken for granted that the great progress the country has made since 1995 and is somehow
irreversible. But it is important that we recognize backsliding when it occurs and acknowledge that our mission is
not yet complete.
The OHR is in BiH to ensure that the Dayton Peace Agreement, including the BiH Constitution, is respected, and
that the substantial reforms enacted to implement Dayton are not only maintained but completed. This
functionality is a logical precondition for the country to meet the challenges ahead, including the integration
aspirations supported by all major political parties.
For my part, I continue to focus on fulﬁlling my mandate in accordance with Annex 10 of the Peace Agreement and
relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. It is imperative to insist that the authorities remain focused on full
compliance, otherwise we risk encouraging further rollback of the reforms.
At the same time, I cannot govern in place of the elected leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only they can take
the steps necessary to move to the country forward.
So, I invite the political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina to exert sincere eﬀort to overcome their diﬀerences and
ﬁnally move forward with the appointment of the State and Federation executive authorities, and work with the
authorities of Republika Srpska and the cantons to fully implement the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Additionally, I implore the leaders to abandon the destabilizing and divisive rhetoric rooted in the past and take
strides to keep the country moving forward on the EU path, in the interests of all citizens whom they represent.
It is of particular importance to establish a positive socioeconomic environment and ensure rule of law in order to
stem the exodus of brilliant young people, the country’s most important natural resource.
Respected Members of the Security Council,
Citizens of Bosnian and Herzegovinian origin are now sitting in the parliament of Austria, in the House of Lords in
the United Kingdom and in at least one state legislature in the United States. Outstanding young people like them
who have remained in BiH represent hope for change and the future of BiH.
This is why I am ending with an optimistic tone, and also with Lord Ashdown’s quote that I mentioned at the outset:
Bosnia-Herzegovina is the place we cannot leave behind.
Thank you.
Speech by the High Representative for BiH Paddy Ashdown at a
conference on ‘Transition in Central and Eastern Europe:
Challenges of the 21st Century’ Organised by the University of
Sarajevo School of Economics
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,
You will, no doubt, have heard me talk before about the challenges that we face in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
about the things that we must, together, try to do.
Some of you will have heard me talk about my priorities: First Justice. Then Jobs. Through Reform.
Today I want to talk about the second part of that slogan – about the one thing that impacts most on the daily life
of every citizen of this country: our economy.
When he was running for President in the early 1990s, Bill Clinton’s campaign manager attached a large notice on
the wall of the Democratic Party Campaign Headquarters to keep the party’s activists ruthlessly focused and on
message in the hurly burly of the election campaign.
That notice said very simply: IT’S THE ECONOMY, STUPID!
No doubt without the last adjective, every incoming Minister could do worse than aﬃx such a message to their
office wall to remind them what really matters.
The challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina
Because this country must travel a very diﬃcult, steep, and tough road to economic success.
Some of the pitfalls are all too visible:
The lure of many of our best and brightest young people to enticing opportunities abroad.
The rampant crime and corruption that saps our economic strength and impoverishes our public services and those
who rely on them.
The worrying coincidence of declining aid ﬂows and rising debt.
The uncertain global economic outlook, which means that countries like this one have to work all the harder if they
are to attract foreign investment.
It is not the role of the High Representative to depress people unduly.
But it is my task to tell things as they are, not as we might like them to be.
How is the state of our economy?
A quick glance at the main economic indicators conﬁrms what anyone who has lived in BiH already knows.
Unemployment levels are very high – somewhere between 17 and 40 per cent depending on whether or not you
include the euphemistically titled ‘gray economy’.
Almost half the population lives close to the poverty line: one in ﬁve of our citizens live on less than 5KM a day –
one in four in the Republic Srpska.
Our national wealth stands at less than half its pre-war level.
Foreign direct investment is lower than anywhere in Central and Eastern Europe except Albania. Many of our
businesses are riddled with bad debts and liabilities, crippling their ability to expand and create jobs.
Even allowing for the ‘informal’ economic activity – the under-reporting of salary levels to avoid social insurance
payments, the scaling-down of company balance sheets to avoid sales and proﬁt tax, the hundreds of millions of
KM in unregistered money transfers from abroad – the economic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains,
allow me a little English understatement, depressingly ﬂat.
The reasons are many, but they all come down to one thing: we have not reformed anything like enough, or fast
enough.
Ask any businessman trying to get on, make a proﬁt and employ people in this country. From Citluk to Banja Luka
I have heard the same stories, the same concerns:
Fragmentation, mal-administration, regulation, taxation, inspection, corruption. A cacophony of complaints, too
many of them well founded.
Because instead of making it as easy as possible for businesses to start up, expand and hire staff, the laws, taxes
and governments of this country do the exact opposite.
That, frankly, is crazy.
Because this country has great assets. It is rich in human talent and potential, in a region poised for growth, on
the edge of the world’s biggest market.
Instead of snuﬃng out that talent with burdensome bureaucracy, your governments should be working night and
day to set it free.
So I say to every new Minister: each day, over your morning coﬀee, I hope you will ask yourself this question:
What can I do today to make this country a better place in which to do business and a more welcoming place for
foreign investors?
Ask yourself that question, because that is what Ministers in the most successful governments in the most
successful economies ask themselves every day, and do every day.
And what is the answer to that question?
The challenge for government
The ﬁrst thing is to be clear what governments can and cannot do.
In a market economy, governments cannot create jobs by decree. There is no magic wand marked ‘employment’
that I, or any government in this country, can wave around to create more jobs and better wages.
But governments can make a huge diﬀerence – both good and bad.
Good governments provide a legal framework that makes it easy for businesses to set up.
Good governments give them as simple – and as light – a tax structure as they can.
Good governments spend wisely, so as to keep to a minimum the amount they need to tax business to pay for
essential public services.
Good governments work hard to clear away obstacles, so business can operate as freely as possible in the market
place, at home and overseas.
And in doing these things, good governments create the conditions in which jobs occur naturally.
Bad governments do the opposite.
Bad governments spend proﬂigately, tax recklessly, legislate thoughtlessly, and entangle enterprise in a thicket of
red tape.
Bad governments pursuing bad policies don’t just fail to create jobs – they create systems that destroy jobs and
destroy livelihoods.
And, as too many of our citizens have discovered to their cost, no amount of hard work and toil will lift people up, if
we don’t ﬁrst change the system that keeps them down.
There has been progress.
The introduction of a single currency, the abolition of the payments system and the smooth functioning of the
Central Bank have all assisted in creating a stable, low-inﬂation, macro-economic framework.
The newly re-furbished Unis towers across the road where the HVB has set up its Bosnian headquarters testify to
progress.
But serious structural problems remain.
Exports are low, imports are high, and production is ﬂat.
We are not producing enough, not making enough, not selling enough.
We have more debt than proﬁt, more liabilities than assets, more consumption than production.
And to cap it oﬀ, we are heading towards a serious domestic debt crisis next spring, which could seriously
undermine our ability to maintain services and pay salaries.
There is one way out of this morass, and one way only – to step up the pace of reform.
We need a bonﬁre of bureaucracy. A revolution of reform. We need to drive a bulldozer through our systems to
sweep away the barriers that destroy business.
It means sorting out our system of government, making it leaner, cheaper and more eﬀective. And let me say this
to incoming governments. The quality of all Ministers is important. But the quality of Ministers of Finance, who
have oversight over the expenditure of public money and who are the guardians of this country’s reputation
abroad, is most important of all. We will be keeping a close eye on this.
It means reforming the public administration, making it transparent, responsive, and cost-eﬃcient.
It means sorting out our revenue system, introducing a modern VAT system organised at the State level and
reforming our rotten, corruption prone customs administrations.
When I outlined these steps last week I said they would test the next governments’ commitment to reform. So far,
with diﬀerent degrees of enthusiasm, everyone has expressed a willingness to engage in this process.
I will judge people not by their words, but by their actions. And I will return to these issues again, and again, and
again until solutions are agreed and reforms are implemented.
Because, as I said before, when so many people are struggling to pull themselves up, we cannot aﬀord systems
that conspire to keep them down.
That’s the challenge for the politicians of this country. To create the systems that will attract investment,
safeguard public funds, support business and encourage enterprise.
That is the Government’s side of the deal – to create the conditions, not just for survival, but for success.
The Challenge for Citizens
But the people of this country have an obligation too. There is no point creating the conditions for success, if our
people do not take the necessary risks to achieve it.
We can change our laws, reform our systems and provide a light-touch, modern regulatory framework, but we will
achieve nothing without the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina actively pursuing their dreams and striving to make
them real.
So what we need in this country is not just a big change in administrative culture, but a seismic shift in attitude
too.
After all, economies are only ever as dynamic as the people working within them. If we can engender a spirit of
enterprise in this country – a genuine willingness to take risks, to innovate and experiment – and combine it with a
tax and administrative framework that rewards the bold and those who work hard, then the economic growth we
all crave will not be long in coming.
Certainly the potential exists. Take for example, the ‘AlmaRas’ clothing factory near Olovo:
It opened in 1998 in the basement of a family home. Almase and Dzemal Memagic had come to the conclusion 
th
at there was no real future for them on the small salary they earned from the pre-war textile giant ‘OLI’. So they set
up on their own – they took a risk – and slowly but surely they expanded their operation and their proﬁts.
Today, Mr and Mrs Memagic employ 110 people.
Look also at the ‘Orto-Optic’ family ﬁrm in Laktasi, near Banja Luka:
This small, private company, which began as an opticians before branching into production of low-cost lenses, has
seen its sales rocket from 35,000 KM four years ago, to over half a million KM last year.
If this can happen in BiH today – if this can happen despite BiH today – just imagine what could be achieved once
we have cleared away the clutter of absurd regulation that makes this country one of the hardest places in the
world to do legitimate business.
So my message to the people of this country is simple:
Don’t allow your politicians to obstruct reform. But don’t wait for them either.
If you have an ambition, pursue it.
If you’ve spotted a niche in the market, ﬁll it.
If you’ve ever dreamt of starting a business, of running your own show, then get out there and make it happen.
And don’t feel you have to do everything on your own.
Already, across Bosnia and Herzegovina, economic development strategies are being implemented at the grassroots level.
Businesses are coming together locally to share facilities and cut costs.
Technology parks and industrial zones have been established.
Support structures for small and medium sized businesses have been set up.
Job placement schemes and vocational training opportunities have been initiated.
One-stop-shops for business registration have been organised.
And all of it by has been done by ordinary people, taking charge of their own destinies and shaping the future for
their own communities.
In more than 70 municipalities, local business people have come together with local Mayors to make things
happen. They haven’t waited for the senior politicians or the international community to do it for them.
Take the Brcko one-stop-shop for business support for example. This has already registered 160 new businesses,
provided a range of other support services to local businesses and in the process succeeded in attracting foreign
direct investment to the area.
Local action delivering real results.
Let’s learn from these initiatives – let’s learn from the progress made on the ground in half the municipalities of
this country.
Why not, for example, accelerate the establishment of a single system of business registration for all Bosnia and
Herzegovina? And why could that system not be up and running in the next few months? It would be rough and
ready – of course it would – but it could be done, and it must be done.
The truth is that the only thing that stands between our plans, and their implementation, is the political will to see
them through.
Peroration
As I said at the outset, we have a long, hard road ahead.
I cannot tell you when things will improve.
I cannot hide from you that there will be risks.
I cannot pretend that there will not be diﬃcult decisions to be made, and painful consequences in the short term.
But I can tell you this with absolute certainty.
If we keep doing what we’re doing, we’ll keep getting what we’ve got.
So if we want things to change, we have to make things change.
The longer we put it oﬀ, the harder it will be.
To those who are daunted by that task, I would say this.
Look around the rest of this continent.
Look at those who have embarked on this road before you, who have travelled this journey, and look where they
are now.
Take the Czech Republic, where health spending is now nearly USD1000 per person, or Poland, where it has
doubled in the last few years.
Take infant mortality, which has more than halved in both of those countries.
Take annual spending on education in these countries, which now stands at well over USD 3,000 per pupil – the
same level as in Ireland, one of the EU’s most successful economies.
Look at those countries, and take heart.
Because they show that reform is worth it.
They have transformed themselves, and the prospects of their citizens, through reform.
And so, I know, can this country, if – and it’s a big if – we are ready to make a start.
Speech by the PDHR and Brčko Supervisor Michael Scanlan on the
occasion of the Brčko District Day
Brčko, 8 March 2020
Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, let me congratulate you on this Brčko District Day.
In addition to the many local representatives and residents here today, let me acknowledge the BiH Presidency
member Džaferović, RS President Cvijanović, and Federation Prime Minister Novalić and other dignitaries as well as
representatives of our partners in the international community.
Just one year ago, I stood here and shared with you the vision of what Brčko could be. Since then, I have traveled
to Brčko each month, ever more encouraged by the many developments that are poised to make that vision a
reality.
I have found broad consensus that things must change, that Brčko’s unique advantages need to be harnessed so
as to restore in the young generation the faith that their future lies in the District.
This is understandable, as the District’s abundant resources often have been expended poorly. Despite having the
largest per-capita budget in the region, public buildings in Brčko have not been renovated to be energy eﬃcient.
To do so would have ensured that hospital rooms, school buildings and workplaces are always warm.
Renovation of the District’s 187 public buildings would cost approximately 28 million KM. That would have been
only 3.5 million KM per year over the last eight years, while at the same time creating ﬁnancial savings for the
budget.
But there is good news: In the last several months, the authorities have worked quickly to qualify for the UNDP-led
energy eﬃciency initiative. How rapidly Brčko moves forward is strictly a question of how the authorities choose to
use Brčko’s enormous budget of 256 million KM. This is just one example of how public oﬃcials can and should use
the resources provided by Brčko’s unique co-eﬃcient to invest in the future that the residents of the District
deserve.
This is not just about reversing the negative trends of the past years, but about taking decisions that will make
Brčko District one of the best environments to live and work in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On this Brčko District Day, I am pleased to say that the District leadership – Assembly Speaker Kadrić, Deputy
Speaker Filipović, Mayor Milić, and Deputy Mayor Domić – have all stepped up to the challenge to take charge of
the reform process. And that process – as they have recognized – requires not only political will, wisdom and
courage, but also a wide buy-in. It is only by everyone working together that progress can be made to revive this
once vibrant community.
This year it will be possible to see visible progress in Brčko if the authorities continue to adopt the necessary
legislation.
A good starting point is the new Law on Budget adopted last December as it provides for responsible, transparent
and targeted use of public funds. The District political establishment has an opportunity to demonstrate their
commitment to these values by using it to guide them in the adoption this month of the 2020 budget. The new law
on associations and foundations to be adopted this spring will also further contribute to these objectives, while the
summer should bring progress on a range of issues to stimulate economic activity in the District.
At the very least, this summer should see the commencement of construction works to modernize the Port, the
completion of key studies as the basis for the reconstruction of the Brčko-Gunja Bridge, and the adoption of a
range of business-friendly measures aimed at attracting investments, expanding businesses and generating jobs
as well as public revenue.
The ongoing reform eﬀorts I am talking about provide an opportunity for political parties and their representatives
to run their election campaigns this fall on a platform of tangible results, but that means the Government and
Assembly must work up to the elections.
At the same time, the citizens of the District must hold their elected oﬃcials accountable on delivering good
governance, which should be the sole criteria on which they cast their vote. Citizens should also call out and
demand accountability for corruption wherever they see it, and law enforcement and the judiciary must follow
through in such cases. In this regard, Brčko District should serve as a model for the rest of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
Most importantly, this long-awaited and crucial progress will restore a sense of hope and provide an incentive for
Brčko’s youth to stay, to open businesses and to raise their families here. Who would not want to live in a vibrant
economic community with good jobs, excellent infrastructure, and an array of cultural, sports, and entertainment
facilities?
So, let me once more congratulate the residents on this Brčko District Day, but let me also issue a challenge to the
District leadership to keep things moving in the right direction, in an atmosphere of tolerance and cooperation.
I believe all of you are up to the challenge, for the sake of this unique community.
Lastly, since today is also International Women’s Day, allow me to extend my congratulations to all the women of
Brčko, who are indispensable partners in building the District’s future.
Thank you.
