Lets get started with some problems
lets see
first problem what is
what is 15 percent of 40
the way i do percent problems is i just convert the
percentage to a decimal and then i multiply it times the
the number that i m trying to get the percentage of
so 15 percent as a decimal is point 1 5
you learned that from the for the um percent to decimal conversion
a video hopefully
and we just multiply this times 40 
so lets say 40 times fifth point 1 5
5 times 0 is 0
5 times 4 is 20
bring down
put a 0 there
and then 1 times 0 is 0
1 times 4 is 4
and you get 6 0 0
then you count the decimal spots
1 2
no decimals up there so you go 1 2 and 
you put the decimal there
so 15 percent of 40 is equal to point 1 5 times 40 which equals 6 point 0 0
well thats just the same thing as 6 
lets do another problem
hopefully that didnt confuse you too much
and im going to try to confuse you this time just
in case you werent properly confused the last time
what is point 2 percent of mmm let me think of a number of seven
so a lot of peoples inclinationt would just 
say oh point 2 percent thats the same thing as point 2
and if that was your inclination you would be wrong
cos remember this isnt point 2
this is point 2 percent
so there is 2 ways of thinking about this
you could say that this is point 2 over a 100 which is if you
multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 is the
same thing as 2 over a 1000
or you can just do the technique where you 
move the decimal space over 2 to the left
in which case if youre starting with point 2 you move
the decimal space 2 to the left you go bam
whoops
bam bam
thats where the decimal goes
thats point 0 0 2
this is key
point 2 percent is the same thing as point 0 0 2
this can always trip you up and ive ive made this careless mistake
all the time so dont feel bad if you ever do it
but just always pay carefull attention to your decimal
and a percentage at the same time
so now that weve figured out how to write this percentage
as the decimal we just have to multiply it times the number
that we want take the percentage of
so we say point 0 0 2 times 7 
well this is pretty straightforward
7 times 2 is 14 right
and how many totals numbers do we have or how many total
digits do we have behind the decimal point
lets see
its 1 2 3
so we need 1 2 3 digits behind the decimal point
so point 2 percent of 7 is equal to point zero 1 4
and youre probably thinking boy thats a really
really small number
and and it it makes sense because point 2 percent thats y if you 
if you wanna think about it thats smaller than even 1 percent
so thats even smaller than 1 100th
and actually if you think about it point 2 percent is 1 500th
so and if you do the math 7 1 500th of 7
will turn out to be this number
and thats thats an important thing to do
is always good to do a reality check because when
youre going this decimal or these ehm um percent problems
its very easy to uhm kind of lose a factor of 10 here or there
or gain the factor of 10
so always do a reality check to see if your answer makes sense
so now im gonna confuse you even further
what if i were to ask you 4 is 20 percent of what number
what number
so lot of peoples reflex would might just be
oh let me take 20 percent
it becomes point 2 0
and mutiply it times 4
and in that case again you you may be wrong
cos think about it
im not saying what is 20 percent of 4
im saying that 20 percent of some number is 4
so now were gonna be doing a little bit of algebra
i bet you didnt expect that in the percent module
so let x equal the number
the number
or this number
let x equal that number
and this problem says that 20 percent 20 percent of x is equal to 4
i think now its in a form that you might recognise
so how do you write 20 percent of it as a decimal
well thats just point 2 0 or point 2
and we just multiply it by x to get four
so 20 percent thats the same thing as point 2
its the same thing as point 2 0 but that last trailing 
zero doesnt mean much
point 2 times x is equal to 4
and now we have a level 1 linear equation
i bet you didnt expect to see that
so what do we do
we we can either
oh well there is two ways to view it
you can just divide the both sides of this equation
by the coefficient on x
so if you do divide point 2 here you divide by point 2 here
so you get x is equal to 4 divided by point 2
so lets figure out what 4 divided by point 2 is
see i hope i have enough space
point 2 goes into 4 im gonna put a decimal point here
and the way we do these problems we move the
decimal point here 1 over to the right
we just get a 2 and we can move the decimal point
1 over to the right
so this point 2 goes into 4 the same number of times
that 2 goes into 40
and this is easy
2 goes into 40 how many times
well 2 goes into 4 2 times and then 2 goes 
to 0 0 times
you couldve done that in your head
2 into 40 is 20 times
so 4 divided by point 2 is 20
so the answer is 4 is 20 percent of 20
and does that make sense
well theres a couple ways to think about it
20 percent is roughly what
it it is exactly a one 5th
and right 4 times 5 is 20 
that makes sense
if youre still not sure we can check the problem
lets take 20 percent of 20
so 20 percent of 20 is equal to point 2 times 20
and if you do the maths that also will equal 4
so you made sure you got the right answer
lets do another one like that
eehmm im picking numbers randomly
lets say 3 is mmm hm 9 percent of what
so if x 
once again
lets let x equal the number
the number that 3 is 9 percent of
you dont have to write all that
well in that case we know that point 0 9 x
right point 0 9 thats the same 
thing as 9 percent of x is equal to 3
or that x is equal to 3 divided by point 0 9
well if we do the decimal division point 0 9 goes into 3
lets put a decimal point here
i dont know how many 0s im going to need
so if i move this decimal over to the right twice then ill
move this decimal over to the right twice
so point 0 9 goes into 3 the same number of times
that 9 goes into 300
so 9 goes into 30 three times
3 times 9 is 27
i think i see a pattern here already
30 3 3 times 9 is 27 
youre just gonna keep getting 33 3 3 3 the 3s are just
gonna go on forever
so turns out that 3 is 9 percent of you can either write it as 
33 point 3 repeating or we all know that point 3 forever is the
same thing as one third
so 3 is 9 percent of 33 and one third
either one of those would be an acceptable answer
a lot times when youre doing percentages youre
actually just trying to get a ballpark
so ahm the precision might not always be the most important thing
but in this case we will be precise
and obviously on tests and things you need to
be precise as well
hopefully i didnt go too fast and you have a good 
sense of percentage
the important thing for these type of problems is pay
attention to how the problem is written 
if it says find you know 10 percent of a hundred
thats easy
you just te convert 10 percent to the decimal multiply by 100
but if i were to ask you a 100 is 10 percent of what
you have to remember that thats a different problem
in which case a 100 is 10 percent of and if you did the math
it would be a 1000
i think i spoke very quickly on this problem on this ehhm on this module
so i hope you didnt get too confused
but i will record more
