Nice weather outside...
Yes, it is quite hot today.
Well, yeah, I think it's a very good day to have dinner, don't you agree?
Yes, but I wouldn't know with whom, do you know anybody?
I know an amazing Venetian entrepreneur.
Who is he?
He's right in front of you.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'll come to pick you up at eight pm.
I haven't said yes.
Not yet, where shall I come to pick you up with my Lamborghini?
What do you mean?
Exactly what I said, my Lambo was delivered yesterday from Italy by my enterprise.
So you deal with transports?
Yes, I own a company based in Venice, its name is Idoge, we do delivery and shipping all over the world.
What's the name of the company again?
Idoge, and we also sell machinery that can make pasta, like Italian pasta.
Oh, that's interesting.
And not only that, we started in two thousand sixteen, not too long ago, but actually our customers trust us, we're very well known for our professionalism in fact they give us excellent feedbacks and reviews.
And that's why tonight I'll take you to Mario's restaurant, so you'll be able to taste pasta produced by our machinery.
Boy, you look too confident.
That's because I'm proud of what I do.
So, will you wait for me at your place?
Oh, I'm so pleased but I'm already engaged.
Oh I'm used to it...
Bye, take care.
I'm sorry...
