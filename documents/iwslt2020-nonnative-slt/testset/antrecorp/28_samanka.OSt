Hello!
I'm from the personal department of the company Å amanka, s. r. o., which was founded in two thousand eighteen in the city of Liberec.
We produce non-alcoholic fruit lemonades.
We support both local and foreign distributors of fruit.
We are currently selling six flavours all over the world and one of the flavours is a limited edition.
It's the cotton candy flavour.
If you want to try them, there are some... there are some samples of those in our stand.
Our stand is number seven and I don't think it's open now, but maybe tomorrow.
We should be there.
And I would like to thank you for listening to me about my company and I would like to wish you a lot of luck and fun at this trade.
