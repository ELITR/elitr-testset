Oh, it's been a hard day!
You're right, very hard!
Do you think being here at this trade fair will pay?
Yes, sure!
You know, I am quite confident: selling fashionable and trendy products such as bedroom linens and furniture...
People will be pushed to buy from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are made in Italy: everybody knows it, that stands for high quality.
Yes, you're absolutely right, but remember: we are here to get in touch... in touch with new customers.
Will we be able to target these new markets?
Well, but you know, we are based in Veneto and that is an advantage: we are so close to these markets, Eastern Europe is just behind the corner!
Yeah, but Hungary, Czech Republic and Russia gonna cost a lot of money!
They will foresee a five percent loss in the first year.
C'mon, think positive! This 5 percent is our increase in the third year!
And I'm sure that today we got new customers.
Yeah, you're right.
As a matter of fact, we got all people need to sleep well.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, comfortable mattresses and warm sheets to sleep in?
And everything is handmade by our skilled craftsmen and artisans!
It's such a dream!
Yes, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!
