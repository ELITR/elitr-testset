I feel tired.
This trade fair is so exhausting.
I need somewhere to sit.
Did I hear well?
Are you looking for a comfortable chair, where you can sit and rest yourself?
You are in the right place at the right time and probably I am the right man.
Another annoying seller, who wants to promote his product.
Wait, wait... before jumping to conclusion let me introduce myself.
My name <NAME> and I am a rep of the New Design World.
Our company was founded 1981 in the North-East of Italy by a young group of people joined by the passion for furniture.
We wish to make our high quality and sophisticated products accessible to wide range of users.
Our comfortable chairs, for example, are the right trade-off to combine beauty and elegance.
Oh, interesting.
It sounds like a nice proposal.
I just really wanted to upgrade my office, so go ahead.
We want to offer something that focuses on the customer, without ever renouncing quality, and so, we want to offer our sophisticated products, with a range of users.
And, so...
Are you interested in?
Yes, you took me!
Awesome!
And now that you have planned a basis of your office, why don't you have a look at our bookshelves and tables?
They are comfortable, selected, respecting the environment and completely made in Italy, like all our products.
