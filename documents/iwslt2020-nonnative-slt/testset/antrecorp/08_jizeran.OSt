So, hello, I want to introduce you our company called Jizeran.
We are from Liberec and we brew beer.
So, we started as a small, small group of friends that just wanted to brew beer and after some time we find out that everybody likes it.
we give it to our friends and they likes it, so we start to export internationally and brew in big.
Now we offer four types of beer.
Reichenbier number ten, Reichenbier eleven, Reichenbier thirteen and our special, dark special, fifteen.
We offer our beer in can, bottle, barrel and pet bottle.
And, we, ... our beer is from hops that's imported from Å½atec.
Now, I'm glad that you all listened to me and if you would like to taste our beer you can visit us at stand number forty five.
Thank you.
