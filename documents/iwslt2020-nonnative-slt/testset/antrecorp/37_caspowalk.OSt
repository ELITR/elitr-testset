Hello!
Which floor are you going to?
Hi, fifteenth.
And you?
Twenty second.
Would you mind if I take off my shoes?
Those high heels are killing me!
Of course.
I don't mind it.
Thank you.
Why do you wear those high heels, if you would wear some sneakers?
I know one really good store, that deals with the sale of free-time footwear.
Oh, really?
Yes, actually, I work for them.
It's name is CaspoWalk LTD. and we offer many different shoes from different brands such as Nike, Adidas for each age and gender.
Do you offer some unique shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some of them.
We offer Dutch type clogs as our special offer this month and if you love sport, you would appreciate the brand new Nike shoes called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes, that you can control with your mobile phone.
You can customize a shoe lacing, as you see there, and a color of LED diodes with a mobile app.
If I bought some shoes from you, do you offer me some accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer shoelaces and insoles and many more.
Here is my business card.
Do not hesitate to stop at our branch.
Oh, thank you.
You can also find us here in this building.
We are taking part in a trade fair of student companies.
Thank you very much!
We have reached my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
See you.
Nice to meet you too.
See you.
