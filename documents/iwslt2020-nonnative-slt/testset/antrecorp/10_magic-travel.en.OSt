Hi!
Hi!
Do you work in a travel agency?
Because I saw your tag.
Yes I work for a travel agency back in Venice called Magic Travel.
I was planning on organizing our tour with my new girlfriend.
We do offer romantic tours but if you are more of an adventurous couple we also offer sport and culinary tourism.
We are more of a romantic couple.
We offer tours in Russia, Spain and England.
If you want to have a look at our catalogue...
Yes.
Wow it's very interesting.
Which one would you recommend?
I would recommend Verona because it is the city of love and I think your girlfriend would really much enjoy it.
For any further information I leave you our visiting card where you can come to us at any time.
But I have to make a confession, I don't have a girlfriend and I would like to take you to my romantic tour.
I think we will see each other back at the agency.
