Hello fellas, my name is <NAME> and I am your host for today's infomercial which is presented by the most famous practice firm, straight outta Austria, Total Regal.
We have conquered the market all the way since nineteen ninety nine and we have crushed other firm's dreams also.
So, in fact our chief executive officer has led this successful organization before some of you all weren't even born yet.
Think about that.
So we are our... where are our headquarters located?
They are obviously in the mountains.
No just kidding, we actually do have real cities besides Vienna.
And, our dress code?
Short skirts and leather shorts, no just kidding.
But we actually might crack up our traditional clothes at some of the countless parties that we have, to have one beer or something.
Alright make that two beers.
So, why should you buy our products?
We have been selling our most popular products, which have become really iconic by the way, since nineteen ninety nine, so two decades.
And... Like the Helping Hand, which is a perfect storage for any kind of clothes, just like jackets, or the Spacewonder where you can stack up shoes and bags.
So go check out our store and like we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
