God afternoon.
My name is <NAME> and today I represent the Time Travel Agency Practice firm.
The company has been in two thousand fourteen. In two thousand eighteen, our class took it over, and rebranding happened, as a result, today, the company is focusing more on historical packages.
The team has three leading members and twenty two eleventh grade students.
As I said, we combine the magic of the past with modern trends, all this to meet the costumers demanding.
Every package that we offer to the clients has three basic type of services: transportation, accommodation and meal, and a variety of complementary services.
For example, folk art workshop, wine tasting, camps for children, equestrian and archery courses, paintball nights, meetings and conferences.
As a tribute to the past, Time Travel Agency donates five percent on the revenue to the castles we cooperate with.
You can reach us by many ways, Facebook, e-mail, Instagram and post office.
We have a webpage on timetravelsrl.wixsite.com.
Feel free to visit to the stand number sixty six.
Take your time with time travel agency.
Thank you for your attention.
