Excuse me!
Good morning.
Can I have a look, please?
Good morning, yes, sure, here it is.
Thank you.
I'm a.
I'm.
I work for the travel agency "Il Gabbiano", are you interested in any particular stay proposal?
Yes, I would like to visit some European city, but I don't know which one.
So, we operate all over Europe and I'd suggest you a cold place like Vienna, since that I like it, otherwise I'd rather suggest you Barcelona.
Could you tell me how does your agency work?
We work in different groups according to their own tasks, they're called marketing, marketing, a front office and they all collaborate to develop the stay proposals.
That's fantastic, that's really interesting.
And do you have a business card so I can call you later for others information?
Yes, I think...
Yes, here it is.
That's fantastic.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Goodbye!
Bye!
