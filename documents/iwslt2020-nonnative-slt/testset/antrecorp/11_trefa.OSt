Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I am a representative of company called Trefa s.r.o.
We are specialized in selling sweets and sweet drinks.
Our one of the best selling products is a liquorice from Morocco from our business partner called Mishoc.
They have a really rich history.
Those liquorice are one of the best of the kind.
They are long-lasting.
They also see... they also sell us biscuits.
Those biscuits are made of one hundred percent chocolate.
Also, we import from Russia.
Russia is one of our... our biggest business partners.
They sell us chocolate, they sell us biscuits, they sell us bonbons.
The Russian chocolate, even-though some call it not good as compared to Swiss chocolate or the chocolate form the Belgium, is also one of the best in the world.
Also, if you would like to taste something, anything, we have a stand number eight.
You can go there, you can taste absolutely anything you want.
If you want to buy something, we have a twenty percent discount on everything at the moment.
Well, that's everything.
I'm glad you listened to me.
Have a good day.
