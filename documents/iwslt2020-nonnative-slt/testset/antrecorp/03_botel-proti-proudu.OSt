Hello.
Hey.
Oh, this is very nice T-shirt.
What is this brand?
Oh, it's not a brand, it's a logo of my botel.
Oh really?
You have a botel?
Oh, yes I do.
We are situated in hearth of České Budějovice on the Vltava river and we have three classes of room.
The first class room is named Goldfish and it's the most luxurious room in our botel.
Then we have second class, Silverfish, and then we have a third class called the Bronzefish.
Wow, do you have some special rooms?
Oh yes, we do.
We have a special room made for lovers to spend their anniversaries and something like that.
Wow, and you have some restaurant, and...
Oh yes, we do.
We have a restaurant for our clients, but for public also, but our clients eat there for free.
And if you spend more time than you wanted in our restaurant, you know, it can happen, you can enjoy our fitness centrum with the newest equipment.
Wow sorry I don't like fitness and you have some massage, and...?
Well, if you're not really keen on fitness, you can visit our relax centrum, with massageses, saunas, hot rocks, and so on.
Wow, OK, I love it, this is great.
And, if I can say it, we have free wi-fi in our whole botel and free parking for our guests.
Oh wow, thank you.
I hope you will come.
I will.
