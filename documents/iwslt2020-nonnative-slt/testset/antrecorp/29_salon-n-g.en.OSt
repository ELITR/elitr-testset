Hello, do I know you from somewhere?
Hello, it seems to me that we have already met before, we might have visited the same college few years ago.
I'm, to you?
I'm, what do you do for a living?
Well I'm EO of a small business called Salon NG, which is salon for animals.
Oh, that's nice. That sounds really interesting, could you tell me some, something more about that please?
Yes, of course.
We specialize in care of dogs, cats, horses and rodents.
We can offer you some services like cutting the claws, cleaning their ears or just scissoring the fur.
But we can offer some stuff too, like dog beds and bedding, so... pets clothes or just dog food, especially from Czech and antiallergents brand Ontario.
Have you got any pets?
We can offer you the highest quality care of him if you would like.
Yeah, I have a dog, I would like to cut his claws, for me they are too long.
Could you give me your business card please?
Oh I'm sorry, I forgot them upstairs, but I'm going for them right now, so if you want, you can go with me.
Okay let's go.
