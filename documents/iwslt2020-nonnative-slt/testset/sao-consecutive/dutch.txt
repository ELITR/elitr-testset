censored you are online can you hear us
do you want me to start
yes
ok ha ha ha sorry
first of all thank you for inviting me to speak at your edata conference
with an access to government information it is a fundamental democratic right
and that role requires the government to share public information
a society changed a great deal since an act came into force
and information is no longer kept on paper but in dynamic computer systems
and at the meantime virtually everyone is connected through a series of devices to the internet
and twenty first century government can respond to these challenges by giving the public direct access to government information
in another words the government could publish open data actively
then the volume of open data cannot be seen separately from the move towards digital government
and here the united kingdom and the united states are setting the pace
they see open data em are clearly not a goal but a means to become transparent
and they are leading in the w the world in the open government partnership
an ini initiative to encourage government to be as open as possible
and in europe there are several european directives and treaties which are important for open data legislation and policies
and the dutch government has open data ambitions and policies
but the actual implementation is still grass roots and its in early stages
the netherlands court of audit and its former president mrs stuiveling see the great potential in open data
and in 2013 we decided to monitor the progress of open data in the netherlands
in our first report we concentrated on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the netherlands
we did a survey on the commitment of the ministries to open data
our approach is positive because we concentrated on ministries which were doing well and we tried to encourage the ministries who fell behind
and through sessions with open data experts and civil servants and publications of factsheets with good examples national and international
in second report we emphasised the importance of open data and monitored progress
weve in identified several potential benefits of open data
open data offers opportunities to the government
and by opening em e data on its expenditure and performance the government will have better understanding of its own funding
this way it turn how the parliament scrutinise the government
for citizens the open data sets would make the government more transparent and accessible
from a business view innovative entrepreneurs can turn open data into new applications
one of our objectives was what the netherlands could learn from the united kingdom and the united states
using data for the open data bio meter made by world web foundation we compared three aspects of open data
the awareness to secure positive outcomes from open government data initiatives
the extent to which open data are available
and the impact on society business and government
ehm society business and government
and if we compared i am sorry
sorry
i am getting am getting em my voice feeding back into the monitor
it is very distractive
ok
but continue
if we compare the united kingdom and united states with the netherlands
we can see that the united kingdom and united states come better on implementation and impact
there is little difference regarding the readiness for open data
if we look at readiness the netherlands score less well
only with regards to the right for information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives
regarding availability united kingdom and united states publish far more open data than the netherlands
the number of open data sets in the united states is enormous
the type of data the countries release differs on the number of points
the netherlands currently publish publishes little open data on government spending and public contracting
and the dutch trade register is not open either
as you can see the u united kingdom has open data on all policy fields
the impact of open data can be broken down into political social and economic dimensions
and the netherlands lag behind united kingdom and united states on the shows social and economic dimensions
this means that the netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in making and scrutinising government policy
businesses generate little added value with open data
in both our reports weve added international examples which can serve as a good example for the netherlands
and in sweden for example municipalities and regions publish detailed charts on waiting times for hospitals
we did not re rely on open data barometers only
and we did our own research as well
and to get a better picture of the volume and type of open data currently available
we looked at the data that are published on our national open data portal
in total there is a three thousand two hundreds data sets were available in february february two thousand and fifteen
and slightly more than half of the data sets are provided by central government
the greater part of the open data published by central government is produced by the ministry of infrastructure
and the ministrys public work public work dimension is by far the most important source of open data in the netherlands
for our two reports we asked all ministries what actions they are taking to publish open data
and the score we awarded to each ministry was based on six indicators
such as support from the top of the ministry and persons of an action plan
since the publication of our first report some ministries took exceptional initiatives to publish open data
we also asked the ministries how many people and how much funding they have provided in two thousand and fou fourteen
their answers were very different
ministry of defence and ministry of security and justice had spent no time or money on publication of public data
but other ministries have tasked several people with publishing open data and have released a budget for activities
and the conclusions of two thousand and thirteen ff fourteen we concluded that the open data are a standard but not yet practice
and the open data that have been enacted there has been a concerned chiefly with the government what government knows rather than what a government does
we also got a couple of comments and em a they rely on the ehm the success of open data policy
and the government should ehm give a greater inside into what data are available
they should create right conditions right conditions for open data
and the third one was that the government must invest in both the supply and the demand sides of open data
for example by founding an open data institute
for our two thousand and fifteen report we found that the government and ministries had taken steps to make open data more widely accepted
and partly in response to our first open data turned report the ministry of interior is cur currently coordinating a government wide data set analysis
the netherlands is thus following the good examples set by the united kingdom and united states
there was a downside
we also found that the open data provided through the national portal was one sided
virtual virtually all the open data sets are geo data geographical data and almost all of them are published by one ministry
very few data are important that are important for a public control of government finances and government activities are available
most of our conclusions we believe that the following point should be taken into consideration for the development of the dutch open data policy
thus dutch government should define goals and milestones in a concrete action plan
and we also think that the opening of data should be mandatory
and the government should develop a national information infrastructure
on which em will be determined what data are the grow greatest social importance and what data should in any event be open data
and the government should use open data themselves for example in the social domain decentralisations
this is a big nationwide programme in the netherlands where responsibility is being transferred from the cetr central government to to municipalities
our em our reports had a positive impact
the ministry of interior will publish results of a government wide data sets data survey this month
and the house of representatives accepted the motion for a national information infrastructure
and based on the data inventory the ministry of interior will set up a national open data agenda
and in that agenda they will publish what data wi em will be open and when they will open it
ehm we also try to lead by the example ehm
and we published our own expenditure on the on our website so that everyone can see what the netherlands court of audit spends its mone spends its money on
such a form of financial transparency is called open spending
and the ministry of finance now has planned to open up detailed expenditure data for the government next year
ok
as you have seen the open data movement in the netherlandsis maturing and the netherlands court of audit will continue to follow the progress
thank you for your attention
and if you are interested you can find our reports in english and our spending data in dutch on our website
