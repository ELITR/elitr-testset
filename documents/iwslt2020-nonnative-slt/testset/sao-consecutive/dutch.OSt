<CENSORED> you are on-line, can you hear us?
Do you want me to start?
Yes.
Ok, ha ha ha, sorry.
First of all, thank you for inviting me to speak at your e-data conference.
With an access to government information it is a fundamental democratic right.
And that role requires the government to share public information.
A society changed a great deal since an act came into force.
And information is no longer kept on paper but in dynamic computer systems.
And at the meantime virtually everyone is connected through a series of devices to the internet.
And twenty first century government can respond to these challenges by giving the public direct access to government information.
In another words, the government could publish open data actively.
Then the volume of open data cannot be seen separately from the move towards digital government.
And here the United Kingdom and the United States are setting the pace.
They see open data, em are clearly not a goal but a means to become transparent.
And they are leading in the w the world in the open government partnership...
An ini initiative to encourage government to be as open as possible.
And in Europe there are several european directives and treaties which are important for open data legislation and policies.
And the Dutch government has open data ambitions and policies.
But the actual implementation is still grass roots and its in early stages.
The Netherlands Court of Audit and its former President, Mrs. Stuiveling, see the great potential in open data.
And in 2013, we decided to monitor the progress of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report we concentrated on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We did a survey on the commitment of the ministries to open data.
Our approach is positive, because we concentrated on ministries which were doing well and we tried to encourage the ministries who fell behind.
And through sessions with open data experts and civil servants, and publications of factsheets with good examples national and international.
In second report we emphasised the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We've in identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers opportunities to the government.
And by opening em e data on its expenditure and performance, the government will have better understanding of its own funding.
This way it turn how the parliament scrutinise the government.
For citizens the open data sets would make the government more transparent and accessible.
From a business view, innovative entrepreneurs can turn open data into new applications.
One of our objectives was what the Netherlands could learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Using data for the open data bio meter made by World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of open data.
The awareness to secure positive outcomes from open government data initiatives.
The extent to which open data are available.
And the impact on society, business and government.
ehm society, business and government
And if we compared I am sorry.
Sorry.
I am getting am getting em my voice feeding back into the monitor.
It is very distractive.
OK.
But continue.
If we compare the United Kingdom and United States with the Netherlands...
We can see that the United Kingdom and United States come better on implementation and impact.
There is little difference regarding the readiness for open data.
If we look at readiness, the Netherlands score less well.
Only with regards to the right for information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
Regarding availability, United Kingdom and United States publish far more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data sets in the United States is enormous.
The type of data the countries release differs on the number of points.
The Netherlands currently publish publishes little open data on government spending and public contracting.
And the Dutch Trade Register is not open either.
As you can see the u United Kingdom has open data on all policy fields.
The impact of open data can be broken down into political, social and economic dimensions.
And the Netherlands lag behind United Kingdom and United States on the shows social and economic dimensions.
This means that the Netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in making and scrutinising government policy.
Businesses generate little added value with open data.
In both our reports we've added international examples which can serve as a good example for the Netherlands.
And in Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed charts on waiting times for hospitals.
We did not re rely on open data barometers only.
And we did our own research as well.
And to get a better picture of the volume and type of open data currently available
we looked at the data that are published on our national open data portal.
In total there is a three thousand two hundreds data sets were available in February February two thousand and fifteen.
And slightly more than half of the data sets are provided by central government.
The greater part of the open data published by central government is produced by the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And the ministry's public work public work dimension is by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands.
For our two reports we asked all ministries what actions they are taking to publish open data.
And the score we awarded to each ministry, was based on six indicators.
Such as support from the top of the ministry and person's of an action plan.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries took exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and how much funding they have provided in two thousand and fou fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Security and Justice had spent no time or money on publication of public data.
But other ministries have tasked several people with publishing open data and have released a budget for activities.
And the conclusions of two thousand and thirteen ff fourteen; we concluded that the open data are a standard but not yet practice.
And the open data that have been enacted there has been a concerned chiefly with the government what government knows rather than what a government does.
We also got a couple of comments and em a they rely on the ehm the success of open data policy.
And the government should ehm give a greater inside into what data are available.
They should create right conditions, right conditions for open data.
And the third one was that the government must invest in both; the supply and the demand sides of open data.
For example by founding an open data institute.
For our two thousand and fifteen report we found that the government and ministries had taken steps to make open data more widely accepted.
And partly in response to our first open data turned report, the Ministry of Interior is cur currently coordinating a government wide data set analysis.
The Netherlands is thus following the good examples set by the United Kingdom and United States.
There was a downside.
We also found that the open data provided through the national portal was one sided.
Virtual virtually all the open data sets are geo data, geographical data, and almost all of them are published by one ministry.
Very few data are important, that are important for a public control of government finances and government activities are available.
Most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into consideration for the development of the Dutch open data policy.
Thus Dutch government should define goals and milestones in a concrete action plan.
And we also think that the opening of data should be mandatory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
On which em will be determined what data are the grow greatest social importance and what data should in any event be open data.
And the government should use open data themselves for example in the social domain decentralisations.
This is a big nationwide programme in the Netherlands, where responsibility is being transferred from the cetr central government to to municipalities.
Our em our reports had a positive impact.
The Ministry of Interior will publish results of a government wide data sets data survey this month.
And the House of Representatives accepted the Motion for a national information infrastructure.
And based on the data inventory, the Ministry of Interior will set up a national open data agenda.
And in that agenda they will publish what data wi em will be open and when they will open it.
Ehm we also try to lead by the example ehm
And we published our own expenditure on the on our website so that everyone can see what the Netherlands Court of Audit spends its mone spends its money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open spending.
And the Ministry of Finance now has planned to open up detailed expenditure data for the government next year.
OK.
As you have seen the open data movement in the Netherlandsis maturing and the Netherlands Court of Audit will continue to follow the progress.
Thank you for your attention.
And if you are interested you can find our reports in English and our spending data in Dutch on our website.
