mister mayrbeurle the floor is yours
thank you
thank you very much for the invitation
it is an honour for me to be here to speak to you
and my topic is to give you a brief overview about our big data tool we use in the austrian court of audit since three years now
so before i really start i want to give you an overview of the biggest austrian municipalities
you can see the municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants and since two thousand and eleven we are entitled to audit all these local governments
the limit before was twenty thousand
so the grey points are over twenty thousand inhabitants and the blue ones are under twenty thousand
the explanations is still in german
sorry for that
so in total we are entitled to audit seventy five municipalities
this is about three point two percent of the total amount
but we are counseling all austrian communities
and for that reason we decided in our department to develop a special tool which we call the municipality monitoring tool
and the development team consists of three young economists in our department and i am one of those
and we all three use the tool for different purposes
so what was the goal what was the aim for the em reason for designing this tool
the main reason was to to find an analysis tool for the financial risk assessment
so we are trying firstly to prepare a profile for each municipality
with to consideration of all relevant factors
in the second step we assess the municipalities with regard to their significance for the audit activisties of the austrian current austrian court of audit
and finally we rank the municipalities according to the financial risk on the basis of certain indicators
the ranking is always the interesting part the most interesting part of the whole story because we can compare any municipalities
thank you
so the biggest challenge of every database project is to collect data with quality
we heard it the day before
in this context we are happy to to use the data of the statistics of austria which is the austrian statistics agency and this agency is our most important partner in this project
and we get the following data ehm
actually this data is open for every citizen
but you have to buy it from the statistics of austria if you want the aggregated data
and only the aggregated data is useful for analysis
so we have the gross cutting accounts of the budgeting and accounts regulations
we have detailed info infomo information of the closed accounts so we have the accounts on its free ticket level
and we have statements of debts and liabilities
so mainly we use finance and accounting data but of course we have sss separately we have data numbers of population and other data which come from the statistics of austria s
what we we have the data from the period now from two thousand eight to two thousand and thirteen
ah that is a mistake i am sorry about it
and we constantly updating this data every autumn
as we have the data from the accounting systems of the municipalities we we have no data about the municipality contributions we have no data about the lease obligations and we have no data of the balances and assets because the municipalities do not publish this data
this is an important point because em in in practice when you go to the municipality and you have the official accountant you find the debt number and if you go to the em to the corporation to the municipality contributions it may happen tha it may happen that you find this debt number once again so it will be double and you only have half of the story if you only check the em the accounts of the accounts of the municipality itself
so from the existing data we think that our sell well indicators which i will explain later and we try to make a indicator model and this monitoring is based on a model which is comprised of indicators that are compiled as assessment indicators broken down with themes
and from these a statistic is derived between one and hundred that is closest to relevance for audit
so this model enables a rating of the indicators according to specific issues
and in order to set the relevance for audit the austrian court of audit uses the indicators for the financial situation as the basic setting but depending on the issue raised depending on the issue on to audit you can choose another indicator setting
and you have a different result
so the indicator model consists of four topics and the first one is the financial situation in the longterm
that means we we take the net debts plus the liabilities minus security holdings and minus reserves
so the first one gives us the longterm perspective that means debt minus assets
and the second one gives us the shortterm perspective
which isyes please
for a shortterm we define the core balance which is the current revenues without transfers minus current expenditures without transfers and pensions
that is an important point of the indicator model because we we are not using em key figures which i expressed em per capita
we are using a different key figure and this is the own earnings as a relevant figure because its better to to to show the economic power of the municipalitity
so the next one is the admisni administrative structure
where we simply put together the administrative expenses and personnel expenses
last one was the biggest challenge for us
we tried to to assess the quality of accounting systems
and yes we take into account other accounts the miscellaneous accounts the representation expenses and the analysis of special accounts
that means we are trying to find book keeping errors with this data
so this slide is a screen shot of one possible output of the monitoring tool
and you can see the municipalities which are listed em end from from the best municipality down to the worst
so the black column gives us the value and it is with regard to the significance of the audit activities for the austrian court of audit and for that in this picture it is ranked for for a relevance of audit for our department
so the four columns on the right gives us the indicators
the indicators of the model i explained before
and the black column gives us the value three point thirty three which is take municipality hallwang which is a small municel municipality near to salzburg and this one is the best municipality
that means it is a benchmark
so if you want to audit the municipality with the best financial sit in the best financial situation we audit hallwang
if you want to audit the worst one we just skip the picture and take the last one but i dont want to show you this municipalities today
and we have all municipalities of austria in our system but not every municipality is in our em is in our duty in our assessment duty so only the second one yes the second one is is is possible to audit for us
and we try to compare the municipalities with the class of municipalities with the same size so we are not comparing vienna to hallwang so we are trying to find similar municipalities so em so it will be a fair compare comparision
so we have many different output possibilities of this tool and another feature is this output journal for every single municipality
here for example we have the municipality hallwang
we can do thi th th this journal for every municipality of austria and you as you can see you i think you will not be able to read it but it gives us a lot if indik key figures indicators graphs and em of the financial situation and development
another output of the journal is em these two pages for example you can see the analysis of the personal expenses em on the left side this is the red line of the graph
and in comparison to the the other municipalities you can choose the blue line and where the red line exceeds the blue line the municipality is worse
or
so you can easily assess if the municipality has excessive expenditures
so and on the right side we have the transfers that means we have the outgoing and the incoming money in a perspective of the municipality
but these two outputs are only two of many
we are now using a some statistical programs like r stat plus and we are able to do any analysis em which is em em necessary em which is asked by our em our bosses
so as you can see we we use this tool for the audit planning for the preparation for the operational level and upon request that means when somebody is going to municipality just for a presentation you can use the journal
if you want to know which municipalities are worse in a region we can do it and this information helps us not only in the in the audit itself
and in line with our advisory approach we provide the specific fact shets fact sheets to the municipality
that means if the if the mayor calls us and wants to know about his municipality and how their financial situation is in the in this municipality we can give them a fact sheets and the journal
so thank you very much for your attention
thank you
