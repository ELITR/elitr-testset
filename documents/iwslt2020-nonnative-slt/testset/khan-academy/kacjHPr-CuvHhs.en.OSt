 welcome lets talk about the web
the thing that youre using right now
the web is this fast network of connected computers
and as of 2014 there are literally more than
a billion websites a billion
when i was a kid we only had one million
and we thought we were cool
what do we use websites for
well in the beginning researchers used websites to share
their research like on highenergy particle colliders
but now everybody uses it for pretty much everything
maybe you use a social network to chat with your family
a photo website for sharing photos
of your adorable kitty cats
a travel website to decide where to go on an exotic trip
or a news website to figure out
whats going on in the world
and of course you must be using
the khan academy website to learn
so whats your favorite website
actually i have a better question
what website do you wish existed but doesnt yet
maybe a website about yourself
or about something that you love
the cool thing is you can program a website yourself
and you can learn how to do it here on khan academy
start brainstorming what you want to make
because youll be able to do it soon enough
first lets back up a bit and clear up some terminology
what is the web exactly
well like i said its a bunch of
connected computers that have websites
when a computer is connected to the web
and spitting out a website we call that computer a server
because its serving the website
a website is written using three languages
html for marking up the website content
css for styling it
and javascript for making it interactive
how do users like you actually see those websites
well you use an app dedicated for website browsing
like chrome firefox or internet explorer
and we call those apps browsers
browsers try to all show the same website the same way
but they do have their differences which is why
we sometimes say oops theres a bug in that browser
try another one
which browser are you using right now
well you must be using that browser
from some sort of device like a laptop
phone tablet or even a smart tv
and we call those devices clients
clients can be really different
some are way smaller than others
some have touchscreens others have keyboards
some are black and white
so websites have to try to work well
in all sorts of clients
what client are you using right now
and thats the web
well the twominute version
theres lots more to learn about the web
but now i think its about time to start having you write
some html and css to make your own web pages
