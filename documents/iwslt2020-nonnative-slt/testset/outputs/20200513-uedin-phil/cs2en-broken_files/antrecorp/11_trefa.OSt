Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I represent Trefa s.r.o.
We focus on selling candy and sweet drinks.
One of our best sold products is liquor from Morocco from our business partner Mishoc.
Mishoc has a really rich history.
This liquor is one of the best species.
It's very durable.
We also buy cookies from them.
These cookies are made of 100% chocolate.
We also import goods from Russia.
Russia is one of our largest partners.
We buy chocolate, biscuits and candy from them.
Although some say that Russian chocolate is not as good as Swiss or Belgian chocolate, it is also among the best in the world.
If you'd like to taste anything, you'll find us at stand number eight.
You can come and taste whatever you want.
If you want to buy anything, then we have a 20% discount on all the goods today.
That's all, then.
I'm glad you listened to me.
Have a good day.
