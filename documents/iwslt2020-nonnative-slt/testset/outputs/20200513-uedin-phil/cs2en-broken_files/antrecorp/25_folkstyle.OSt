Hello. Hello.
My name is <NAME> and I am from the fictitious company Folkstyle from <CITY>.
I'd like to say a few words about our company.
Our company Folkstyle comes from Slovakia and focuses on the production of clothes and fashion accessories decorated with traditional Slovak folklore motifs.
Folklore, as you know, has a very long tradition in Slovakia and therefore we still have rich sources of ideas.
It should be emphasised that all our products are hand embroidered.
In our wide range you will find embroidered dresses, skirts, bracelets and bracelets or very popular butterflies today - I have one, by the way, right now.
With our products we draw from folk motifs from various regions of Slovakia.
We are trying to combine these motifs with the latest fashion trends to create timeless pieces of clothes that should not be missing in any wardrobe.
We offer products for all ages that will satisfy younger and older customers.
When you order our products, you will not wait for the goods for more than 30 days.
Payment is possible both by cash and by bank transfer.
