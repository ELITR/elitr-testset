Hello, have we met from somewhere?
Hi, I feel like we've met before, maybe we went to the same school a few years ago.
Yes, and you?
Yes, what do you do for a living now?
I'm the director of the small business Salon NG, which is the animal salon.
Oh, that sounds very interesting, could you tell me more about him?
Yes, of course.
We are focusing on the care of dogs, cats, horses and rodents.
We offer services such as claw cutting, ears cleaning or just hair cutting.
However, we also offer various products such as dog beds and beds, animal clothes and dog food, especially without allergens, from the Czech company Ontario.
Do you have any pets?
We can provide you with the highest quality care if you're interested.
Yes, I have a dog. I'd like to cut his claws. They seem too long.
Would you please give me a card?
Oh, sorry, I forgot them upstairs, but I'll get them right away.
All right, let's go.
