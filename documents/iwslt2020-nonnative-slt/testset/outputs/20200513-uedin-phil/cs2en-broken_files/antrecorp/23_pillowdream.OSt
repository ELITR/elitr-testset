Oh, that would be a tough day!
You're right, really challenging!
Do you think it's worth taking part in this fair?
Oh, sure!
You know, I don't lack confidence because we sell fashionable and trendy products like bed linen and furniture...
People can't resist buying anything from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are manufactured in Italy: everyone knows that this is a guarantee of high quality.
You're absolutely right, but remember: we're here to make contact with new customers.
Can we apply to these new markets?
Well, you know, our headquarters are in Venet and that's the advantage: we're so close to these markets, Eastern Europe is right around the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will be expensive!
It'll mean a 5% loss in the first year.
Come on, think positively! Those five percent will be our profits in the third year!
And I'm sure we got new customers today.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, everyone needs a good night's sleep.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, a comfortable mattress and a warm sleeping blanket?
And it's all handmade by our skillful craftsmen!
It's a dream!
Well, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!
