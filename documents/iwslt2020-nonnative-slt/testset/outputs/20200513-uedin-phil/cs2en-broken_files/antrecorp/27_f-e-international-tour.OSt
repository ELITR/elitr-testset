Hello, my name is <NAME>, like the car, and I am a marketing representative of the International Tour, a tourist agency that sells tourist products in Romania and the rest of Europe.
We manage to satisfy customers, and our team is, in my opinion, the best.
I can say we're participating in a lot of competitions.
And we're achieving the excellent results that we're benefiting from today.
Last year, we took part in an internship at this time, and as I want to make an offer, I will be based on my own experience.
We spent seven-day holidays in Rimini, Italy, in the three-star Hotel Kursaal, located near the sea cliff and has a private beach and rooms with partial sea view. The price is 720 euros for six nights for two people.
I also have a flyer with me that contains three different offers.
One is staying in Rome, the other is city break and the last is staying in our city, Bucharest, in our four star Interbusiness hotel.
Finally, I must add that at this fair, customers can benefit from a 10% discount.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you so much.
