Hello! Hello!
I am from the staff department of Å amanka, s.r.o., which was founded in 2018 in the city of Liberec.
We make non-alcoholic fruit lemonades.
We support local and foreign fruit suppliers.
We are currently selling six flavours throughout the world, one of which is a limited edition.
It's a taste of sugar wadding.
If you'd like to taste them, you'll find the samples in our stand.
We have stand number seven, and I don't think it's open right now, but hopefully tomorrow.
We should be there.
I would like to thank you for listening to the presentation of my company, and I would like to wish you good luck and fun at this fair.
