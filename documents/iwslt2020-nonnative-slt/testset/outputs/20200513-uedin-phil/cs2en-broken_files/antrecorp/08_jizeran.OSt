Hello, I'd like to introduce you to Jizeran Company.
We're from Liberec, making beer.
We started as a small group of friends who simply wanted to cook beer, but soon we discovered that everyone likes it.
We offered to our friends and they liked it, so we started exporting it abroad and cooking in large numbers.
Today we offer four kinds of beer.
Ten Reichenbier, eleven Reichenbier, threeteen Reichenbier and our specialty, dark special of fifteen.
We offer beer in cans, bottles, barrels and five bottles.
Our beer is from hops from Å½atka.
I'm glad you listened to me, and if you'd like to taste our beer, you can visit us at stand forty-five.
Thank you. Thank you.
