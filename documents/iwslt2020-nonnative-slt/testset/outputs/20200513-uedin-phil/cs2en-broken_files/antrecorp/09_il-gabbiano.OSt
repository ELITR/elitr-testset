I work for the travel agency "Il Gabbiano", would you like a specific trip?
Yes, I'd like to visit some European city, but I don't know which one.
Our offer covers all of Europe and I would recommend a cold place like Vienna because I like it. Otherwise I can propose Barcelona.
Could you tell me how your agency works?
We work in several groups broken down by assignment, marketing, customer contact department, and they all work together to develop an offer of tours.
That's great, really interesting.
Do you have a card so I can call you later for further information?
Yes, I think...
Yes, there he is.
That's great.
Thank you so much.
Please.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
