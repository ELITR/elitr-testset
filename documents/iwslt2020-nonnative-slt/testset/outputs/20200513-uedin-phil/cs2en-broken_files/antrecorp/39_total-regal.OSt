Hello, my name is <NAME> and I'll show you today's company presentation in which I will present the most famous fictional company, directly from Austria, Total Regal.
Since 1999, we have ruled the market and destroyed other companies' dreams.
Our Executive Director was actually running this company before some of you were born.
Imagine it.
So where is our headquarters?
On the mountains, of course.
No, I'm joking, we really have other cities than Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirt and short leather trousers, no, I'm kidding.
But actually, it may happen that we pull traditional clothes out for one of the countless parties we're hosting when we want to have one beer or something.
Well, well, you're more like two beers.
So why should you buy our products?
The most popular of our products, which have already become real icons, by the way, we have been selling since 1999, or two decades.
For example Helping Hand, which is a great way to store all kinds of clothes, such as jackets, or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and purse.
So come see our store and, as we say in German, "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
