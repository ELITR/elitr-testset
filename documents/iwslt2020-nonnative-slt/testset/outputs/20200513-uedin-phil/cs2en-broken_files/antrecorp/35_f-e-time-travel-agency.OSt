Good afternoon.
My name is <NAME> and I represent the fictional company Time Travel Agency.
The company was founded in 2014. In 2018, our class took over it, rebranding it, and the result is that today the company is more focused on historical packages.
The team has three leading members and twenty-two elevators of eleventh grade.
As I said, we associate the magic of the past with modern trends in order to meet customers' requirements.
Each package we offer includes three basic services: transport, accommodation and meals and various other additional services.
For example, a folk art workshop, wine tasting, children's camps, equestrian courses and archery courses, night paintball, meetings and conferences.
In order to show respect for the past, Time Travel Agency donates five percent of the profits to the castles with which it cooperates.
You can contact us in many ways, on Facebook, email, Instagram and post.
Our website is on timetravelsrl.wixsite.com.
Don't hesitate to come see our stand number sixty-six.
Enjoy a while with the Time Travel Agency!
Thank you for your attention.
