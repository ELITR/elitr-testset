Hello, my name is <NAME> and I am the executive director of the Smart Team from the University of Economics of Maria Teiulen in Pitești, Romania.
Our company's intention is to provide agrotourism services in Romania's tourist areas and to promote the tourist potential so that we are the leading market in this area.
After market analysis for the winter season 2019, we have created an offer for you that you can't resist.
We called the package "Explore the Land of Dracula".
It offers wonderful experiences in the city of Bran, in Poiana Brašov, where Drákula was born.
We offer you three incredible days during which you can relax, enjoy, visit the surroundings, take photos and get memories of your lifetime.
The first day begins with visiting the famous castle of Bran, or "the castle of vampire Dracula", a place full of mysteries.
The next day, you and your friends or family will enjoy visiting Dino Park, the only dinosaur park in Romania and the largest such park in southeastern Europe.
The next goal will be to discover one of the magnificent creations of nature, the "Canyon of Seven Stairs", which consists of seven waterfalls, the highest of which is thirty-five metres tall.
You will have enough time on the last day to enjoy twelve slopes, as we will provide you with a free daily ticket.
And how better could you end your trip than a special photo lesson in the Carpathians?
We hope that we have aroused your curiosity to find out more about our offer and services, and we can't wait to meet you at our 58 stand.
