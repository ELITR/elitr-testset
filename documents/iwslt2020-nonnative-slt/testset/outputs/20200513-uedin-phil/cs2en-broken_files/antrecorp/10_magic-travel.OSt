Hello! Hello!
Hello! Hello!
You work for a travel agency?
Because I saw your label.
Yes, I work for a travel agency in Vienna named Magic Travel.
I'm planning on a trip with my girlfriend.
We offer romantic trips, but if you are more an adventurous couple, we also offer sports and culinary trips.
We're more romantic than romantic.
We offer trips to Russia, Spain and England.
If you want to see our catalogue...
Yes, I did.
Wow, that's interesting.
Which would you recommend?
I would recommend Verona, because it's a city of love, and I think your girlfriend would really like it.
If you have any further questions, I'll give you our card to contact us at any time.
But I have to confess to you, I don't have a girlfriend, and I'd like to go on a romantic trip with you.
I think we'll meet at the office again.
