Hello, good morning!
Good morning!
I'm sorry...
That's a wonderful hat!
That's our main product, we're Hat&Cap from Italy.
I mean... so you're making hats?
No, we sell them, we're all young people with innovative ideas.
Whoa!
But this is a breathtaking hat!
But I think it has to be very expensive, it's excellent quality.
Yes, we really use the best materials offered by the market, because our goal is the complete satisfaction of the customer.
But how can I buy a hat like that?
Find us on social media.
You will find our catalogue and business terms.
Sounds good!
And also... we're here at the fair, stand number 92.
Come visit us!
Really? Yeah.
I don't think I have to buy that hat.
Goodbye!
Hey, my hat, my hat!
