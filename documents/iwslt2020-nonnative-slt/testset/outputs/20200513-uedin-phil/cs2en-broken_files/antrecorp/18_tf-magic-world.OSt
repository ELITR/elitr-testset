Hello! Hello!
My name is <NAME> and I represent the Magic World Team.
Magic World focuses on organizing social events, especially for children and teenagers, such as birthday, private and thematic celebrations.
Our goal is to become the most famous company that organizes such events.
Our mission is to make a simple event something spectacular.
Over time, the company's activities have diverged as we take more and more into account the needs and requirements of our customers.
Today we have a wide range for different ages, such as clown parties, fairy tale parties, comic characters parties, magician and karaoke performances and puppet theatre.
We keep up with marketing trends, so we organize celebrations at home, in kindergarten and primary schools and in other places according to the customer's wishes.
We offer complete services: face painting, various types of balloons and thematic decorations for unforgettable celebrations.
Our employees have experience with children and we have been working in this field for a long time.
We are convinced that our company has a business idea that is profitable because it is focused on the future, it has experienced employees who work with enthusiasm, and above all its offer is comprehensive and based on customers' needs.
That's why our motto is, "We enjoy entertaining you!"
