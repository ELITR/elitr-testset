Ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I am the director of the fictional company FictionalCine, which performs the movies, shows movies and prepare educational programs for schools.
Our company was founded in Mělník on 1 September 2018.
Our company has... it has five members, but at the moment, there are only four people working in it.
We prepare new programs and offers for customers every month.
As an additional activity we also offer customers refreshments.

We look forward to meeting you.
Thank you. Thank you.
