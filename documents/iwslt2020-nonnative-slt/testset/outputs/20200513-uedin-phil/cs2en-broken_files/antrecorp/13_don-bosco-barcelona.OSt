I work at Hotel Bosco.
Our address is in Barcelona, in the heart of the city.
As you know well, Barcelona offers a large number of busy tourist places.
We're here to help you find these places and get to them.
Therefore, we offer you a car rental, but you can also use public transportation, which is located two minutes from our hotel.
We also offer a gym in case you want to practice your body.
We also have a conference room.
If you are entrepreneurs, then you have the opportunity to establish new business relationships here.
We also offer interesting spa and swimming pool.
So you can also rest in our hotel.
So that's about our hotel and you'll find us at stand number one hundred and five. If you want to come, I'd love to see you.
I hope you enjoyed my presentation and thank you for coming.
