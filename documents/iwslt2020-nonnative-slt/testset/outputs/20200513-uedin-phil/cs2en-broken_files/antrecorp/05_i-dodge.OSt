Nice weather is out there...
Yes, it's pretty hot.
Well, I think tonight's a good day to go out for dinner, don't you think?
Yes, but I don't know who you know about?
I know a wonderful Venetian entrepreneur.
Who's that?
He's standing right in front of you.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'll pick you up at eight o'clock tonight.
I didn't say yes.
Where can I pick you up with my Lamborghini?
What do you mean?
Like I said, yesterday my Lambo was sent to me by my company from Italy.
So you're in transport business?
Yes, I have a company based in Venice, called Idoge, we're in goods transport worldwide.
What's your company's name again?
We also sell machines for making pasta, Italian pasta.
Oh, that's interesting.
Not only that. We started in 2016 quite recently, but our customers trust us, we are famous for our professional approach and we receive a really excellent response and reviews from them.
That's why I'm inviting you to Mario's restaurant tonight so you can taste pasta made by our machine.
Boy, you obviously trust yourself too much.
That's because I'm proud of what I'm doing.
So you're gonna be waiting for me at home?
Oh, I'm so pleased with you, but I've got something else to do.
Yeah, I'm used to it.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
I'm sorry...
