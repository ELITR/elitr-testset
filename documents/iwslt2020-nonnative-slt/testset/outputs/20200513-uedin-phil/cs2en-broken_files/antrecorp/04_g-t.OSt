So, hello to everyone, my name is <NAME> and I want... I'd like to introduce you to G and T Ltd.
I'm a managing officer.
We are from the Czech Republic and we are pupils of the Business Academy.
The company's headquarters are in Neveklov.
I came here today to present myself to you... I want... I want to introduce my company.
Our company is a limited liability company, but we're not a big company.
Our company has seven employees and three departments.
We have a business department, a financial department, and then a management department.
Now I'd like to tell you what our company is making.
Our company makes advertisements for other companies.
We make stickers for cars, pencils and mugs, billboards and more.
We also produce advertising items.
These are, for example, visit cards and catalogues.
At the end of my presentation, I would like to thank you for your attention and invite you to our stand, which has number forty-seven.
Thank you. Thank you.
