Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
Our company is called Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on 15 May 2017 and was taken over by Mrs. <NAME> on 1 September 2018.
We sell dresses and suits of Czech designers and tailor workshops.
Our clothes and suits are made of recycled and natural materials.
We would also like to mention environmental problems in the fashion industry.
Fashion industry contributes most to environmental pollution.
And indeed... over 150 billion pieces of clothes are manufactured and other billions of clothes are... burned or buried in the pit.
By 2030, the fashion industry will grow as the population is increasing.
The typical clothing production cycle is as follows: obtaining materials for fabrics, fabrication of fabrics, fabrication of fabrics, preparation, i.e. dyeing and printing, and finally sewing and finishing of clothing.
Thank you for your attention, we wish you a good day.
