I'm tired.
The train service is so exhausting.
I have to sit somewhere.
Did I hear right?
You're looking for a comfortable walk, where could you sit and rest?
You're in the right place at the right time, and I'm probably the right person.
Another annoying salesman who wants to offer his products.
Wait, wait... before you get the wrong picture, let me introduce myself.
My name is <NAME> and I'm the director of the New Design World.
Our company was founded in 1981 in northeastern Italy by a group of young people who combine passion for furniture.
Our goal is to produce high quality and sophisticated products available to a wide range of users.
For example, our comfortable chairs are the perfect combination of beauty and elegance.
Oh, interesting.
Sounds like a good offer.
I was just about to improve my office, so go on.
We would like to offer something that focuses on the customer without forgetting the quality. So we would like to offer our sophisticated products.
And, so...
Would you be interested?
Yes, you convinced me.
Great!
Now that you've planned your office, why don't you take a look at our modern shelves and tables?
They are carefully selected, environmentally friendly and the whole production takes place in Italy, as with all our products.
