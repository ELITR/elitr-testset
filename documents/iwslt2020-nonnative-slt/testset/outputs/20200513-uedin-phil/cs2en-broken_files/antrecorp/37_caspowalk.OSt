Hello! Hello!
What floor are you going to?
Hello, until the fifteen.
And you?
By the twenty-two.
Do you mind if I take my shoes off?
Those high heels are killing me!
Of course you do.
I don't mind.
Thank you. Thank you.
Why do you wear those high heels when you can wear sneakers?
I know a good shop that's focused on selling leisure shoes.
Oh, really?
Yes, I actually work for him.
His name is CaspoWalk Ltd. and we offer different types of shoes from different brands such as Nike, Adidas, for all ages and gender.
Do you also offer some special shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some pairs of shoes.
The special offer of this month is Danish-style woods, and if you like sport, you would like Nike's new shoes called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes you can control with your phone.
You can adjust your lace binding and the color of LEDs using the mobile application.
If I buy shoes at your place, will you offer me some accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer shoes and shoe inserts and many other accessories.
Here's my card.
You'll be sure to stop by our store.
All right, thank you.
You can find us in this building.
We're participating in the fair of student companies.
Thank you so much!
We got up to my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
Bye-bye.
Nice to meet you, too.
Bye-bye.
