Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hi.
Oh, that's a very nice shirt.
What kind of brand is that?
Oh, it's not a brand, it's my shoe logo.
Really? Yeah.
You have a shoe?
Yes, sure.
Located in Vltava in the heart of České Budějovice, we offer three classes of rooms.
First class is called Golden Fish and belongs to the most luxurious room in our botel.
Then we have the second class, the Silver Fish, and the third class called the Bronze Fish.
I mean, are you offering some special rooms?
Yes, that's what we offer.
We have a special room designed for loving couples to celebrate anniversary and so on.
I mean, do you have a restaurant?
Yes, we do.
We have a restaurant for customers, where the public can go, but our customers eat for free.
And if you stay in our restaurant longer than you wanted -- well, you know, that can happen -- then you can use our fitness center with the latest equipment.
I mean, I'm sorry, but I don't like fitness, you don't offer massage...
Well, if you are not really attracted to fitness, then you can visit our relaxation center, where we offer massage, sauna, lava stone massage and more.
Wow, that's right, I like that, great!
And as far as I can add, there is free Wi-Fi access and free parking for guests throughout the botel.
Wow, thank you.
I hope you visit us.
Definitely.
