I am now giving the floor to Mr Mayrbeurle.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
It is a great honor for me to be able to speak here.
I will try to introduce you here briefly to our instrument for large amounts of data, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
So before I really start, I would like to inform you about the situation in the largest municipalities of Austria.
These are municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants and since two thousand eleven we have been entitled to control all these local authorities.
Before that, the threshold was 20,000.
Thus, gray points represent more than twenty thousand inhabitants and blue less than twenty thousand.
The explanation is still in German.
I'm sorry about that.
We are therefore entitled to carry out an audit of seventy-five municipalities in total.
This represents about 3.2 percent of the total municipalities
However, we provide advice to all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, we in our department decided to develop a special tool that we call the Instrument for the Monitoring of Municipalities.
The development team consists of three young economists who work in our department. I am one of them.
We all three use this tool for different purposes.
So what was the objective of this instrument, why was it even created?
The main reason was the effort to find an analytical tool for evaluating financial risk.
So first we try to design a profile for each village.
Taking into account all relevant factors.
In the second step, we assess the municipalities in view of their importance for the auditing activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we classify municipalities according to financial risk on the basis of certain indicators.
The order is always interesting, it is the most interesting of all of this, because it gives us the opportunity to compare all the villages.
Thank you. Thank you.
The hardest task of each database project is to collect quality data.
We heard about it a day earlier.
In this context, we must mention that the statistics of Austria, which is an Austrian statistical agency, are very helpful for us, and that agency is our most important partner in this project.
We got the following data from them.
These data are actually available to every citizen.
But if you want aggregate data, you have to buy it from the Statistics of Austria.
And only aggregated data are useful for analysis.
So we have cross-sectional accounts of budgets and accounting regulations.
We have detailed information about closed accounts, so we have accounts at the level of free tickets.
And then we have debt and liabilities statements.
We therefore mainly use financial and accounting data, but of course we have in particular population data and other data from the statistics of Austria.
Now we have data from this period from two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen.
And that's a mistake, for which I'm sorry.
We keep updating these data, always every autumn.
Since we have data from the accounting systems of the municipalities, we have no data on the contribution of the municipality, we have no data on rental obligations, and we have no data on balances and assets, because the municipalities do not publish these data.
This is important because in practice you have an official accountant in the municipality, you find some amount of debt, and if you look at the company's contributions to the municipality, you may find this debt value here again, so it will be a duplication and if you're just checking the accounts of the municipality itself, you only have half of it.
So from the current data, we think our indicators are good, which I will explain later, and we will try to create an indicator model, and this monitoring is based on a model consisting of indicators that are drawn up as an evaluation indicator broken down by topics.
Statistics are derived from this from one to a hundred, which is most relevant for the audit.
This model thus allows indicators to be assessed by themes.
And in order to determine the relevance for the audit, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses financial situation indicators as a basic setting, but depending on the question raised, depending on the subject of the audit, you can choose different settings of indicators.
Then you get a different result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four topics and the first is the financial situation in the long term.
That means we take net debt plus liabilities minus securities holdings and minus reserves.
So the first of them gives us a long-term perspective, which means debt minus assets.
And the other one gives us a short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we are defining the basic balance, which is current revenue without transfers minus current expenditure without transfers and income.
This is an important point in the indicator model, because we do not use the key data that I have expressed per capita.
We use a different figure as a relevant figure, namely our own revenue, because it is better to show the economic strength of the municipality.
Furthermore, the administrative structure comes to the line.
There we simply put together administrative expenditure and personal expenditure.
Personal data is the most challenging task for us.
We tried to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And yes, we take account of other accounts, various accounts, representation and analysis of special accounts.
This means that using these data we are trying to find accounting errors.
This image is therefore a screenshot of one possible output of the monitoring tool
And here you see the villages that are at the end of the list, from the best to the worst.
The black column thus shows value and it is given the importance of auditing activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors. In this picture it is therefore assessed for the importance of auditing for our department.
So the four columns on the right are indicators.
Indicators of the model I explained earlier.
The black column shows the value of three whole thirty-three, which is the village of Halvank, a small village near Salzburg and is the best village.
So this is a scale.
So if you want to audit the municipality with the best financial situation, we will audit Halvanka.
If you want to audit the worst village, just skip the picture and get to the last, but today I don't want to show you these villages.
In our system we have all the Austrian municipalities, but not every municipality falls within our assessment obligations, so only the second, yes, we can audit only the second.
We try to compare villages with the same class of villages of the same size, so we do not compare Vienna with Halvanko. We try to find similar villages to make this comparison fair.
So we have many different output options for this tool, and another function is this output diary for each individual municipality.
So we have the village of Halvank, for example.
We can make such a diary for every municipality in Austria and, as you can see, you will not be able to read it, but it will provide a wide range of key figures, indicators, graphs and information on the financial situation and its development.
The next output of the diary is these two pages, where you can see, for example, an analysis of personal expenditure on the left, that's the red line of the chart.
And when compared to other municipalities, you can choose a blue line, and where the red line exceeds the blue line, the village is worse.
Or
Therefore, you can easily assess whether the municipality has excessive expenditure.
And on the right-hand side, we have transfers, which means we have outgoing and ingoing money from the village perspective.
But these are only two outputs of many.
We are currently using some statistical programmes, such as R Stat Plus, and we can carry out any analysis that is necessary - what our superiors want us to do.
As you can see, we use this audit planning tool, preparation, operational affairs and on request, which means that if someone wants to use this village only for presentation, they can use the diary.
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in the region, we can do this, and this information helps us not only in the audit itself.
And in accordance with our advisory approach, we provide the municipalities with concrete information.
This means that if some mayor calls us and wants to know about his village and what their financial situation is in this village, we can provide them with reports and journals.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you. Thank you.
