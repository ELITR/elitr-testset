<CENSORED>, are you receiving?
Should I start?
Yes, I did.
Yeah, ha ha ha, sorry.
First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your electronic data conference.
The right to access government information is a fundamental democratic right.
To do so, the government must share public information.
Since the law came into force, the company has changed a lot.
Information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
Over time, virtually all people began to use the Internet, often on multiple devices.
The 21st-century government can respond to these tasks by giving the public direct access to government information.
In other words, the government could actively publish open data.
In such a case, the volume of open data should be assessed in the context of the transition to digital administration.
The pace in this area is set here by the United Kingdom, along with the US.
Clearly, open data is not seen by these countries as an objective, but as a means to achieve greater transparency.
From a global point of view, they are leading in terms of an open government partnership.
This is an initiative to get the government to be as open as possible.
And there are several European directives and treaties in Europe that are important for the legislation and policy of open data.
The Dutch Government is also very ambitious in terms of open data and has adopted new rules.
The real implementation, however, is still under way.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former President, Mrs Stuiveling, see great potential in open data.
In 2013, we decided to follow the development of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We have conducted a survey focused on the determination of ministries to implement an open data policy.
Our approach is positive because we have focused on ministries that have done well and, on the contrary, we have tried to encourage ministries that have left behind.
Through meetings with experts on open data and civil servants and the publication of information sheets with good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we emphasised the importance of open data and followed progress.
We have identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers the government opportunities.
By openly informing the government about its spending and performance, it will have a better idea of its own financing.
This will change the way Parliament oversees the government.
Open data sets would increase the transparency and accessibility of the government to citizens.
From a commercial point of view, innovative entrepreneurs can convert open data to new applications.
One of our goals was to find out what the Netherlands could learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Using data for an open data biometry performed by the World Web Foundation, we have compared three aspects of open data.
Awareness of achieving positive results from government initiatives on open data.
The extent to which open data are available.
And impact on society, economy, and government.
Uh, the company, the economy and the government.
And if we compare-- excuse me.
I'm sorry.
My voice's kind of tied up in the monitor.
It's really disturbing me.
It's all right.
We can go on.
If we compare the UK and the United States with the Netherlands,
The UK and the US are based on this in terms of implementation and impact better.
As far as their preparedness for open data is concerned, there is little difference between them.
On the other hand, the Netherlands is much worse prepared.
This only concerns the right to information and the extent to which the government supports initiatives in the field of open data.
As regards availability, the United Kingdom and the United States are publishing much more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data sets is huge in the United States.
The type of data that countries publish differs in the number of points.
The Netherlands is currently publishing little open data on government expenditure and public procurement.
Even the Dutch trade register is not very open.
As you can see, the UK, on the other hand, has open data in all areas.
The impact of open data has a political, social and economic dimension.
From a social and economic point of view, the Netherlands is lagging behind both Great Britain and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands less uses open data to involve citizens in making and controlling government policy.
The economic benefits of open data are very small.
In both of our reports, we have given international examples that can be a good example for the Netherlands.
In Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on the waiting periods of hospitals.
We didn't rely only on open data barometers
And we did our own research.
And to get a better picture of the currently available volume and the type of open data.
We looked at the data published on our national open data portal.
In total, in February two thousand fifteen were available three thousand two hundred sets of data.
And a little more than half of the data sets were provided by the central government.
The majority of the open data published by the central government comes from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands is the public work of the Ministry.
In the case of our two reports, we have asked all ministries what steps they are taking to publish open data.
The score that we awarded to each ministry was based on six indicators.
These were, for example, the support from the management of the Ministry and the action plan of the entity.
Since our first report was published, some ministries have taken exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and what funds they provided in the year two thousand fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice did not have time or money to publish public data.
However, other ministries commissioned several staff to publish open data and released the budget for these activities.
Based on the examination of the years of two thousand thirteen and fourteen, we have come to the conclusion that open data is the standard but are not yet applied in practice.
And given what was established in the area of open data, it was mainly about the government, what the government knew, rather than what the government was doing.
We also received a few comments that rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should better inform about the data available.
They should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third was that the government had to invest in both, both on the supply and demand of open data.
For example, by setting up an Institute for Open Data.
For our report for the year two thousand fifteen, we have discovered that the government and ministries have taken steps to widerly accept open data.
And partly in response to our first report on open data, the Interior Ministry is currently coordinating the entire government analysis of the data set.
The Netherlands follows the good examples set by Great Britain and the United States.
There was a disadvantage.
We have also found that the open data provided through the national portal was unilateral.
Practically all open data sets are geo data, geographic data and almost all are published by a single ministry.
Very few data are important, which are important for public control of government finances, and government action is available.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account for the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch Government should therefore define targets and milestones in a specific action plan.
We also believe that the opening of data should be compulsory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
This should specify which data are of the highest social importance and which data should in any case be made available.
And the government itself should use open data, for example in decentralising social networks.
In the Netherlands, this is a large national programme under which responsibility is transferred from the central government to municipalities.
Our reports have had a positive impact.
The Ministry of the Interior will publish the results of the national data survey this month.
The House of Representatives adopted a proposal for a national information infrastructure.
And based on the data inventory, the Home Affairs Ministry will set up a national open data agenda.
In this agenda, it will publish what data will be opened and when they will be opened.
We are trying to set an example.
We have published our own expenditure on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors is spending their money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open expenditure.
The Ministry of Finance is now planning to make details of expenditure available to the government next year.
It's all right.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is developing positively and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor developments,
Thank you for your attention.
If you are interested, you can find our reports on our website in English and data on our expenditure in Dutch.
