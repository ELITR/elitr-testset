Well, if you'll excuse me.
I would like to ask our Polish colleagues to give their presentation.
Thank you. Thank you.
And to refresh my memory, I would like to say a few words about the new regulations and the new instruments that were introduced last year and this year.
We introduced you to some of these at our last plenary session in Warsaw.
So those of you who were in Warsaw should know something about this.
So I would briefly remind you of some of them, and then I will tell you about our previous audit in this area and our conclusions.
First of all, I would like to mention the single audit package.
We started introducing these instruments three years ago.
Last year, however, the final phase took place, because the first phase was that the single audit package had to be mandatory on request submitted to the tax authorities.
And now it's an automatic system.
The information shall be submitted electronically without any request.
And since July 1 last year
This is mandatory for all types of operators.
Since 2016.
it was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, smaller and now for all businesses.
I will also come back to that, because we consider it crucial in the fight against VAT reductions.
The second legislation I would like to mention is the so-called ‘fuel package’ and, in this case, the regulation has been introduced gradually.
It depends on the type of undertaking and its main idea is that fuel trading licences are granted only to companies having their headquarters in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign companies are registered for VAT in their own countries, the same types of companies can benefit from their practices of suspension of excise duty, which respect the intra-Community purchase of fuel, and VAT resulting from the intra-Community purchase of fuel will have to be paid immediately after the goods have been dispatched to Poland or after
Another regulation is the transport package.
It must be said that the draft law is based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this type has been introduced in Hungary and in Poland we have introduced this system of monitoring goods transport only for certain categories of goods.
In general, they are goods on which excise duty is levied.
I am referring to fuel, tobacco and some others, and I am referring to monitoring how these goods are transported by road or rail.
This means that each individual transport must be reported before the start of the transport, in a separate system, a dedicated system and, since last year, each transport has been connected to the geolocation system.
So for each individual truck, you can determine where it is right now.
Roads, parking, etc.
And the Minister of Finance for the Ministry of Finance, which analyzes the entire system of large data that has been delivered online, some of the public institutions, and as we know, there may be a lot of results, and there may be some inconsistencies in many, and many could find a business entity that provides them with this transport in a way that is abnormal in terms of routes, time, etc.
And this year, we're planning to carry out an audit of the Treasury.
How the Treasury is prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is in place in the sense that all these companies must register all transport and the system is prepared in the sense of an analysis that is carried out online.
However, we do not know yet whether the Minister of Finance will use this information for any action taken by the tax authorities.
Another legislation is to some extent similar to that presented yesterday by our colleague, who specializes in technical issues.
So we have a certain black list, but in Poland, the term black list means the list of entities that have been removed from the VAT record.
And we have an information-based system, again given online banks and other financial system entities.
This system may be used by the Treasury Minister to identify possible irregularities and problems, and it aims to capture unusual transactions and provide information on them online to the tax authorities.
And on the basis of this information, the tax office can block an account, a bank account, and a specific transaction.
What is the risk of enforcement of a higher fine than, let's say, EUR 10,000.
Another legislation is the distribution of payments that was introduced last year.
At the moment, it's optional.
But actually, it depends on the buyer.
If one contracting party uses it, then the method of payment for the supplier, of course, is mandatory.
What is important is that if this payment allocation mechanism is applied, the joint and solidary liability of the taxpayer is excluded.
I'll show you some numbers, and I'll tell you in a little bit about how this distribution can be used in the payment mechanism.
Finally, there is one legislative and organisational instrument that was presented in quite detail last year by our colleague from the Ministry of Finance.
Therefore, we have a new national income administration, based on previous free administration, and now we have another administration that is fighting tax and customs administration in one system.
Plus the online registration system
Ha ha ha.
At the moment, we have a compulsory type of registration box system and the compulsory element of these registration boxes is electronic memory.
The tax office is therefore able to verify authorized types of registration boxes on the basis of memory, but we are starting with an online registration system only for certain sectors.
These are first and foremost legal services, medical services, only certain specific sectors.
This implies that we need to start working on the creation of a central system led by the head of the national income management.
In this system, all these transactions should be registered immediately and simply online.
That is why we are starting this debate so that we can introduce possible distribution of payments to all taxpayers affected.
In fact, this means that we would like the tax authorities to wish to replace the reverse tax liability by this mechanism of allocation of payments and reverse tax liability and joint and solidary responsibility.
Thus, in all sectors where transferred tax liability or joint and indivisible liability is binding, all of these sectors could be subject to this payment allocation mechanism.
Now, as I have already mentioned, I will tell you about our audit.
We audited last year.
The period during which the audit was carried out was relatively long - it was twelve years, and that is why we were asked by the Committee on Public Finance of the same Polish Chamber of Parliament to carry out such an audit.
We have reached the following conclusions.
We had to say that the effectiveness of the work of the Ministry of Finance was very fluctuating over this long period.
In our view, between 2010 and 2015, the Ministry and the tax authorities have made somewhat poor efforts to improve their VAT revenue efficiency.
Since the audit was carried out by the Ministry of Finance on the supervision of tax revenue or the collection of taxes, namely the collection of VAT, this was reflected here.
One of the signs of this volatility in the efficiency of work is
so-called VAT GAP.
And during those years, the VAT GAP in Poland was on average 24 percent, which was about ten points more than the median of the EU countries.
Among other things, we have concluded that the supervision has not been effectively contacted.
So that's how it is.
We can say that we have information about VAT GAP in Poland and EU countries and that we have figures from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And, as you can see, the average difference between the VAT GAP in Europe is certainly lower than in Poland; although we do not take into account the source of information, the figures are quite clear.
Mmmm.
I have already mentioned that our main instrument and main instrument for the tax authorities, as well as the idea that has been put into practice during this period, was the single audit package, and over the last two years the tax authorities have acquired competences to use databases to analyse them.
For example, in 2017, four million invoices were automatically analysed, but only 3,300 warnings were issued on the basis of these analyses.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed did not increase much - it was about five million, but the analysis brought more than 350,000 warnings.
This has been reflected in receipts because the first stage is automatic analysis and then comes a warning sent via SMS or e-mail.
So without any administrative proceedings in tax proceedings, etc.
And this system, or its first phase, the automatic phase, has brought us additional revenue, VAT revenue worth more than EUR 150 million a year.
I am talking about the figures for 2017 and 2018.
It should be noted that income increased in good economic conditions and improved VAT collection as a result of the extensive package of legislative and organisational changes introduced in recent years.
Nevertheless, we believe that one of the main sources of these results, these financial results, is precisely the introduction of this single audit package.
As a result of another instrument, this mechanism for allocation of payments in 2018 followed the application of the allocation mechanism, which, as I mentioned earlier, was optional.
However, we observe an increased interest in making payments in this way.
In July last year, the taxpayers carried out 600,000 transactions.
In December, more than one and a half million transactions were made through the allocated payment mechanism.
The value of the tax paid under this allocated payment mechanism in July was half a billion euro.
And half a billion euros on 1 December.
Overall, for the period from July to December last year, the taxpayers carried out more than seven million transactions through the payment allocation mechanism and the amount of tax in the VAT special accounts reached around six billion euro.
And one more information about the work of the tax authorities, last year, the tax authorities and the Ministry carried out 30 percent fewer checks than in 2017, but with fewer checks, the percentage of checks that were detected in irregularities increased.
In our view, this is the result of the new electronic tools introduced, which have helped to better select the entities to be checked.
It is clear that the reduction in the number of checks has been achieved by the reduction in the number of checks being accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is obviously less painful and time-consuming for taxpayers.
This led to an increase in the findings by 100 percent last year compared to 2017.
So in general, we believe that several legislative instruments have been introduced over the past few years.
In summary, the results are thus sufficient.
However, we must not forget that this has been done in economically favourable conditions.
So it's impossible to determine exactly what part of these income increases were caused by which factor.
If this is the result of new organisational and legislative instruments
or whether it is the overall economic situation.
That's all.
Thank you. Thank you.
If you have any questions, please ask.
