So we would like to continue and kindly ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to deliver a presentation.
All right, here I am presenting our current state.
We have two national laws to make European regulation two directives.
One is about paper and digital publications.
Now they have the same rate.
And in certain circumstances, it's zero rate, but in other circumstances it's six percent.
In the case of rental of real estate, we accepted ... the possibility of rental of real estate ... and the compulsory VAT on short-term rental of real estate.
Then we did two audits.
One concerns ... which we have heard several times before, so I will be very brief about it.
The second concerns the registration treasury system.
And then we also have two new four trends.
Our audit on the MOS... is not yet completed and is not even published.
Therefore, all the conclusions and recommendations are only preliminary.
But we are almost certain that there will be no more major changes.
Hmmm.
Our conclusions are essentially identical to what we have heard here today.
But as far as we are concerned, I will just point out some things that are different, but which, in my view, are more or less specific to Belgium.
We currently have only a limited number of employees in the administration, because we are more or less a recipient, unlike MSID, which transfers money, and we depend considerably on other Member States.
But in the future, when the MOS is expanding most, more employees will be needed.
And they should now be trained and known in advance.
Another general conclusion that we have drawn, but which has also been said here, is that there have been changes in the control strategies.
What has to happen is a new direction of thinking.
But our administration strongly believes in another MSID, because if we look at conclusions like MSCON...
Just skip from one to the other.
So we see that there is a very poor control strategy.
We therefore strongly believe that every MSID will send or transfer money.
It's up to us.
Nevertheless, we have highlighted the importance of making progress in the field of control strategy by creating risk profiles.
Our administration has not yet been able to create good risk profiles because they don't have enough data, but they think they will in the future.
I have more data in the future and I could create certain risk profiles, so that in the future we will be monitoring whether the control policy will improve.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We are following other taxpayers on the Internet, so there is a system to find taxpayers on the Internet.
But for now, the results are rather bad.
There is not much about taxpayers that can be traced.
Then we see that...
The MSIDD registration procedure is fine as such, but in the circumstances where taxpayers are cancelled...
There are no follow-up measures if they submit a declaration in the ordinary system.
There is therefore no link or any subsequent system, which we think is important.
Then we have... in the confession process.
There are some automatic checks, which we find very interesting.
So this is not a real check of completeness and correctness (yes, thank you) of completeness and correctness.
But it still helps when there are common mistakes.
Therefore, the actual checks must be carried out by the MSCON, but as a MSID, but Belgium is still helping to fill in the declarations, so there are certain errors.
There will be a warning in the system, or if you have to make a selection and all options will be limited, just click on possible options, so there will be fewer errors.
As a MSCON, we also found that they worked in Benelux.
So, together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they have created a matrix of certain risks and are developing new control activities.
As a function of these risks and there are already two test sets that have begun so far.
We therefore recommend that we continue to work in this small group in order to make progress and expand knowledge to European forums.
I think it's the differences that we've had, unlike what we haven't heard before.
So we're going to do a second audit.
An audit of the registration boxes system has been carried out.
This is not an audit carried out by Luden and me, but carried out by other members of the audit cell.
It was also an audit that was slightly wider than VT, but I will only present conclusions and recommendations that are important for VT.
The audit focused on the effectiveness and effectiveness of the audit policy.
Installation and application, so they looked at two problems related to the registration boxes system.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations they have reached are that the regulation is too complex.
They therefore recommend simplification because there are too many derogations in the regulation in the national regulation.
That it was very difficult to establish a particular group only on the basis of the statement itself.
Therefore, it was very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that had to install the registration boxes system.
Another major conclusion was control policy.
There are problems with the collection of taxpayers by the taxpayers' registration treasury system.
If there was a limit, there's a limit, and if the confession is too low, then you fall below that limit, and there's no control here, so this was the way to escape the legislation.
There was also a problem with cross-checks of information data from databases for the selection of taxpayers for their control.
Another conclusion was that there were poor internal controls for the application of the system.
As regards the fines that were imposed, they found that different control units had imposed different fines.
There were therefore no rules on fines, but some were very strict and other control teams were not strict at all, or they had fines much lower than the rates that they paid for certain mistakes, also risk analysis and online access.
It would be an advantage, but it's not being implemented now, so the risk analysis was very simple and there's no online access, but once we learned that this type of system exists in other countries when they have online access.
They found that this could be a very good advantage.
Then there was also an exchange of information with the national social security office, which was not very good.
So a lot of information didn't get from one to the other.
Finally, about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with loading transactions
The system as such works very well when it is used when it is used, as if it was supposed to be used, but when certain transactions were not entered into the system, they could not be discovered.
So the solution could be to create a media campaign so that customers can request a ticket.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise, it will not be a ticket or that legislation would be adapted to the fact that only electronic payments would be accepted, because then it would be easier to track money.
But there is no reliable measurement of impact management as a real impact, so they have no idea.
Our team then performed several tests and tried to find an impact, but they discovered that there was an effect of expectation because the implementation of the system was postponed by several years.
However, everyone knew that this was coming, so customers and companies were already expecting legislation that was about to change and introduce this system.
The exact differences between VAT revenue before 2016, when the system was introduced and then, were therefore very difficult to trace.
Since already a few years before 2016, VAT returns were increasing with regard to a new system that would be subject to amendments.
Our team wasn't sure about the effect.
It's just about this system or the fact that the effect was even greater because it started sooner than they thought.
Look, I can interrupt you, just, I have a problem, or I'd like to understand it right.
What am I supposed to imagine as a system of registration treasures?
Does that mean that this treasury system is registered somewhere in the database?
No, it's not, it's online, it's cash cash, yeah "cash".
Oh, okay, so it's just for cafes, hotels and restaurants.
It's only for a particular sector.
So far, it is only in the Horeca sector and it is a system that registers every transaction or should register every projection that is inserted into the system.
(So) There is no online access.
That is why the selection of the control group is so important, because the control teams have to go to different places.
They can't focus on it online on the computer, they have to go to HoReCa and connect their computer to the cashier.
To get the data out of it and check it out.
Yes, but they can't do it from a distance.
They must always reach the establishment on their own.
So that's why the confession is too low and below the limit.
Teams won't go there to see if they know the cafe, for example, and they know that there are lots of customers and they're not there, but that's just a coincidence.
But that's something they found out later, so it's gonna be them.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was afraid that I was the only one who didn't understand.
All right, but what's the difference between this system, which you're talking about at any dealer's registration office, I mean in the food?
So what's so strange about this particular system that you're there.
There's a special software that offers any possibility of fraud with the system and it's also a software that ensures that the data can be transferred to the computer of the control teams.
While you can't extract data in the same way in the ordinary system of registration boxes.
So these are the registration treasury systems they have.
Yes, they are also special, but I think there are five different stamps of registration treasury systems, from which you can choose and have a certification.
That all data that can be extracted in data formats are suitable for analysis by the control teams.
Yeah, yes, so compatibility is certified, which is the main part of the domain of the different sections.
Yes, you have mentioned this risk analysis that risk services analysis is missing or have not all been carried out or.
I mean online access to this analysis or?
Online access to your own registration treasury system.
Okay, so which checks could be much easier, well, and because we can do automatic checks or extract data.
Which could be inserted into a larger system and the risk analysis was actually very basic because they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or this system was only introduced in 2016, so they had only two years of data at their disposal.
Okay, to conclude.
I have two new fraudulent trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called Matrimony, which consisted of registering a large number of foreign companies.
But always the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulgarian.
But they registered to names that were very similar to known names.
There was only a difference in one letter, just to make it plausible to assume that these companies existed, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they only lodged a VAT statement and requested VAT refund with false invoices, but they always made this statement in writing and for very small amounts.
Which means the administration had to put all the information into the system, which took time.
Therefore, some reimbursements have already been made before they could actually find out that there was a possibility of fraud and they could check whether the company actually existed and whether those invoices were real.
However, this type of fraud has been discovered and information about it has already been spread through the Eurofisc, so I think that any tax administration is already informed of this type of fraud.
Another fraud consisted of green energy certificates, which were very similar to previous CO3-2 certificates.
The fraudulent plan was more or less the same as sending invoices.
Or they used invoices of a company that was very similar to a law firm that was supposed to send invoices.
So we had a fraud plan, and I shortened it a lot, and I don't have a picture of it.
But let me explain it this way.
There was a company A in a Member State X, which, according to certificates from B in another Member State A, sold these certificates to C.
Again another Member State Z and sent to this company an invoice from the corresponding A with a comma...
So that's the name of the company that only differs in one letter from the original.
So, company C would not see that there is actually a fraud.
And of course, A and A were the same managers that have this company A, and A with the point would be the missing trader.
I hope this type of fraud is clear.
And that was the end of my presentation.
