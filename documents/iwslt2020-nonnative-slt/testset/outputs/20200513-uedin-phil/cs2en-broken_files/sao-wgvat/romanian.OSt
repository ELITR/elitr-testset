Do you have any more questions?
If not, I would like to ask our Romanian colleagues to speak.
All right, hello.
Do you all hear me right?
Yes? Yes?
So we have been introducing 19 percent of VAT in Romania for two years now.
And although plans to reduce to 18 percent have emerged, they have been postponed for now.
In addition, we have two reduced VAT rates, nine percent and five percent.
There have been several changes in the past year in terms of products which may have a reduced rate.
So the biggest change in the sewer service, where the rate has been reduced from nineteen percent to nine percent since January 1st of this year.
Other items remain unchanged.
On the other hand, there have been a lot of changes in the 5% rate, especially in some products that were at nine percent, and now they have been converted to five percent.
The biggest change has occurred last 1 June this year; it concerns high-quality food and mountain products, as well as traditional products.
And for products manufactured on the mountains, cows or sheep that produce them have to live there at least half of their lives.
The manufacturer has to get them an authorisation, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
Then he will be able to apply a reduced rate.
Then we have a transferred tax liability mechanism.
In Romania, both companies must be registered in order to be able to use this system.
There are fourteen products for which this can be shortened, and in December two thousand eighteen had to be extended to twenty-two for some of them.
Finally, the value added tax distribution system that was introduced in two thousand seventeen, although it now seems that the Treasury has somewhat forgotten about it.
In the year two thousand seventeen it started with more than four hundred companies and now in the year two thousand nineteen their number fell to forty-six percent.
Moreover, in the year two thousand eighteen, no new companies started to use this system.
So all the companies that started it have since then begun to return from this system to the normal VAT system.
Moreover, the European Commission has ordered Romania to cease using this system.
It seems, therefore, that the system has not fulfilled what was expected of it, so the Ministry is likely to cease to use it fully.
Completely?
I am based on the data that we have at our disposal because in the year two thousand eighteen, or in the year two thousand nineteen, no new companies were registered.
So there are only companies in the system that started in two thousand seventeen, and their number is slowly declining.
As regards all these findings, there are still certain regulatory gaps with regard to the MOSS system, which, for some reason, is referred to in Romania as M1SS because it has been translated.
But that's just how it is.
In addition, we lack IT systems at the tax offices that can work together and exchange data.
This will not make the situation easier for companies, and last year we finally introduced an electronic system like that in Belgium.
They have introduced electronic registration treasures and companies are now obliged to start using them, so the tax authorities check that all companies have them installed.
However, we are not yet sure that the system is fully operational due to the limits in the IT system of the tax authorities.
And so far, no new trends have been detected.
So, that's all.
Thank you. Thank you.
