Okay, so we did this audit.
The audit report will be published on 16 July.
That's why you keep this information secret.
They are subject to an information embargo until the date of publication.
We are waiting for a Commission response in all 23 official EU languages.
Because we only have an answer in English, so it's just a formality and the audit is now over.
The title was ‘Many challenges...’ and the special report will be ‘Many challenges remain to be addressed in collecting VAT on customs duties’.
There's a solution left.
Originally, it was supposed to be ‘It would need to be addressed’, but some have already been addressed to some extent through new legislation, a new Commission proposal, which has just been mentioned by <CENSORED>.
However, there are still problems that remain to be solved, so we will see later.
So I'll start with why we chose this subject of audit.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
And we will conclude with our recommendations.
First of all, okay, we did a survey because we follow up on previous research analyses.
Based on the findings of the head of these institutions in the field of e-commerce, German colleagues, Lithuanian colleagues, carried out audits.
In the previous decision on imports, we also analyze the issue of distance from non-EU countries and the related VAT and customs issues, and we decided that it was worth going deeper during this audit.
The problem is that honest traders are often excluded from the market by dishonest traders and are no longer able to compete.
This is a problem raised by representatives of the academic community, such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and is particularly intense in the United Kingdom.
Also estimates of losses.
There are only estimates of distances from non-EU countries.
But these estimates are not very encouraging, because, although the committee estimates only five billion per year, it is between £1 billion and £1.5 billion per year in the United Kingdom.
This is how they estimated the losses.
This represents a reduction of 8 to 10 % in VAT in the United Kingdom.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently represents only four percent.
So the triple of the fight against fraud in the United Kingdom represents the amount of losses in e-commerce in goods purchased from third countries.
This is a mission.
We are not counting distance sales within the EU here, we are not counting most electronic services here.
So the basis is to highlight our concerns.
Then what we are focusing on is visiting five Member States - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why have we taken into account the number of registrations for the MOS system, both in programmes outside the EU and in the US.
Also, the volume of electronic sales within the EU and finally the estimated amount of VAT lost as a result of the VAT exemption on imports of goods of minor value (LVCR).
Following a study of our source in the committee, we also visited the committee.
These steps should discourage technology and the World Customs Organisation and the cancelled period lasted from 2015 to the end of 2018.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal tabled and all the proposals that will enter into force in 2021.
What are we focusing on?
Of course, we started analysing the answers to our survey, the survey sent by the main group two.
We are continuing the questionnaire in all the Member States we have visited to interviews with all kinds of people.
We have obtained access, and what is also very important, we have set up access to ABC data to the Synergia database, i.e. the incident database, the problems that Member States report in the MOS system.
We have access to all project groups fiscali (fiscal) and electronic groups related to e-commerce, and to all project groups related to the BUT, where there is plenty of information and discussion about the functioning of the MOS system.
And, of course, we got funding from the support of institutions from Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and finally we made our own samples of various transactions.
Overall, we collected nearly nine hundred transactions related to e-commerce.
What we find, of course, was first positive things, and then we will continue with the most negative ones.
The regulatory framework is governed by the best international practices of the OECD and the World Customs Organisation’s extremes.
In most aspects relating to the OECD, the principle of taxation at destination has been observed in most cases, except in this principle.
There is now a new threshold below EUR 10,000 that you can apply in the Member State of origin, so this is not in line with the OECD.
In the case of the World Customs Organisation, which deals with imported packages, the guidelines for immediate release have been followed in most respects, as well as a new proposal within the framework of standards.
The Commission is a pioneer in this area and, in most respects, is adapting to the World Customs Organisation and standards.
As regards the new provision, which will enter into force in 2021...
I am trying to solve some weaknesses, but for us, the main problem that will continue to arise is underestimation.
The loss of VAT and customs duties is and will continue.
This cannot be addressed by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As far as trade with countries outside the EU is concerned, this will not be solved, and later we will also see why.
Why is it, because the cooperation agreements between administrative authorities and third countries are not working.
We have a new deal with Norway.
We expect a change of information with Norway that this will work, but that is no problem.
It's not Norway, it's China, it's the United States of America.
The information chain does not work with China because the Chinese counterpart does not respond and the response rate is falling and falling, so that is the problem.
If we have information about changing supplier who does not work using an electronic interface, i.e. he works directly on his website, who has not registered in the MOS or even registered and after we cancel registration, he opens a new website...
So why are we paying VAT from Europe to China and expecting VAT to return to the EU?
Unless we also have administrative cooperation.
That's never gonna happen.
This is a problem among the EU countries, it does not work as expected.
Administrative cooperation also, so we will see later that the controls carried out by the national tax authorities are weak.
Because there are virtually no tools to carry out a proper analysis of the risk of accident, which has already been mentioned.
It will therefore be necessary for a Member State to approve the Commission's proposal to amend the information, with insufficient payment service providers subject to the Commission's control.
And we'll see later, of course, the committee did not perform any monitoring, no monitoring.
There are weaknesses in their own electronic check-in systems.
The traditional problem, of course, is that traders underestimated goods in order to remain below the euro threshold for twenty-two or ten years of VAT.
And this will disappear in the future, but they will continue to underestimate to pay lower VAT.
This will not be approved, but they will pay less, and as far as customs duties are concerned, the assumption is set at EUR 150 and they cannot handle it.
Because in all electronics... we'll see the EU electronic clearing system later, they can't stop the declaration.
Because they check the box they own an electronic... which they apply to the customer electronically for relief.
And they promoted the system, even though they declared a value that was above a hundred and fifty.
The electronic system cannot stop this, they said it was something very serious, because the operators that work there are promising economic operators.
So, big couriers have the authority of an association of economic operators, and they say they're the most reliable, but they're abusing of this system.
Enforcement of VAT customs duties is not effective.
Okay, provisions on a chain of information on recovery claims related to this tax.
They have rarely been used, from the five Member States we have visited, only in Austria.
Only in five cases, so it's not often used.
We are analysing the inconsistencies of payments between Member States.
We have access to the harmonisation carried out by the Commission and there are still overlooked combinations.
It means a lot between Member States.
Of course, the problem in the Netherlands is that they are unable to harmonise, which explains the amounts of VAT received with the VAT declaration.
And there are also problems with the reminders that our colleagues at the NKU yesterday...
They assumed a problem with the comments of the Member States on consumption that are not ...
Here's a summary of our findings regarding MOS samples.
We have come to the conclusion that the MOS IT infrastructure is suitable for its purposes, so it is strong.
The user can handle this, so the IT infrastructure is solid, but there are problems with registration and payments between Member States.
As regards, for example, the analysis of the incidence reported in Synergy, in the Synergy database between Member States, but there are only a few 22 cases in five Member States.
Which we have examined, in which Member State the problem has already originated and is an affected Member State.
There were only twelve cases, so there were not so many cases, the problem is that the position of the Member States was really passive.
Only when the problems escalated, they started working on it, but the solution to the problems lasts a long time.
As far as the MOS is concerned, it takes long periods, but there are not many problems.
Also, in terms of technical error messages sent and received between Member States, the response is very passive, it is not proactive only when the problem escalates as an incident to which they begin to respond.
But this infrastructure for the MOS is robust.
We have assessed whether they are prepared for a single contact point.
We have received several complaints, especially from Austria.
They say they will not be prepared, not even from the Dutch path, which we have not analysed, because the system is mainly evolving on order by means of a single import contact point.
Registration problems are here.
We need to distinguish between a system outside the US and the EU system, and only 80% of registration applications have not been properly controlled.
As far as the well-known system outside the US is concerned, and we have found it, we have identified cases of double registration, which is something serious, and as far as payments are concerned, the problem is in particular with the lack of reminders in the Member State of consumption.
And sometimes by Member State of identification.
And problems with registration and withdrawal.
This is the most relevant cooperation between the administrative authorities, the exchange of information between the Member States we have visited.
And here we are comparing to the overall activity of the information chains, which we see, for example, there are overall information requirements that have been sent to a hundred eighty-two in comparison with overall information requirements.
They are generally not related to the ordinary nine thousand and two hundred, so not many of them will be more problematic in the UK, for example, three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is good, it is very low, and also some Member States have not changed, which is not why we recommend the separation of the CNO's centralised home office.
A separate structure designed for electronic trade or at least for MOS, so that the level of transmission of information is very weak.
Then we have multilateral checks, in two cases there were six cases of multilateral checks.
It was a really successful experience.
In two cases, however, this has not been successful at all because the Member State of identification refused to participate in the multilateral inspection.
This is something that should be resolved through the enforcement of new legislation, because now two Member States can request checks.
Another is the recent request that the second Member State of identification cannot refuse such participation.
So let us hope that it will improve, but there are other important things for Eurofisc.
There were four hundred and eighty signals, a chain through Eurofisc works for e-commerce full of five, and only one feedback related to these four hundred and eighty.
Therefore, the Member State did not consider this information very useful, they do not know why only five Member States were selected, they entered elderly people into the database.
And others didn't read it because they didn't think information was very useful.
There are therefore also several signals concerning trends or fraud topics, three or four topics which they consider useful.
And then there are changing web crawling tools, but that's something that some members are legally taking over in their country.
In other Member States, internal legislation prevents them from using web crawling tools.
The work file is now frozen and frozen activities are not useful.
They are waiting for a design of the information chain between the payment service provider.
Because they will, they'll be databases and they'll have access.
This is the Commission's proposal for all information provided by the payment service provider of any other country to the Commission's proposal.
Of course, we very much support and we are putting the proposal into the report, but I did not know until yesterday I asked that the Commission also needed some support on this proposal, because Lubik Lubis said there were problems.
However, in the Council, I took this as a matter of course, because this proposal comes from some kind of discussion at some forums with the Member States and the stakeholders.
Hopefully... this is very important, because another problem is the lack of controls, audits for the MOS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here that it's no one, because it's never how I can do it, if I don't, I don't know I don't have an analysis of data areas.
So my audit will be a random selection with perhaps a lot of information and no records, so they'll need some data, and these are the data.
In addition, the company will have much more applications.
Yeah, they seem to understand about Germany because we have data.
A team outside the U.S. but the information he may have at his disposal.
A phenomenon.
But I don't know further, there's virtually no control.
Also, checks on knowledge of distances within the EU have not been very successful.
Therefore, the customs office has the results of the sample from the courier and abuse of postal services.
In the post office, the main problem in addressing the question of underestimation is that you have very expensive drones declared below ten units or up to twenty-two euros.
Samples as such are thousand times as simple.
And they can read, and it's very difficult to do at the level of the post office.
And for a courier, they abuse the usual relief of 150 because they only check the takeover box and then 50 can't close.
A statement to stop the declaration, although a devaluation of more than one hundred and fifty, we are checking that not only in the sample, but also directly in the customized electronic system in the environment of the dam, where we have carried out several experiments.
Member States did not work in any Member State, it only worked in Austria.
But in Austria, he didn't get it.
We filed another alcoholic declaration.
And then for alcohol, it was promoted, and because this category is applicable to alcoholic products.
There are also some mistakes in the Austrian system.
This and the problem is therefore an approved economic operator abused by the system by the most reliable customers.
Furthermore, we have a recommendation recommending that the Commission use the structures provided in mutual assistance treaties with non-EU countries.
To solve these problems, find a lack of answers.
Also carry out inspections of Member States' inspections at local level for relief.
At least monitor the functioning of distance sales within the EU, mixed goods this recommendation is the only recommendation that the Commission has not accepted.
That's why they laughed yesterday, because your job is
Monitoring the committee and <CENSORED 22:25> said, "Yes, yes, yes."
I laughed, but fine.
They assist the Member State to develop a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for newcomers.
Because this is a problem, we can't know whether the system is working or not.
Most of the systems are expected to be successful, but it is usually a presumption, which is why we have an estimate of the largest VAT gap.
We do not know whether the system is successful, and we have no estimate for the European Union itself, so this would be very important.
Since the Commission is assisting Member States in their development, it is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative solutions.
There might be aid to tackle VAT fraud in the form of an alternative system for allocating payments.
Using blockchain technology, routes are designed, KPMG KPMG as well as Professor E. Ensworth's design.
There are very interesting proposals, which we have, of course, discussed with the Commission: the Commission says they are theoretical, they are practically reaching solutions.
In fact, they did not find practical application, Professor Lamas also made several suggestions on the use of technology for imports from outside the EU.
However, this system is accepted by many other countries.
There's no practical experience, but we think it's worth going deeper with blockchain technology offering opportunities.
This is something that is also examined by the Commission for the Management of a database of important mixed goods stores.
Numbers for the management of the validity of these numbers.
It is very important who is the future, the only way to deal with the use of the name of new technology for the Member States.
We, of course, like the fact that they are beginning to respond to fraudulent seniors and to regulate Eurofisc.
Also follow the compromise in line with the new EUR 10 000 threshold.
This is something that Czech colleagues pointed out in their report.
And we also took this into account for the reason they explained earlier.
In order to have a separate MOS and a remote coordination function for colleagues, we need to ensure that the trader can introduce a VAT rate, the correct VAT rate in the MOS VAT refunds.
Because when a trader introduces the wrong VAT rate, he receives only advice, but the declaration can be sent as well, so he receives advice, but will still be sent.
Also perform the necessary checks after receipt of registration in the MOS to avoid this problem of double registration.
Increase auditing activities for most MOS traders and remote sellers by means of tools of cooperation between administrations.
Staff of regular VAT estimates on electronic trading.
Therefore, if you were to be very grateful for this recommendation to the Member States, we would be very grateful if you remember the importance of following our recommendations in your home country.
That is why we are seeking your cooperation on this matter, and that's all we know if you have any questions.
