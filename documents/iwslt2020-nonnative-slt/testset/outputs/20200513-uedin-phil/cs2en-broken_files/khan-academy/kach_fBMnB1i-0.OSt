fill in the table with integers so
So you write 430 in five different ways.
Think about it a little bit.
We can see this 4 right over here as 4 hundreds.
So 4 hundred
And there's 3 in the place of the tens, so 3 tens.
That's 4 hundred and 3 tens.
But there's another way to write it.
for example, we can only have 3 hundreds
We took 100 from the place of hundreds and now
We can put it in a place for tens
If you take the 100 and put it in a place for tens.
100 is 10 tens.
Now you have 10 tens but before you had 3 tens
So you're going to have 13 tens here.
Maybe this seems a little confusing.
Don't forget it's 430
This is 300 plus 130
That's still 430
Similarly, you can also see it as 200 plus 230
230 is the same as 23 tens.
the same way it can be seen as 100 plus 330
Thirty-three tens are three hundred and thirty.
It can also be seen as 0 hundreds and 43 tens.
43 tens is 430
