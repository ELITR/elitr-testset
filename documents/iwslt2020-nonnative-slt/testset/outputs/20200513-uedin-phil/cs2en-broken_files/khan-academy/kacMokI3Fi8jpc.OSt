Shade 109
just for a repeat if we want to write 109
It would literally be 109 percent, which is the same thing.
Like 109 for, and now I could write a cent again.
But we already know that.
A cent means 100 literally so
means 109 out of 100
If we had 100 out of 100, we would have one whole.
But now we have more than a whole
We have 109 out of 100.
We could write this as a ratio or fraction.
It's the same thing as 109 divided by 100.
Same as 109 over 100.
So let's shade it out.
Here we have a whole we will
consider this square as a whole
In the last video, we were counting it.
It's a square of 10 to the 10th power.
is divided into 100 parts
We want to get 109 of these 100 parts.
What it's gonna look like
It means that we shadow all of them
100 parts right over here.
Let me do it in a new color.
So let's color this whole thing.
If we coloured just that, we would have 100
It would be 100 divided by 100 or 100 out of 100 or 100
I think you're starting to understand.
I don't want you to just memorize it.
It literally means 100 out of 100, or a whole.
So this is the whole square.
It's 100 out of 100 here.
The question is to color 109
We've already made 100 out of 100, but we still have to do another 9.
So let's color another nine.
So now we have 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9
This piece right over here.
That's exactly what it is.
It's nine whole squares.
This is 100 whole squares.
If we take this whole piece and add this blue piece to it
We get 109 one.
a whole square
I hope that makes sense.
