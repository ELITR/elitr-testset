London Interbank Offer Rate
To understand a little bit better, we've set up two banks here.
Bank a a a bank b and you may already know
That when you go and deposit your money in the bank
The bank won't keep all the money.
The way he makes money is that he lends a good portion of the money to other people as loans.
And they're just holding enough money in their hands
These things you know, people could actually come in and ask their money from their current account.
We've got enough in our hands
You can imagine that the bank is going to get into a situation where it has little cash.
or can reach close to the minimum reserve requirements
which the national central bank requires the bank to have
In these situations, let's say that the bank is getting into that situation.
They said let's go and borrow some money.
Let's go and borrow money from another bank.
This is interbank lending.
Bank b here is overwhelmed with cash
say we don't want to hold so much cash
We want to borrow it we can actually get interest on cash we don't get interest
For example, bank b lends money to the bank, and
Maybe he lends so much cash.
This is the new cash that the bank got, and
Here's the new cash.
And, of course, it's a loan.
This is a new loan to settle it. Remember.
that assets are equal to liabilities plus equity
The liabilities are all here
This is a loan from the bank b for this cash.
They have a little better reserve.
And now the bank b loan increased and their cash decreased
This is a loan to a bank, and
Here they took this cash and gave it to the bank, and
And the rate at which they borrowed it,
1 annual rate was needed
and of course it renews every day it's a day rate
This rate is an interbank rate
What are they doing on behalf of the British Banking Association?
They're doing surveys in a series of banks in London
8 12 16 banks in London
They said, look at what rate you're all trading at.
and will determine it,
determines this as a day-old libor rate
They identified it say 12 across all the banks from the survey
But what's interesting about the libra rate is that it's shown in ten currencies
It's not just in sterling dollars.
or yen is in ten currencies
That's what distinguishes her from other things.
But it really distinguishes her from the actual federal fund rate, which is another interbank lending rate.
But it's in the usa
and more subject to political pressures
The federal bank is actually trying to change it.
Hello. Hello.
