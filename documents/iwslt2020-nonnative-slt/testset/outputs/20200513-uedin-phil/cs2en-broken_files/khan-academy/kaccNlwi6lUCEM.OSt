we have the role of devon going to do 3 shelves for
my father
has a piece of board that is 12 metres long
He wants the top shelf to be half a foot shorter than
middle shelf
I'll do it in different colors.
So he wants the top shelf to be half a foot shorter than
middle shelf
I'll read the entire assignment first.
and the lower shelf should be half a foot shorter than twice the length
upper shelf
choose a different color
I'll do it in blue.
The bottom shelf will be half a foot shorter than twice the amount.
length of the upper shelf
How long will be the individual shelves if
consume an entire 12 metre board
Let's mark variables of different lengths of shelves
Because that's what we have to figure out.
We have the top shelf and the middle shelf
and lower shelf
So let's say that t is the length of the upper shelf.
t indicates the length of the top shelf
and m will correspond to the length of the middle shelf
m means the middle shelf
and b indicates the length of the lower shelf
b thus is the lower shelf
Now we'll find out what these different statements tell us.
So the first statement says devon wants to have the top shelf
I will use the same color wants to have the top
a shelf half a foot shorter than the middle shelf
So he wants the length of the top shelf to be
half a foot smaller than the length of the middle shelf
We have all the variables in meters so we can write
length of the middle shelf minus
12 metres
That's exactly what the orange underlined theorem tells us.
the upper shelf must be 12 metres shorter than the length
middle shelf
So what does another statement tell us?
and the lower shelf must be
12 metres shorter than
twice the length of the top shelf
So it's 12 meters smaller than twice that.
length of the upper shelf
These are both written statements.
using equations
the length of the upper shelf is equal to the length of the middle shelf
Negative 12
It's 12 meters shorter than the middle shelf.
and the lower shelf must be 12 metres shorter than
twice the length of the top shelf
So and how are we going to solve this?
well only with these two equations solve it
We can't but there's more information in the entrance
We have here indicated how long the individual shelves will be if
devon will use the whole 12 metres boards
So the length of all the shelves must
be a total of 12 metres
for production consumes everything
So t plus m plus b has to be 12 meters.
These are the lengths of each of the shelves
and she uses a total of 12 metres board
So the sum of the lengths of the boards must give 12 meters
So what can we do about it?
Well, we can express everything based on one variable.
We're going to express this according to m and then subtract them.
Dependence t on m we already have expressed
We can replace all t in equations
Relationship m minus 12
but here b depends on t
How can it be expressed depending on the m
Well, we know that t is equal to m minus 12.
replace all variables t
by this expression
This is t is equal to
We can rewrite the blue equation as the length of the bottom
the shelf is 2 times longer than the length of the top shelf
And we know that t is equal to m minus 12.
And if we simplify it a little bit, we get
the bottom shelf is equal to multiply it by two
2 times m is 2m.
2 times minus half is negative 1.
And all of that minus 12.
Or we could write it as b is equal to 2 times length.
middle shelf minus 32
That's right.
1 is 22 and minus 12 is
-32
So now we have all expressed by m and we can
put everything back
So the top shelf instead of having a t so
We're going to put m minus 12.
So we're going to put m minus 12 over here plus the middle length.
shelf plus length of lower shelf
So and we have already expressed it by means of m
That's what we just did.
here is written the length of the lower shelf depending on m
So instead of writing b here, we're writing 2m minus 32.
Plus 2m minus 32 and that's equal to 12.
All we did was replace t
We expressed t by m and we expressed b by m
Now let's add all the terms of m and the constants.
Here we have one m over here, another m over here, and
Then we have 2m over here.
and they are all positive
So 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4m.
So we have 4m.
and constant members
We have negative 12, and then we have negative 32.
So negative 12 minus 32 is negative 42, which is negative 42.
Negative 2
So we have 4m minus 2
And of course, this is still equal to 12.
On one side of the equation we want to have only
unknown m
So we're going to add to both sides plus 2 to get rid of the 2 to the
on the left side
So if we add 2 on both sides of this equation
So on the left-hand side will only remain 4m and these terms
They cancel out, and that's equal to 14.
Now we divide both sides by 4, and we get m is equal to
14 over 4, that's 72 meters because we're counting.
in meters
♪ Now we know ♪ ♪ But we're still missing ♪
What is t and b?
Let's do it.
Let's do t
t is equal to m minus 12.
So it's equal to our m is 72 minus 12 and that's going to be
Equal to 62 or 3 meters
we count in meters because we know that
It's in meters.
So the top shelf is 3 meters long
The middle shelf is 72 meters, which is the same thing as 3
and 12 metres
And the lower shelf is 2 times the top shelf
-12
And that's how much
That's 2 times 3 meters that's the length.
The top shelf minus 12 is equal to 6.
Negative 12 or 5 and 12 meters.
And we're done
And you can verify that the sum is actually 12
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 meters.
that equality is fulfilled
the top shelf is 12 meters shorter than the middle shelf
the lower shelf is 12 metres shorter than
twice the top shelf
And we're done
We already know the length of shelves that
devon needs to be made
