Let's do a few examples.
Let's see.
first example
What is 15 out of 40?
examples with percentages we solve by converting
percentage to the decimal that we then multiply
number from which we want to calculate percentages
So 15 expressed as a decimal is 0,15
I hope we've learned that in the video on converting percentage to decimal.
in the video, perhaps
And we just multiply it by 40.
So 40 times 0,15
5 times 0 is 0.
5 times 4 is 20.
move down
So let's write a zero.
And then 0 times 0 is 0.
1 times 4 is 4.
And we get six zero zero.
So let's write a decimal.
one, two
There's no decimal at the top, so one-two and one-two.
belongs here
So 15 out of 40 is equal to 0,15 times 40, which is equal to 6,0 hundreds.
That's the same thing as 6
Another example
I hope that doesn't confuse you too much.
Now I'll try to confuse you a little bit.
unless you are confused from the previous example
What is 0.2 percent of now to figure out the number of seven?
Many people tend to say
Oh zero, two tenths of a percent is the same thing as zero, two tenths of a percent.
If you see it the same way then it's a mistake
Because let's realize that it's not 0.2/10.
It's zero, two tenths of a percent.
There are two ways to think about it.
We could say that's 0.2 over 100 which is 0.2 over 100 which is 0.2 over 100.
If you multiply both the numerator and the denominator by ten
The same thing as two over a thousand.
or we use the technique when we move
decimal by two places to the left
So if we start with 0.2 and move
A decimal by two places to the left we get a hopla
Oh
hop hop
the decimal komma comes here
So it's 0.2 thousandth.
That's the key
0.2 tenth of percent is the same as 0.2 thousandths
It may tempt you to make this mistake myself I'm doing it out of discretion
But don't be sad if you ever do it
♪ But always keep your mind sharp ♪ ♪ When you see together ♪
decimal and percentage
Now that we've figured out how to write percentages
As a decimal, we have to multiply it by a number.
from which we calculate percentages
So 0.2 thousandths times 7.
It's pretty simple now.
7 times 2 is 14.
How many numbers do we have?
beyond the decimal
Let's count
One, two, three.
So we have to have three numbers behind the decimal.
So 0.2 percent of 7 is equal to 0.4 thousandths.
You're probably thinking it's
a really small number
And that's right because 0.2 percent if we think about it.
is even less than 1
i.e. less than one hundredth
And actually, when we think about it, 0.2 of a percentage is one fifth.
And if we count it, then one fifth of seven.
It's just going to be this number.
It's important to check it.
It's always good to do your exam because
when you work with decimals and percentages
is very easy to lose in decimal places
or make a multiple of ten
So always take the exam
Now I'll confuse you even more
What if I tell you what number is four twenty percent?
from which heading
Many may burst out
I'll take 20
Which is going to be 0.20ths.
And I'm going to multiply it four times.
And that would be a mistake
'Cause let's think
I said what 20 out of 4 is, no.
I said 20 out of some number is 4.
So let's just do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of an algebra.
I bet you didn't expect this in percentage examples.
Let's say x is a searched number.
And the assignment says 20 of x is equal to 4.
I think in this form, you already recognize it.
How do we write 20 decimals?
0.20 or 0.2 tenths
And we multiply it by x to get 4
20 is the same thing as 0.2/10.
It's the same thing as 0.20 but the last zero.
We don't need
0.2 times x is equal to 4.
And there's a simple linear equator
I bet you weren't expecting this.
What can I do with it?
Two views are possible
We can just divide both sides of this equation.
coefficient for x
So if we're dividing by 0.2 over here and 0.2 over here.
So it's going to be x is equal to 4 divided by 0.2
So let's say what 4 divided by 0.2 is.
Perhaps we'll have enough space.
0.2's goes into four, let's write a decimal here.
We're going to move the decimal here.
by one place to the right
We're going to get 2 and we're going to have to move the decimal here too.
by one place to the right
02 goes into 4 so many times
As 2 to 40
And that's easy
How many times does 2 go into 40?
2 is in four 2 times
And the zero goes into 2 zero times.
2 is in the age of 40 times 20 times
2 is in the age of forty-twenty times
So 4 divided by 0.2 is 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 out of 20.
And it makes sense
There's more ways to think about it.
20 is exactly one fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
That's right.
We can do the test for sure.
Let's figure out what 20 out of 20 is.
So 20 out of 20 is equal to 0,2 times 20.
And if we're going to count it, it's going to be 4 as well.
So we made sure that the result was correct.
Let's do another similar example.
selecting numbers randomly
So let's say 3 is 9 out of what?
Again, x is equal to the number of which 3 is 9.
You don't have to rewrite it like that.
So we know that 0.9 times 0.9 times 0.9 times x is the same thing.
As 9 of x is equal to 3.
So x is equal to 3 divided by 0.900.
We're dividing by a decimal.
So we're going to write a decimal.
and a few necessary zeros
We move the decimal by two places to the right.
We have to move it two seats over here, too.
009 goes into 3 so many times
As 9 to 300
9 goes into 30 three times.
3 times 9 is 27.
I think I'm seeing a pattern here.
Thirty-three 3 times nine is 27.
30 will be repeated
It's still going to be out 3
It comes out that 3 is 9 of you can also write.
333 periodical we also know that 03
It's actually one-third.
So 3 is 9 out of 33 and one third.
i that's an acceptable answer
often when we process with percentages
Looking only for approximate result
Accuracy is not so important here
But in this case, we'll be precise.
as well as in tests and there
where it is necessary
I hope it wasn't too fast and you've got a percentage from calculating
feeling good
in examples with percentages is required
Watch how they're written
if specified, find 10 out of 100
It's simple.
Just convert 10 to a decimal and multiply it by 100.
But if the input is 100 is 10 out of what?
It is important to realize that this is another example
What number is one hundred ten and if we calculate it
It'll be from a thousand.
Maybe I spoke fast enough when counting the percentage.
But I hope that doesn't confuse you.
I'll upload more examples
