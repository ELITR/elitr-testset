Welcome to talk about the Internet
Which is what you're using right now.
Internet is a large network of interconnected computers
and more than it was created in 2014
A billion websites
A whole billion
Until recently, it was only a million.
And it was a lot at the time
for what we use the site
initially used them
scientists to share their research
for example particle accelerator
But nowadays everyone uses them for almost anything
it is possible to write with your family via social media
share with other photos
Her cute kittens
travel portals can be planned for trips abroad
And those of the news,
Find out what's going on again
and then of course you need to use the site
khan academy for study
So what's your favorite page?
I actually have a slightly better question for you.
How should the page you miss on the Internet look?
perhaps a page about you
or something you like.
What's cool is that you can program this page yourself.
and you can learn it here at the khan academy
Think first about what you're going to want to create.
Because soon you'll learn how to do it
But let's start with the terminology.
What exactly the Internet is
Like I said, it's a lot.
connected computers to websites
when the computer is connected to the Internet and provides a website
We call it a server.
according to English serve to serve
The website is written in three languages
html creating a page structure
css then edits its appearance and javascript page makes interactive
how users see this page
we use an app to browse the Internet
for example chrome firefox or Internet explorer
these applications we call browsers
browsers all try to view the page in the same way
But they have some differences
That's why we sometimes say
hoda error occurred try using another browser
what browser are you using right now
you have to use the browser on some device
for example on your laptop mobile tablet or smart TV
all these devices we call clients
clients can be very different
Some are smaller than others
Some have touch screens others keyboard
Some are black and white
website trying to look good
on all different devices
and what device you use
And that's the Internet
i.e. its two-minute version
There's a lot more we can learn about him.
But I think it's time to start writing some html and css
and create your own website
