And you?
By the twenty-two.
Do you mind if I take my shoes off?
Those high heels are killing me!
Of course you do.
I don't mind.
Thank you. Thank you.
Why do you wear those high heels when you can wear sneakers?
I know a good shop that's focused on selling leisure shoes.
Oh, really?
Yes, I actually work for him.
His name is CaspoWalk Ltd. and we offer different types of shoes from different brands such as Nike, Adidas, for all ages and gender.
Do you also offer some special shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some pairs of shoes.
The special offer of this month is Danish-style woods, and if you like sport, you would like Nike's new shoes called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes you can control with your phone.
You can adjust your lace binding and the color of LEDs using the mobile application.
If I buy shoes at your place, will you offer me some accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer shoes and shoe inserts and many other accessories.
Here's my card.
You'll be sure to stop by our store.
All right, thank you.
You can find us in this building.
We're participating in the fair of student companies.
Thank you so much!
We got up to my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
Bye-bye.
Nice to meet you, too.
Bye-bye.
Good afternoon to everyone, my name is <NAME> and my name is <NAME>.
I would like to introduce you to SETA, which is an abbreviation: smartphones, electronics and technological accessories.
We're a company that sells electronic devices, such as printers, smartphones, and watches.
In addition, we are an international company communicating in French, English, Dutch and German.
We came here for the trade fair and we have prepared special offers for buyers.
One of the discounts relates to Instax.
When you buy this camera, you get a hundred free photo papers.
It is important to note that we also have quantitative discounts on orders over thirty products.
VAT is included in our prices.
Thank you for your time and I hope to see you at our stand, it's number sixty-three.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, my name is <NAME> and I'll show you today's company presentation in which I will present the most famous fictional company, directly from Austria, Total Regal.
Since 1999, we have ruled the market and destroyed other companies' dreams.
Our Executive Director was actually running this company before some of you were born.
Imagine it.
So where is our headquarters?
On the mountains, of course.
No, I'm joking, we really have other cities than Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirt and short leather trousers, no, I'm kidding.
But actually, it may happen that we pull traditional clothes out for one of the countless parties we're hosting when we want to have one beer or something.
Well, well, you're more like two beers.
So why should you buy our products?
The most popular of our products, which have already become real icons, by the way, we have been selling since 1999, or two decades.
For example Helping Hand, which is a great way to store all kinds of clothes, such as jackets, or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and purse.
So come see our store and, as we say in German, "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
So we would like to continue and kindly ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to deliver a presentation.
All right, here I am presenting our current state.
We have two national laws to make European regulation two directives.
One is about paper and digital publications.
Now they have the same rate.
And in certain circumstances, it's zero rate, but in other circumstances it's six percent.
In the case of rental of real estate, we accepted ... the possibility of rental of real estate ... and the compulsory VAT on short-term rental of real estate.
Then we did two audits.
One concerns ... which we have heard several times before, so I will be very brief about it.
The second concerns the registration treasury system.
And then we also have two new four trends.
Our audit on the MOS... is not yet completed and is not even published.
Therefore, all the conclusions and recommendations are only preliminary.
But we are almost certain that there will be no more major changes.
Hmmm.
Our conclusions are essentially identical to what we have heard here today.
But as far as we are concerned, I will just point out some things that are different, but which, in my view, are more or less specific to Belgium.
We currently have only a limited number of employees in the administration, because we are more or less a recipient, unlike MSID, which transfers money, and we depend considerably on other Member States.
But in the future, when the MOS is expanding most, more employees will be needed.
And they should now be trained and known in advance.
Another general conclusion that we have drawn, but which has also been said here, is that there have been changes in the control strategies.
What has to happen is a new direction of thinking.
But our administration strongly believes in another MSID, because if we look at conclusions like MSCON...
Just skip from one to the other.
So we see that there is a very poor control strategy.
We therefore strongly believe that every MSID will send or transfer money.
It's up to us.
Nevertheless, we have highlighted the importance of making progress in the field of control strategy by creating risk profiles.
Our administration has not yet been able to create good risk profiles because they don't have enough data, but they think they will in the future.
I have more data in the future and I could create certain risk profiles, so that in the future we will be monitoring whether the control policy will improve.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We are following other taxpayers on the Internet, so there is a system to find taxpayers on the Internet.
But for now, the results are rather bad.
There is not much about taxpayers that can be traced.
Then we see that...
The MSIDD registration procedure is fine as such, but in the circumstances where taxpayers are cancelled...
There are no follow-up measures if they submit a declaration in the ordinary system.
There is therefore no link or any subsequent system, which we think is important.
Then we have... in the confession process.
There are some automatic checks, which we find very interesting.
So this is not a real check of completeness and correctness (yes, thank you) of completeness and correctness.
But it still helps when there are common mistakes.
Therefore, the actual checks must be carried out by the MSCON, but as a MSID, but Belgium is still helping to fill in the declarations, so there are certain errors.
There will be a warning in the system, or if you have to make a selection and all options will be limited, just click on possible options, so there will be fewer errors.
As a MSCON, we also found that they worked in Benelux.
So, together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they have created a matrix of certain risks and are developing new control activities.
As a function of these risks and there are already two test sets that have begun so far.
We therefore recommend that we continue to work in this small group in order to make progress and expand knowledge to European forums.
I think it's the differences that we've had, unlike what we haven't heard before.
So we're going to do a second audit.
An audit of the registration boxes system has been carried out.
This is not an audit carried out by Luden and me, but carried out by other members of the audit cell.
It was also an audit that was slightly wider than VT, but I will only present conclusions and recommendations that are important for VT.
The audit focused on the effectiveness and effectiveness of the audit policy.
Installation and application, so they looked at two problems related to the registration boxes system.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations they have reached are that the regulation is too complex.
They therefore recommend simplification because there are too many derogations in the regulation in the national regulation.
That it was very difficult to establish a particular group only on the basis of the statement itself.
Therefore, it was very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that had to install the registration boxes system.
Another major conclusion was control policy.
There are problems with the collection of taxpayers by the taxpayers' registration treasury system.
If there was a limit, there's a limit, and if the confession is too low, then you fall below that limit, and there's no control here, so this was the way to escape the legislation.
There was also a problem with cross-checks of information data from databases for the selection of taxpayers for their control.
Another conclusion was that there were poor internal controls for the application of the system.
As regards the fines that were imposed, they found that different control units had imposed different fines.
There were therefore no rules on fines, but some were very strict and other control teams were not strict at all, or they had fines much lower than the rates that they paid for certain mistakes, also risk analysis and online access.
It would be an advantage, but it's not being implemented now, so the risk analysis was very simple and there's no online access, but once we learned that this type of system exists in other countries when they have online access.
They found that this could be a very good advantage.
Then there was also an exchange of information with the national social security office, which was not very good.
So a lot of information didn't get from one to the other.
Finally, about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with loading transactions
The system as such works very well when it is used when it is used, as if it was supposed to be used, but when certain transactions were not entered into the system, they could not be discovered.
So the solution could be to create a media campaign so that customers can request a ticket.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise, it will not be a ticket or that legislation would be adapted to the fact that only electronic payments would be accepted, because then it would be easier to track money.
But there is no reliable measurement of impact management as a real impact, so they have no idea.
Our team then performed several tests and tried to find an impact, but they discovered that there was an effect of expectation because the implementation of the system was postponed by several years.
However, everyone knew that this was coming, so customers and companies were already expecting legislation that was about to change and introduce this system.
The exact differences between VAT revenue before 2016, when the system was introduced and then, were therefore very difficult to trace.
Since already a few years before 2016, VAT returns were increasing with regard to a new system that would be subject to amendments.
Our team wasn't sure about the effect.
It's just about this system or the fact that the effect was even greater because it started sooner than they thought.
Look, I can interrupt you, just, I have a problem, or I'd like to understand it right.
What am I supposed to imagine as a system of registration treasures?
Does that mean that this treasury system is registered somewhere in the database?
No, it's not, it's online, it's cash cash, yeah "cash".
Oh, okay, so it's just for cafes, hotels and restaurants.
It's only for a particular sector.
So far, it is only in the Horeca sector and it is a system that registers every transaction or should register every projection that is inserted into the system.
(So) There is no online access.
That is why the selection of the control group is so important, because the control teams have to go to different places.
They can't focus on it online on the computer, they have to go to HoReCa and connect their computer to the cashier.
To get the data out of it and check it out.
Yes, but they can't do it from a distance.
They must always reach the establishment on their own.
So that's why the confession is too low and below the limit.
Teams won't go there to see if they know the cafe, for example, and they know that there are lots of customers and they're not there, but that's just a coincidence.
But that's something they found out later, so it's gonna be them.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was afraid that I was the only one who didn't understand.
All right, but what's the difference between this system, which you're talking about at any dealer's registration office, I mean in the food?
So what's so strange about this particular system that you're there.
There's a special software that offers any possibility of fraud with the system and it's also a software that ensures that the data can be transferred to the computer of the control teams.
While you can't extract data in the same way in the ordinary system of registration boxes.
So these are the registration treasury systems they have.
Yes, they are also special, but I think there are five different stamps of registration treasury systems, from which you can choose and have a certification.
That all data that can be extracted in data formats are suitable for analysis by the control teams.
Yeah, yes, so compatibility is certified, which is the main part of the domain of the different sections.
Yes, you have mentioned this risk analysis that risk services analysis is missing or have not all been carried out or.
I mean online access to this analysis or?
Online access to your own registration treasury system.
Okay, so which checks could be much easier, well, and because we can do automatic checks or extract data.
Which could be inserted into a larger system and the risk analysis was actually very basic because they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or this system was only introduced in 2016, so they had only two years of data at their disposal.
Okay, to conclude.
I have two new fraudulent trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called Matrimony, which consisted of registering a large number of foreign companies.
But always the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulgarian.
But they registered to names that were very similar to known names.
There was only a difference in one letter, just to make it plausible to assume that these companies existed, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they only lodged a VAT statement and requested VAT refund with false invoices, but they always made this statement in writing and for very small amounts.
Which means the administration had to put all the information into the system, which took time.
Therefore, some reimbursements have already been made before they could actually find out that there was a possibility of fraud and they could check whether the company actually existed and whether those invoices were real.
However, this type of fraud has been discovered and information about it has already been spread through the Eurofisc, so I think that any tax administration is already informed of this type of fraud.
Another fraud consisted of green energy certificates, which were very similar to previous CO3-2 certificates.
The fraudulent plan was more or less the same as sending invoices.
Or they used invoices of a company that was very similar to a law firm that was supposed to send invoices.
So we had a fraud plan, and I shortened it a lot, and I don't have a picture of it.
But let me explain it this way.
There was a company A in a Member State X, which, according to certificates from B in another Member State A, sold these certificates to C.
Again another Member State Z and sent to this company an invoice from the corresponding A with a comma...
So that's the name of the company that only differs in one letter from the original.
So, company C would not see that there is actually a fraud.
And of course, A and A were the same managers that have this company A, and A with the point would be the missing trader.
I hope this type of fraud is clear.
And that was the end of my presentation.
Well, if you'll excuse me.
I would like to ask our Polish colleagues to give their presentation.
Thank you. Thank you.
And to refresh my memory, I would like to say a few words about the new regulations and the new instruments that were introduced last year and this year.
We introduced you to some of these at our last plenary session in Warsaw.
So those of you who were in Warsaw should know something about this.
So I would briefly remind you of some of them, and then I will tell you about our previous audit in this area and our conclusions.
First of all, I would like to mention the single audit package.
We started introducing these instruments three years ago.
Last year, however, the final phase took place, because the first phase was that the single audit package had to be mandatory on request submitted to the tax authorities.
And now it's an automatic system.
The information shall be submitted electronically without any request.
And since July 1 last year
This is mandatory for all types of operators.
Since 2016.
it was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, smaller and now for all businesses.
I will also come back to that, because we consider it crucial in the fight against VAT reductions.
The second legislation I would like to mention is the so-called ‘fuel package’ and, in this case, the regulation has been introduced gradually.
It depends on the type of undertaking and its main idea is that fuel trading licences are granted only to companies having their headquarters in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign companies are registered for VAT in their own countries, the same types of companies can benefit from their practices of suspension of excise duty, which respect the intra-Community purchase of fuel, and VAT resulting from the intra-Community purchase of fuel will have to be paid immediately after the goods have been dispatched to Poland or after
Another regulation is the transport package.
It must be said that the draft law is based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this type has been introduced in Hungary and in Poland we have introduced this system of monitoring goods transport only for certain categories of goods.
In general, they are goods on which excise duty is levied.
I am referring to fuel, tobacco and some others, and I am referring to monitoring how these goods are transported by road or rail.
This means that each individual transport must be reported before the start of the transport, in a separate system, a dedicated system and, since last year, each transport has been connected to the geolocation system.
So for each individual truck, you can determine where it is right now.
Roads, parking, etc.
And the Minister of Finance for the Ministry of Finance, which analyzes the entire system of large data that has been delivered online, some of the public institutions, and as we know, there may be a lot of results, and there may be some inconsistencies in many, and many could find a business entity that provides them with this transport in a way that is abnormal in terms of routes, time, etc.
And this year, we're planning to carry out an audit of the Treasury.
How the Treasury is prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is in place in the sense that all these companies must register all transport and the system is prepared in the sense of an analysis that is carried out online.
However, we do not know yet whether the Minister of Finance will use this information for any action taken by the tax authorities.
Another legislation is to some extent similar to that presented yesterday by our colleague, who specializes in technical issues.
So we have a certain black list, but in Poland, the term black list means the list of entities that have been removed from the VAT record.
And we have an information-based system, again given online banks and other financial system entities.
This system may be used by the Treasury Minister to identify possible irregularities and problems, and it aims to capture unusual transactions and provide information on them online to the tax authorities.
And on the basis of this information, the tax office can block an account, a bank account, and a specific transaction.
What is the risk of enforcement of a higher fine than, let's say, EUR 10,000.
Another legislation is the distribution of payments that was introduced last year.
At the moment, it's optional.
But actually, it depends on the buyer.
If one contracting party uses it, then the method of payment for the supplier, of course, is mandatory.
What is important is that if this payment allocation mechanism is applied, the joint and solidary liability of the taxpayer is excluded.
I'll show you some numbers, and I'll tell you in a little bit about how this distribution can be used in the payment mechanism.
Finally, there is one legislative and organisational instrument that was presented in quite detail last year by our colleague from the Ministry of Finance.
Therefore, we have a new national income administration, based on previous free administration, and now we have another administration that is fighting tax and customs administration in one system.
Plus the online registration system
Ha ha ha.
At the moment, we have a compulsory type of registration box system and the compulsory element of these registration boxes is electronic memory.
The tax office is therefore able to verify authorized types of registration boxes on the basis of memory, but we are starting with an online registration system only for certain sectors.
These are first and foremost legal services, medical services, only certain specific sectors.
This implies that we need to start working on the creation of a central system led by the head of the national income management.
In this system, all these transactions should be registered immediately and simply online.
That is why we are starting this debate so that we can introduce possible distribution of payments to all taxpayers affected.
In fact, this means that we would like the tax authorities to wish to replace the reverse tax liability by this mechanism of allocation of payments and reverse tax liability and joint and solidary responsibility.
Thus, in all sectors where transferred tax liability or joint and indivisible liability is binding, all of these sectors could be subject to this payment allocation mechanism.
Now, as I have already mentioned, I will tell you about our audit.
We audited last year.
The period during which the audit was carried out was relatively long - it was twelve years, and that is why we were asked by the Committee on Public Finance of the same Polish Chamber of Parliament to carry out such an audit.
We have reached the following conclusions.
We had to say that the effectiveness of the work of the Ministry of Finance was very fluctuating over this long period.
In our view, between 2010 and 2015, the Ministry and the tax authorities have made somewhat poor efforts to improve their VAT revenue efficiency.
Since the audit was carried out by the Ministry of Finance on the supervision of tax revenue or the collection of taxes, namely the collection of VAT, this was reflected here.
One of the signs of this volatility in the efficiency of work is
so-called VAT GAP.
And during those years, the VAT GAP in Poland was on average 24 percent, which was about ten points more than the median of the EU countries.
Among other things, we have concluded that the supervision has not been effectively contacted.
So that's how it is.
We can say that we have information about VAT GAP in Poland and EU countries and that we have figures from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And, as you can see, the average difference between the VAT GAP in Europe is certainly lower than in Poland; although we do not take into account the source of information, the figures are quite clear.
Mmmm.
I have already mentioned that our main instrument and main instrument for the tax authorities, as well as the idea that has been put into practice during this period, was the single audit package, and over the last two years the tax authorities have acquired competences to use databases to analyse them.
For example, in 2017, four million invoices were automatically analysed, but only 3,300 warnings were issued on the basis of these analyses.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed did not increase much - it was about five million, but the analysis brought more than 350,000 warnings.
This has been reflected in receipts because the first stage is automatic analysis and then comes a warning sent via SMS or e-mail.
So without any administrative proceedings in tax proceedings, etc.
And this system, or its first phase, the automatic phase, has brought us additional revenue, VAT revenue worth more than EUR 150 million a year.
I am talking about the figures for 2017 and 2018.
It should be noted that income increased in good economic conditions and improved VAT collection as a result of the extensive package of legislative and organisational changes introduced in recent years.
Nevertheless, we believe that one of the main sources of these results, these financial results, is precisely the introduction of this single audit package.
As a result of another instrument, this mechanism for allocation of payments in 2018 followed the application of the allocation mechanism, which, as I mentioned earlier, was optional.
However, we observe an increased interest in making payments in this way.
In July last year, the taxpayers carried out 600,000 transactions.
In December, more than one and a half million transactions were made through the allocated payment mechanism.
The value of the tax paid under this allocated payment mechanism in July was half a billion euro.
And half a billion euros on 1 December.
Overall, for the period from July to December last year, the taxpayers carried out more than seven million transactions through the payment allocation mechanism and the amount of tax in the VAT special accounts reached around six billion euro.
And one more information about the work of the tax authorities, last year, the tax authorities and the Ministry carried out 30 percent fewer checks than in 2017, but with fewer checks, the percentage of checks that were detected in irregularities increased.
In our view, this is the result of the new electronic tools introduced, which have helped to better select the entities to be checked.
It is clear that the reduction in the number of checks has been achieved by the reduction in the number of checks being accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is obviously less painful and time-consuming for taxpayers.
This led to an increase in the findings by 100 percent last year compared to 2017.
So in general, we believe that several legislative instruments have been introduced over the past few years.
In summary, the results are thus sufficient.
However, we must not forget that this has been done in economically favourable conditions.
So it's impossible to determine exactly what part of these income increases were caused by which factor.
If this is the result of new organisational and legislative instruments
or whether it is the overall economic situation.
That's all.
Thank you. Thank you.
If you have any questions, please ask.
Do you have any more questions?
If not, I would like to ask our Romanian colleagues to speak.
All right, hello.
Do you all hear me right?
Yes? Yes?
So we have been introducing 19 percent of VAT in Romania for two years now.
And although plans to reduce to 18 percent have emerged, they have been postponed for now.
In addition, we have two reduced VAT rates, nine percent and five percent.
There have been several changes in the past year in terms of products which may have a reduced rate.
So the biggest change in the sewer service, where the rate has been reduced from nineteen percent to nine percent since January 1st of this year.
Other items remain unchanged.
On the other hand, there have been a lot of changes in the 5% rate, especially in some products that were at nine percent, and now they have been converted to five percent.
The biggest change has occurred last 1 June this year; it concerns high-quality food and mountain products, as well as traditional products.
And for products manufactured on the mountains, cows or sheep that produce them have to live there at least half of their lives.
The manufacturer has to get them an authorisation, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
Then he will be able to apply a reduced rate.
Then we have a transferred tax liability mechanism.
In Romania, both companies must be registered in order to be able to use this system.
There are fourteen products for which this can be shortened, and in December two thousand eighteen had to be extended to twenty-two for some of them.
Finally, the value added tax distribution system that was introduced in two thousand seventeen, although it now seems that the Treasury has somewhat forgotten about it.
In the year two thousand seventeen it started with more than four hundred companies and now in the year two thousand nineteen their number fell to forty-six percent.
Moreover, in the year two thousand eighteen, no new companies started to use this system.
So all the companies that started it have since then begun to return from this system to the normal VAT system.
Moreover, the European Commission has ordered Romania to cease using this system.
It seems, therefore, that the system has not fulfilled what was expected of it, so the Ministry is likely to cease to use it fully.
Completely?
I am based on the data that we have at our disposal because in the year two thousand eighteen, or in the year two thousand nineteen, no new companies were registered.
So there are only companies in the system that started in two thousand seventeen, and their number is slowly declining.
As regards all these findings, there are still certain regulatory gaps with regard to the MOSS system, which, for some reason, is referred to in Romania as M1SS because it has been translated.
But that's just how it is.
In addition, we lack IT systems at the tax offices that can work together and exchange data.
This will not make the situation easier for companies, and last year we finally introduced an electronic system like that in Belgium.
They have introduced electronic registration treasures and companies are now obliged to start using them, so the tax authorities check that all companies have them installed.
However, we are not yet sure that the system is fully operational due to the limits in the IT system of the tax authorities.
And so far, no new trends have been detected.
So, that's all.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, so we did this audit.
The audit report will be published on 16 July.
That's why you keep this information secret.
They are subject to an information embargo until the date of publication.
We are waiting for a Commission response in all 23 official EU languages.
Because we only have an answer in English, so it's just a formality and the audit is now over.
The title was ‘Many challenges...’ and the special report will be ‘Many challenges remain to be addressed in collecting VAT on customs duties’.
There's a solution left.
Originally, it was supposed to be ‘It would need to be addressed’, but some have already been addressed to some extent through new legislation, a new Commission proposal, which has just been mentioned by <CENSORED>.
However, there are still problems that remain to be solved, so we will see later.
So I'll start with why we chose this subject of audit.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
And we will conclude with our recommendations.
First of all, okay, we did a survey because we follow up on previous research analyses.
Based on the findings of the head of these institutions in the field of e-commerce, German colleagues, Lithuanian colleagues, carried out audits.
In the previous decision on imports, we also analyze the issue of distance from non-EU countries and the related VAT and customs issues, and we decided that it was worth going deeper during this audit.
The problem is that honest traders are often excluded from the market by dishonest traders and are no longer able to compete.
This is a problem raised by representatives of the academic community, such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and is particularly intense in the United Kingdom.
Also estimates of losses.
There are only estimates of distances from non-EU countries.
But these estimates are not very encouraging, because, although the committee estimates only five billion per year, it is between £1 billion and £1.5 billion per year in the United Kingdom.
This is how they estimated the losses.
This represents a reduction of 8 to 10 % in VAT in the United Kingdom.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently represents only four percent.
So the triple of the fight against fraud in the United Kingdom represents the amount of losses in e-commerce in goods purchased from third countries.
This is a mission.
We are not counting distance sales within the EU here, we are not counting most electronic services here.
So the basis is to highlight our concerns.
Then what we are focusing on is visiting five Member States - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why have we taken into account the number of registrations for the MOS system, both in programmes outside the EU and in the US.
Also, the volume of electronic sales within the EU and finally the estimated amount of VAT lost as a result of the VAT exemption on imports of goods of minor value (LVCR).
Following a study of our source in the committee, we also visited the committee.
These steps should discourage technology and the World Customs Organisation and the cancelled period lasted from 2015 to the end of 2018.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal tabled and all the proposals that will enter into force in 2021.
What are we focusing on?
Of course, we started analysing the answers to our survey, the survey sent by the main group two.
We are continuing the questionnaire in all the Member States we have visited to interviews with all kinds of people.
We have obtained access, and what is also very important, we have set up access to ABC data to the Synergia database, i.e. the incident database, the problems that Member States report in the MOS system.
We have access to all project groups fiscali (fiscal) and electronic groups related to e-commerce, and to all project groups related to the BUT, where there is plenty of information and discussion about the functioning of the MOS system.
And, of course, we got funding from the support of institutions from Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and finally we made our own samples of various transactions.
Overall, we collected nearly nine hundred transactions related to e-commerce.
What we find, of course, was first positive things, and then we will continue with the most negative ones.
The regulatory framework is governed by the best international practices of the OECD and the World Customs Organisation’s extremes.
In most aspects relating to the OECD, the principle of taxation at destination has been observed in most cases, except in this principle.
There is now a new threshold below EUR 10,000 that you can apply in the Member State of origin, so this is not in line with the OECD.
In the case of the World Customs Organisation, which deals with imported packages, the guidelines for immediate release have been followed in most respects, as well as a new proposal within the framework of standards.
The Commission is a pioneer in this area and, in most respects, is adapting to the World Customs Organisation and standards.
As regards the new provision, which will enter into force in 2021...
I am trying to solve some weaknesses, but for us, the main problem that will continue to arise is underestimation.
The loss of VAT and customs duties is and will continue.
This cannot be addressed by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As far as trade with countries outside the EU is concerned, this will not be solved, and later we will also see why.
Why is it, because the cooperation agreements between administrative authorities and third countries are not working.
We have a new deal with Norway.
We expect a change of information with Norway that this will work, but that is no problem.
It's not Norway, it's China, it's the United States of America.
The information chain does not work with China because the Chinese counterpart does not respond and the response rate is falling and falling, so that is the problem.
If we have information about changing supplier who does not work using an electronic interface, i.e. he works directly on his website, who has not registered in the MOS or even registered and after we cancel registration, he opens a new website...
So why are we paying VAT from Europe to China and expecting VAT to return to the EU?
Unless we also have administrative cooperation.
That's never gonna happen.
This is a problem among the EU countries, it does not work as expected.
Administrative cooperation also, so we will see later that the controls carried out by the national tax authorities are weak.
Because there are virtually no tools to carry out a proper analysis of the risk of accident, which has already been mentioned.
It will therefore be necessary for a Member State to approve the Commission's proposal to amend the information, with insufficient payment service providers subject to the Commission's control.
And we'll see later, of course, the committee did not perform any monitoring, no monitoring.
There are weaknesses in their own electronic check-in systems.
The traditional problem, of course, is that traders underestimated goods in order to remain below the euro threshold for twenty-two or ten years of VAT.
And this will disappear in the future, but they will continue to underestimate to pay lower VAT.
This will not be approved, but they will pay less, and as far as customs duties are concerned, the assumption is set at EUR 150 and they cannot handle it.
Because in all electronics... we'll see the EU electronic clearing system later, they can't stop the declaration.
Because they check the box they own an electronic... which they apply to the customer electronically for relief.
And they promoted the system, even though they declared a value that was above a hundred and fifty.
The electronic system cannot stop this, they said it was something very serious, because the operators that work there are promising economic operators.
So, big couriers have the authority of an association of economic operators, and they say they're the most reliable, but they're abusing of this system.
Enforcement of VAT customs duties is not effective.
Okay, provisions on a chain of information on recovery claims related to this tax.
They have rarely been used, from the five Member States we have visited, only in Austria.
Only in five cases, so it's not often used.
We are analysing the inconsistencies of payments between Member States.
We have access to the harmonisation carried out by the Commission and there are still overlooked combinations.
It means a lot between Member States.
Of course, the problem in the Netherlands is that they are unable to harmonise, which explains the amounts of VAT received with the VAT declaration.
And there are also problems with the reminders that our colleagues at the NKU yesterday...
They assumed a problem with the comments of the Member States on consumption that are not ...
Here's a summary of our findings regarding MOS samples.
We have come to the conclusion that the MOS IT infrastructure is suitable for its purposes, so it is strong.
The user can handle this, so the IT infrastructure is solid, but there are problems with registration and payments between Member States.
As regards, for example, the analysis of the incidence reported in Synergy, in the Synergy database between Member States, but there are only a few 22 cases in five Member States.
Which we have examined, in which Member State the problem has already originated and is an affected Member State.
There were only twelve cases, so there were not so many cases, the problem is that the position of the Member States was really passive.
Only when the problems escalated, they started working on it, but the solution to the problems lasts a long time.
As far as the MOS is concerned, it takes long periods, but there are not many problems.
Also, in terms of technical error messages sent and received between Member States, the response is very passive, it is not proactive only when the problem escalates as an incident to which they begin to respond.
But this infrastructure for the MOS is robust.
We have assessed whether they are prepared for a single contact point.
We have received several complaints, especially from Austria.
They say they will not be prepared, not even from the Dutch path, which we have not analysed, because the system is mainly evolving on order by means of a single import contact point.
Registration problems are here.
We need to distinguish between a system outside the US and the EU system, and only 80% of registration applications have not been properly controlled.
As far as the well-known system outside the US is concerned, and we have found it, we have identified cases of double registration, which is something serious, and as far as payments are concerned, the problem is in particular with the lack of reminders in the Member State of consumption.
And sometimes by Member State of identification.
And problems with registration and withdrawal.
This is the most relevant cooperation between the administrative authorities, the exchange of information between the Member States we have visited.
And here we are comparing to the overall activity of the information chains, which we see, for example, there are overall information requirements that have been sent to a hundred eighty-two in comparison with overall information requirements.
They are generally not related to the ordinary nine thousand and two hundred, so not many of them will be more problematic in the UK, for example, three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is good, it is very low, and also some Member States have not changed, which is not why we recommend the separation of the CNO's centralised home office.
A separate structure designed for electronic trade or at least for MOS, so that the level of transmission of information is very weak.
Then we have multilateral checks, in two cases there were six cases of multilateral checks.
It was a really successful experience.
In two cases, however, this has not been successful at all because the Member State of identification refused to participate in the multilateral inspection.
This is something that should be resolved through the enforcement of new legislation, because now two Member States can request checks.
Another is the recent request that the second Member State of identification cannot refuse such participation.
So let us hope that it will improve, but there are other important things for Eurofisc.
There were four hundred and eighty signals, a chain through Eurofisc works for e-commerce full of five, and only one feedback related to these four hundred and eighty.
Therefore, the Member State did not consider this information very useful, they do not know why only five Member States were selected, they entered elderly people into the database.
And others didn't read it because they didn't think information was very useful.
There are therefore also several signals concerning trends or fraud topics, three or four topics which they consider useful.
And then there are changing web crawling tools, but that's something that some members are legally taking over in their country.
In other Member States, internal legislation prevents them from using web crawling tools.
The work file is now frozen and frozen activities are not useful.
They are waiting for a design of the information chain between the payment service provider.
Because they will, they'll be databases and they'll have access.
This is the Commission's proposal for all information provided by the payment service provider of any other country to the Commission's proposal.
Of course, we very much support and we are putting the proposal into the report, but I did not know until yesterday I asked that the Commission also needed some support on this proposal, because Lubik Lubis said there were problems.
However, in the Council, I took this as a matter of course, because this proposal comes from some kind of discussion at some forums with the Member States and the stakeholders.
Hopefully... this is very important, because another problem is the lack of controls, audits for the MOS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here that it's no one, because it's never how I can do it, if I don't, I don't know I don't have an analysis of data areas.
So my audit will be a random selection with perhaps a lot of information and no records, so they'll need some data, and these are the data.
In addition, the company will have much more applications.
Yeah, they seem to understand about Germany because we have data.
A team outside the U.S. but the information he may have at his disposal.
A phenomenon.
But I don't know further, there's virtually no control.
Also, checks on knowledge of distances within the EU have not been very successful.
Therefore, the customs office has the results of the sample from the courier and abuse of postal services.
In the post office, the main problem in addressing the question of underestimation is that you have very expensive drones declared below ten units or up to twenty-two euros.
Samples as such are thousand times as simple.
And they can read, and it's very difficult to do at the level of the post office.
And for a courier, they abuse the usual relief of 150 because they only check the takeover box and then 50 can't close.
A statement to stop the declaration, although a devaluation of more than one hundred and fifty, we are checking that not only in the sample, but also directly in the customized electronic system in the environment of the dam, where we have carried out several experiments.
Member States did not work in any Member State, it only worked in Austria.
But in Austria, he didn't get it.
We filed another alcoholic declaration.
And then for alcohol, it was promoted, and because this category is applicable to alcoholic products.
There are also some mistakes in the Austrian system.
This and the problem is therefore an approved economic operator abused by the system by the most reliable customers.
Furthermore, we have a recommendation recommending that the Commission use the structures provided in mutual assistance treaties with non-EU countries.
To solve these problems, find a lack of answers.
Also carry out inspections of Member States' inspections at local level for relief.
At least monitor the functioning of distance sales within the EU, mixed goods this recommendation is the only recommendation that the Commission has not accepted.
That's why they laughed yesterday, because your job is
Monitoring the committee and <CENSORED 22:25> said, "Yes, yes, yes."
I laughed, but fine.
They assist the Member State to develop a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for newcomers.
Because this is a problem, we can't know whether the system is working or not.
Most of the systems are expected to be successful, but it is usually a presumption, which is why we have an estimate of the largest VAT gap.
We do not know whether the system is successful, and we have no estimate for the European Union itself, so this would be very important.
Since the Commission is assisting Member States in their development, it is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative solutions.
There might be aid to tackle VAT fraud in the form of an alternative system for allocating payments.
Using blockchain technology, routes are designed, KPMG KPMG as well as Professor E. Ensworth's design.
There are very interesting proposals, which we have, of course, discussed with the Commission: the Commission says they are theoretical, they are practically reaching solutions.
In fact, they did not find practical application, Professor Lamas also made several suggestions on the use of technology for imports from outside the EU.
However, this system is accepted by many other countries.
There's no practical experience, but we think it's worth going deeper with blockchain technology offering opportunities.
This is something that is also examined by the Commission for the Management of a database of important mixed goods stores.
Numbers for the management of the validity of these numbers.
It is very important who is the future, the only way to deal with the use of the name of new technology for the Member States.
We, of course, like the fact that they are beginning to respond to fraudulent seniors and to regulate Eurofisc.
Also follow the compromise in line with the new EUR 10 000 threshold.
This is something that Czech colleagues pointed out in their report.
And we also took this into account for the reason they explained earlier.
In order to have a separate MOS and a remote coordination function for colleagues, we need to ensure that the trader can introduce a VAT rate, the correct VAT rate in the MOS VAT refunds.
Because when a trader introduces the wrong VAT rate, he receives only advice, but the declaration can be sent as well, so he receives advice, but will still be sent.
Also perform the necessary checks after receipt of registration in the MOS to avoid this problem of double registration.
Increase auditing activities for most MOS traders and remote sellers by means of tools of cooperation between administrations.
Staff of regular VAT estimates on electronic trading.
Therefore, if you were to be very grateful for this recommendation to the Member States, we would be very grateful if you remember the importance of following our recommendations in your home country.
That is why we are seeking your cooperation on this matter, and that's all we know if you have any questions.
I am now giving the floor to Mr Mayrbeurle.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
It is a great honor for me to be able to speak here.
I will try to introduce you here briefly to our instrument for large amounts of data, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
So before I really start, I would like to inform you about the situation in the largest municipalities of Austria.
These are municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants and since two thousand eleven we have been entitled to control all these local authorities.
Before that, the threshold was 20,000.
Thus, gray points represent more than twenty thousand inhabitants and blue less than twenty thousand.
The explanation is still in German.
I'm sorry about that.
We are therefore entitled to carry out an audit of seventy-five municipalities in total.
This represents about 3.2 percent of the total municipalities
However, we provide advice to all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, we in our department decided to develop a special tool that we call the Instrument for the Monitoring of Municipalities.
The development team consists of three young economists who work in our department. I am one of them.
We all three use this tool for different purposes.
So what was the objective of this instrument, why was it even created?
The main reason was the effort to find an analytical tool for evaluating financial risk.
So first we try to design a profile for each village.
Taking into account all relevant factors.
In the second step, we assess the municipalities in view of their importance for the auditing activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we classify municipalities according to financial risk on the basis of certain indicators.
The order is always interesting, it is the most interesting of all of this, because it gives us the opportunity to compare all the villages.
Thank you. Thank you.
The hardest task of each database project is to collect quality data.
We heard about it a day earlier.
In this context, we must mention that the statistics of Austria, which is an Austrian statistical agency, are very helpful for us, and that agency is our most important partner in this project.
We got the following data from them.
These data are actually available to every citizen.
But if you want aggregate data, you have to buy it from the Statistics of Austria.
And only aggregated data are useful for analysis.
So we have cross-sectional accounts of budgets and accounting regulations.
We have detailed information about closed accounts, so we have accounts at the level of free tickets.
And then we have debt and liabilities statements.
We therefore mainly use financial and accounting data, but of course we have in particular population data and other data from the statistics of Austria.
Now we have data from this period from two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen.
And that's a mistake, for which I'm sorry.
We keep updating these data, always every autumn.
Since we have data from the accounting systems of the municipalities, we have no data on the contribution of the municipality, we have no data on rental obligations, and we have no data on balances and assets, because the municipalities do not publish these data.
This is important because in practice you have an official accountant in the municipality, you find some amount of debt, and if you look at the company's contributions to the municipality, you may find this debt value here again, so it will be a duplication and if you're just checking the accounts of the municipality itself, you only have half of it.
So from the current data, we think our indicators are good, which I will explain later, and we will try to create an indicator model, and this monitoring is based on a model consisting of indicators that are drawn up as an evaluation indicator broken down by topics.
Statistics are derived from this from one to a hundred, which is most relevant for the audit.
This model thus allows indicators to be assessed by themes.
And in order to determine the relevance for the audit, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses financial situation indicators as a basic setting, but depending on the question raised, depending on the subject of the audit, you can choose different settings of indicators.
Then you get a different result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four topics and the first is the financial situation in the long term.
That means we take net debt plus liabilities minus securities holdings and minus reserves.
So the first of them gives us a long-term perspective, which means debt minus assets.
And the other one gives us a short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we are defining the basic balance, which is current revenue without transfers minus current expenditure without transfers and income.
This is an important point in the indicator model, because we do not use the key data that I have expressed per capita.
We use a different figure as a relevant figure, namely our own revenue, because it is better to show the economic strength of the municipality.
Furthermore, the administrative structure comes to the line.
There we simply put together administrative expenditure and personal expenditure.
Personal data is the most challenging task for us.
We tried to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And yes, we take account of other accounts, various accounts, representation and analysis of special accounts.
This means that using these data we are trying to find accounting errors.
This image is therefore a screenshot of one possible output of the monitoring tool
And here you see the villages that are at the end of the list, from the best to the worst.
The black column thus shows value and it is given the importance of auditing activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors. In this picture it is therefore assessed for the importance of auditing for our department.
So the four columns on the right are indicators.
Indicators of the model I explained earlier.
The black column shows the value of three whole thirty-three, which is the village of Halvank, a small village near Salzburg and is the best village.
So this is a scale.
So if you want to audit the municipality with the best financial situation, we will audit Halvanka.
If you want to audit the worst village, just skip the picture and get to the last, but today I don't want to show you these villages.
In our system we have all the Austrian municipalities, but not every municipality falls within our assessment obligations, so only the second, yes, we can audit only the second.
We try to compare villages with the same class of villages of the same size, so we do not compare Vienna with Halvanko. We try to find similar villages to make this comparison fair.
So we have many different output options for this tool, and another function is this output diary for each individual municipality.
So we have the village of Halvank, for example.
We can make such a diary for every municipality in Austria and, as you can see, you will not be able to read it, but it will provide a wide range of key figures, indicators, graphs and information on the financial situation and its development.
The next output of the diary is these two pages, where you can see, for example, an analysis of personal expenditure on the left, that's the red line of the chart.
And when compared to other municipalities, you can choose a blue line, and where the red line exceeds the blue line, the village is worse.
Or
Therefore, you can easily assess whether the municipality has excessive expenditure.
And on the right-hand side, we have transfers, which means we have outgoing and ingoing money from the village perspective.
But these are only two outputs of many.
We are currently using some statistical programmes, such as R Stat Plus, and we can carry out any analysis that is necessary - what our superiors want us to do.
As you can see, we use this audit planning tool, preparation, operational affairs and on request, which means that if someone wants to use this village only for presentation, they can use the diary.
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in the region, we can do this, and this information helps us not only in the audit itself.
And in accordance with our advisory approach, we provide the municipalities with concrete information.
This means that if some mayor calls us and wants to know about his village and what their financial situation is in this village, we can provide them with reports and journals.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you. Thank you.
<CENSORED>, are you receiving?
Should I start?
Yes, I did.
Yeah, ha ha ha, sorry.
First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your electronic data conference.
The right to access government information is a fundamental democratic right.
To do so, the government must share public information.
Since the law came into force, the company has changed a lot.
Information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
Over time, virtually all people began to use the Internet, often on multiple devices.
The 21st-century government can respond to these tasks by giving the public direct access to government information.
In other words, the government could actively publish open data.
In such a case, the volume of open data should be assessed in the context of the transition to digital administration.
The pace in this area is set here by the United Kingdom, along with the US.
Clearly, open data is not seen by these countries as an objective, but as a means to achieve greater transparency.
From a global point of view, they are leading in terms of an open government partnership.
This is an initiative to get the government to be as open as possible.
And there are several European directives and treaties in Europe that are important for the legislation and policy of open data.
The Dutch Government is also very ambitious in terms of open data and has adopted new rules.
The real implementation, however, is still under way.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former President, Mrs Stuiveling, see great potential in open data.
In 2013, we decided to follow the development of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We have conducted a survey focused on the determination of ministries to implement an open data policy.
Our approach is positive because we have focused on ministries that have done well and, on the contrary, we have tried to encourage ministries that have left behind.
Through meetings with experts on open data and civil servants and the publication of information sheets with good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we emphasised the importance of open data and followed progress.
We have identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers the government opportunities.
By openly informing the government about its spending and performance, it will have a better idea of its own financing.
This will change the way Parliament oversees the government.
Open data sets would increase the transparency and accessibility of the government to citizens.
From a commercial point of view, innovative entrepreneurs can convert open data to new applications.
One of our goals was to find out what the Netherlands could learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Using data for an open data biometry performed by the World Web Foundation, we have compared three aspects of open data.
Awareness of achieving positive results from government initiatives on open data.
The extent to which open data are available.
And impact on society, economy, and government.
Uh, the company, the economy and the government.
And if we compare-- excuse me.
I'm sorry.
My voice's kind of tied up in the monitor.
It's really disturbing me.
It's all right.
We can go on.
If we compare the UK and the United States with the Netherlands,
The UK and the US are based on this in terms of implementation and impact better.
As far as their preparedness for open data is concerned, there is little difference between them.
On the other hand, the Netherlands is much worse prepared.
This only concerns the right to information and the extent to which the government supports initiatives in the field of open data.
As regards availability, the United Kingdom and the United States are publishing much more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data sets is huge in the United States.
The type of data that countries publish differs in the number of points.
The Netherlands is currently publishing little open data on government expenditure and public procurement.
Even the Dutch trade register is not very open.
As you can see, the UK, on the other hand, has open data in all areas.
The impact of open data has a political, social and economic dimension.
From a social and economic point of view, the Netherlands is lagging behind both Great Britain and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands less uses open data to involve citizens in making and controlling government policy.
The economic benefits of open data are very small.
In both of our reports, we have given international examples that can be a good example for the Netherlands.
In Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on the waiting periods of hospitals.
We didn't rely only on open data barometers
And we did our own research.
And to get a better picture of the currently available volume and the type of open data.
We looked at the data published on our national open data portal.
In total, in February two thousand fifteen were available three thousand two hundred sets of data.
And a little more than half of the data sets were provided by the central government.
The majority of the open data published by the central government comes from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands is the public work of the Ministry.
In the case of our two reports, we have asked all ministries what steps they are taking to publish open data.
The score that we awarded to each ministry was based on six indicators.
These were, for example, the support from the management of the Ministry and the action plan of the entity.
Since our first report was published, some ministries have taken exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and what funds they provided in the year two thousand fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice did not have time or money to publish public data.
However, other ministries commissioned several staff to publish open data and released the budget for these activities.
Based on the examination of the years of two thousand thirteen and fourteen, we have come to the conclusion that open data is the standard but are not yet applied in practice.
And given what was established in the area of open data, it was mainly about the government, what the government knew, rather than what the government was doing.
We also received a few comments that rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should better inform about the data available.
They should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third was that the government had to invest in both, both on the supply and demand of open data.
For example, by setting up an Institute for Open Data.
For our report for the year two thousand fifteen, we have discovered that the government and ministries have taken steps to widerly accept open data.
And partly in response to our first report on open data, the Interior Ministry is currently coordinating the entire government analysis of the data set.
The Netherlands follows the good examples set by Great Britain and the United States.
There was a disadvantage.
We have also found that the open data provided through the national portal was unilateral.
Practically all open data sets are geo data, geographic data and almost all are published by a single ministry.
Very few data are important, which are important for public control of government finances, and government action is available.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account for the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch Government should therefore define targets and milestones in a specific action plan.
We also believe that the opening of data should be compulsory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
This should specify which data are of the highest social importance and which data should in any case be made available.
And the government itself should use open data, for example in decentralising social networks.
In the Netherlands, this is a large national programme under which responsibility is transferred from the central government to municipalities.
Our reports have had a positive impact.
The Ministry of the Interior will publish the results of the national data survey this month.
The House of Representatives adopted a proposal for a national information infrastructure.
And based on the data inventory, the Home Affairs Ministry will set up a national open data agenda.
In this agenda, it will publish what data will be opened and when they will be opened.
We are trying to set an example.
We have published our own expenditure on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors is spending their money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open expenditure.
The Ministry of Finance is now planning to make details of expenditure available to the government next year.
It's all right.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is developing positively and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor developments,
Thank you for your attention.
If you are interested, you can find our reports on our website in English and data on our expenditure in Dutch.
we have the role of devon going to do 3 shelves for
my father
has a piece of board that is 12 metres long
He wants the top shelf to be half a foot shorter than
middle shelf
I'll do it in different colors.
So he wants the top shelf to be half a foot shorter than
middle shelf
I'll read the entire assignment first.
and the lower shelf should be half a foot shorter than twice the length
upper shelf
choose a different color
I'll do it in blue.
The bottom shelf will be half a foot shorter than twice the amount.
length of the upper shelf
How long will be the individual shelves if
consume an entire 12 metre board
Let's mark variables of different lengths of shelves
Because that's what we have to figure out.
We have the top shelf and the middle shelf
and lower shelf
So let's say that t is the length of the upper shelf.
t indicates the length of the top shelf
and m will correspond to the length of the middle shelf
m means the middle shelf
and b indicates the length of the lower shelf
b thus is the lower shelf
Now we'll find out what these different statements tell us.
So the first statement says devon wants to have the top shelf
I will use the same color wants to have the top
a shelf half a foot shorter than the middle shelf
So he wants the length of the top shelf to be
half a foot smaller than the length of the middle shelf
We have all the variables in meters so we can write
length of the middle shelf minus
12 metres
That's exactly what the orange underlined theorem tells us.
the upper shelf must be 12 metres shorter than the length
middle shelf
So what does another statement tell us?
and the lower shelf must be
12 metres shorter than
twice the length of the top shelf
So it's 12 meters smaller than twice that.
length of the upper shelf
These are both written statements.
using equations
the length of the upper shelf is equal to the length of the middle shelf
Negative 12
It's 12 meters shorter than the middle shelf.
and the lower shelf must be 12 metres shorter than
twice the length of the top shelf
So and how are we going to solve this?
well only with these two equations solve it
We can't but there's more information in the entrance
We have here indicated how long the individual shelves will be if
devon will use the whole 12 metres boards
So the length of all the shelves must
be a total of 12 metres
for production consumes everything
So t plus m plus b has to be 12 meters.
These are the lengths of each of the shelves
and she uses a total of 12 metres board
So the sum of the lengths of the boards must give 12 meters
So what can we do about it?
Well, we can express everything based on one variable.
We're going to express this according to m and then subtract them.
Dependence t on m we already have expressed
We can replace all t in equations
Relationship m minus 12
but here b depends on t
How can it be expressed depending on the m
Well, we know that t is equal to m minus 12.
replace all variables t
by this expression
This is t is equal to
We can rewrite the blue equation as the length of the bottom
the shelf is 2 times longer than the length of the top shelf
And we know that t is equal to m minus 12.
And if we simplify it a little bit, we get
the bottom shelf is equal to multiply it by two
2 times m is 2m.
2 times minus half is negative 1.
And all of that minus 12.
Or we could write it as b is equal to 2 times length.
middle shelf minus 32
That's right.
1 is 22 and minus 12 is
-32
So now we have all expressed by m and we can
put everything back
So the top shelf instead of having a t so
We're going to put m minus 12.
So we're going to put m minus 12 over here plus the middle length.
shelf plus length of lower shelf
So and we have already expressed it by means of m
That's what we just did.
here is written the length of the lower shelf depending on m
So instead of writing b here, we're writing 2m minus 32.
Plus 2m minus 32 and that's equal to 12.
All we did was replace t
We expressed t by m and we expressed b by m
Now let's add all the terms of m and the constants.
Here we have one m over here, another m over here, and
Then we have 2m over here.
and they are all positive
So 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4m.
So we have 4m.
and constant members
We have negative 12, and then we have negative 32.
So negative 12 minus 32 is negative 42, which is negative 42.
Negative 2
So we have 4m minus 2
And of course, this is still equal to 12.
On one side of the equation we want to have only
unknown m
So we're going to add to both sides plus 2 to get rid of the 2 to the
on the left side
So if we add 2 on both sides of this equation
So on the left-hand side will only remain 4m and these terms
They cancel out, and that's equal to 14.
Now we divide both sides by 4, and we get m is equal to
14 over 4, that's 72 meters because we're counting.
in meters
♪ Now we know ♪ ♪ But we're still missing ♪
What is t and b?
Let's do it.
Let's do t
t is equal to m minus 12.
So it's equal to our m is 72 minus 12 and that's going to be
Equal to 62 or 3 meters
we count in meters because we know that
It's in meters.
So the top shelf is 3 meters long
The middle shelf is 72 meters, which is the same thing as 3
and 12 metres
And the lower shelf is 2 times the top shelf
-12
And that's how much
That's 2 times 3 meters that's the length.
The top shelf minus 12 is equal to 6.
Negative 12 or 5 and 12 meters.
And we're done
And you can verify that the sum is actually 12
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 meters.
that equality is fulfilled
the top shelf is 12 meters shorter than the middle shelf
the lower shelf is 12 metres shorter than
twice the top shelf
And we're done
We already know the length of shelves that
devon needs to be made
fill in the table with integers so
So you write 430 in five different ways.
Think about it a little bit.
We can see this 4 right over here as 4 hundreds.
So 4 hundred
And there's 3 in the place of the tens, so 3 tens.
That's 4 hundred and 3 tens.
But there's another way to write it.
for example, we can only have 3 hundreds
We took 100 from the place of hundreds and now
We can put it in a place for tens
If you take the 100 and put it in a place for tens.
100 is 10 tens.
Now you have 10 tens but before you had 3 tens
So you're going to have 13 tens here.
Maybe this seems a little confusing.
Don't forget it's 430
This is 300 plus 130
That's still 430
Similarly, you can also see it as 200 plus 230
230 is the same as 23 tens.
the same way it can be seen as 100 plus 330
Thirty-three tens are three hundred and thirty.
It can also be seen as 0 hundreds and 43 tens.
43 tens is 430
Welcome to talk about the Internet
Which is what you're using right now.
Internet is a large network of interconnected computers
and more than it was created in 2014
A billion websites
A whole billion
Until recently, it was only a million.
And it was a lot at the time
for what we use the site
initially used them
scientists to share their research
for example particle accelerator
But nowadays everyone uses them for almost anything
it is possible to write with your family via social media
share with other photos
Her cute kittens
travel portals can be planned for trips abroad
And those of the news,
Find out what's going on again
and then of course you need to use the site
khan academy for study
So what's your favorite page?
I actually have a slightly better question for you.
How should the page you miss on the Internet look?
perhaps a page about you
or something you like.
What's cool is that you can program this page yourself.
and you can learn it here at the khan academy
Think first about what you're going to want to create.
Because soon you'll learn how to do it
But let's start with the terminology.
What exactly the Internet is
Like I said, it's a lot.
connected computers to websites
when the computer is connected to the Internet and provides a website
We call it a server.
according to English serve to serve
The website is written in three languages
html creating a page structure
css then edits its appearance and javascript page makes interactive
how users see this page
we use an app to browse the Internet
for example chrome firefox or Internet explorer
these applications we call browsers
browsers all try to view the page in the same way
But they have some differences
That's why we sometimes say
hoda error occurred try using another browser
what browser are you using right now
you have to use the browser on some device
for example on your laptop mobile tablet or smart TV
all these devices we call clients
clients can be very different
Some are smaller than others
Some have touch screens others keyboard
Some are black and white
website trying to look good
on all different devices
and what device you use
And that's the Internet
i.e. its two-minute version
There's a lot more we can learn about him.
But I think it's time to start writing some html and css
and create your own website
Shade 109
just for a repeat if we want to write 109
It would literally be 109 percent, which is the same thing.
Like 109 for, and now I could write a cent again.
But we already know that.
A cent means 100 literally so
means 109 out of 100
If we had 100 out of 100, we would have one whole.
But now we have more than a whole
We have 109 out of 100.
We could write this as a ratio or fraction.
It's the same thing as 109 divided by 100.
Same as 109 over 100.
So let's shade it out.
Here we have a whole we will
consider this square as a whole
In the last video, we were counting it.
It's a square of 10 to the 10th power.
is divided into 100 parts
We want to get 109 of these 100 parts.
What it's gonna look like
It means that we shadow all of them
100 parts right over here.
Let me do it in a new color.
So let's color this whole thing.
If we coloured just that, we would have 100
It would be 100 divided by 100 or 100 out of 100 or 100
I think you're starting to understand.
I don't want you to just memorize it.
It literally means 100 out of 100, or a whole.
So this is the whole square.
It's 100 out of 100 here.
The question is to color 109
We've already made 100 out of 100, but we still have to do another 9.
So let's color another nine.
So now we have 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9
This piece right over here.
That's exactly what it is.
It's nine whole squares.
This is 100 whole squares.
If we take this whole piece and add this blue piece to it
We get 109 one.
a whole square
I hope that makes sense.
Let's do a few examples.
Let's see.
first example
What is 15 out of 40?
examples with percentages we solve by converting
percentage to the decimal that we then multiply
number from which we want to calculate percentages
So 15 expressed as a decimal is 0,15
I hope we've learned that in the video on converting percentage to decimal.
in the video, perhaps
And we just multiply it by 40.
So 40 times 0,15
5 times 0 is 0.
5 times 4 is 20.
move down
So let's write a zero.
And then 0 times 0 is 0.
1 times 4 is 4.
And we get six zero zero.
So let's write a decimal.
one, two
There's no decimal at the top, so one-two and one-two.
belongs here
So 15 out of 40 is equal to 0,15 times 40, which is equal to 6,0 hundreds.
That's the same thing as 6
Another example
I hope that doesn't confuse you too much.
Now I'll try to confuse you a little bit.
unless you are confused from the previous example
What is 0.2 percent of now to figure out the number of seven?
Many people tend to say
Oh zero, two tenths of a percent is the same thing as zero, two tenths of a percent.
If you see it the same way then it's a mistake
Because let's realize that it's not 0.2/10.
It's zero, two tenths of a percent.
There are two ways to think about it.
We could say that's 0.2 over 100 which is 0.2 over 100 which is 0.2 over 100.
If you multiply both the numerator and the denominator by ten
The same thing as two over a thousand.
or we use the technique when we move
decimal by two places to the left
So if we start with 0.2 and move
A decimal by two places to the left we get a hopla
Oh
hop hop
the decimal komma comes here
So it's 0.2 thousandth.
That's the key
0.2 tenth of percent is the same as 0.2 thousandths
It may tempt you to make this mistake myself I'm doing it out of discretion
But don't be sad if you ever do it
♪ But always keep your mind sharp ♪ ♪ When you see together ♪
decimal and percentage
Now that we've figured out how to write percentages
As a decimal, we have to multiply it by a number.
from which we calculate percentages
So 0.2 thousandths times 7.
It's pretty simple now.
7 times 2 is 14.
How many numbers do we have?
beyond the decimal
Let's count
One, two, three.
So we have to have three numbers behind the decimal.
So 0.2 percent of 7 is equal to 0.4 thousandths.
You're probably thinking it's
a really small number
And that's right because 0.2 percent if we think about it.
is even less than 1
i.e. less than one hundredth
And actually, when we think about it, 0.2 of a percentage is one fifth.
And if we count it, then one fifth of seven.
It's just going to be this number.
It's important to check it.
It's always good to do your exam because
when you work with decimals and percentages
is very easy to lose in decimal places
or make a multiple of ten
So always take the exam
Now I'll confuse you even more
What if I tell you what number is four twenty percent?
from which heading
Many may burst out
I'll take 20
Which is going to be 0.20ths.
And I'm going to multiply it four times.
And that would be a mistake
'Cause let's think
I said what 20 out of 4 is, no.
I said 20 out of some number is 4.
So let's just do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of an algebra.
I bet you didn't expect this in percentage examples.
Let's say x is a searched number.
And the assignment says 20 of x is equal to 4.
I think in this form, you already recognize it.
How do we write 20 decimals?
0.20 or 0.2 tenths
And we multiply it by x to get 4
20 is the same thing as 0.2/10.
It's the same thing as 0.20 but the last zero.
We don't need
0.2 times x is equal to 4.
And there's a simple linear equator
I bet you weren't expecting this.
What can I do with it?
Two views are possible
We can just divide both sides of this equation.
coefficient for x
So if we're dividing by 0.2 over here and 0.2 over here.
So it's going to be x is equal to 4 divided by 0.2
So let's say what 4 divided by 0.2 is.
Perhaps we'll have enough space.
0.2's goes into four, let's write a decimal here.
We're going to move the decimal here.
by one place to the right
We're going to get 2 and we're going to have to move the decimal here too.
by one place to the right
02 goes into 4 so many times
As 2 to 40
And that's easy
How many times does 2 go into 40?
2 is in four 2 times
And the zero goes into 2 zero times.
2 is in the age of 40 times 20 times
2 is in the age of forty-twenty times
So 4 divided by 0.2 is 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 out of 20.
And it makes sense
There's more ways to think about it.
20 is exactly one fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
That's right.
We can do the test for sure.
Let's figure out what 20 out of 20 is.
So 20 out of 20 is equal to 0,2 times 20.
And if we're going to count it, it's going to be 4 as well.
So we made sure that the result was correct.
Let's do another similar example.
selecting numbers randomly
So let's say 3 is 9 out of what?
Again, x is equal to the number of which 3 is 9.
You don't have to rewrite it like that.
So we know that 0.9 times 0.9 times 0.9 times x is the same thing.
As 9 of x is equal to 3.
So x is equal to 3 divided by 0.900.
We're dividing by a decimal.
So we're going to write a decimal.
and a few necessary zeros
We move the decimal by two places to the right.
We have to move it two seats over here, too.
009 goes into 3 so many times
As 9 to 300
9 goes into 30 three times.
3 times 9 is 27.
I think I'm seeing a pattern here.
Thirty-three 3 times nine is 27.
30 will be repeated
It's still going to be out 3
It comes out that 3 is 9 of you can also write.
333 periodical we also know that 03
It's actually one-third.
So 3 is 9 out of 33 and one third.
i that's an acceptable answer
often when we process with percentages
Looking only for approximate result
Accuracy is not so important here
But in this case, we'll be precise.
as well as in tests and there
where it is necessary
I hope it wasn't too fast and you've got a percentage from calculating
feeling good
in examples with percentages is required
Watch how they're written
if specified, find 10 out of 100
It's simple.
Just convert 10 to a decimal and multiply it by 100.
But if the input is 100 is 10 out of what?
It is important to realize that this is another example
What number is one hundred ten and if we calculate it
It'll be from a thousand.
Maybe I spoke fast enough when counting the percentage.
But I hope that doesn't confuse you.
I'll upload more examples
You may have heard the concept of libor when people talk about interest rates
or say I lend you money by a few percentage points over the £ rate
will hear the libor rate quoted on some financial news channels
And it's just the average of interest rates at which banks borrow each other.
and calculated by the British Banking Association
In fact, thomson reuters for the British Banking Association is calculated
there is a certain comparison between other types of securities and financial transactions
and literally means London's interbank bid rate london interbank offered rate
It's in London, it's the rate offered between banks.
London Interbank Offer Rate
To understand a little bit better, we've set up two banks here.
Bank a a a bank b and you may already know
That when you go and deposit your money in the bank
The bank won't keep all the money.
The way he makes money is that he lends a good portion of the money to other people as loans.
And they're just holding enough money in their hands
These things you know, people could actually come in and ask their money from their current account.
We've got enough in our hands
You can imagine that the bank is going to get into a situation where it has little cash.
or can reach close to the minimum reserve requirements
which the national central bank requires the bank to have
In these situations, let's say that the bank is getting into that situation.
They said let's go and borrow some money.
Let's go and borrow money from another bank.
This is interbank lending.
Bank b here is overwhelmed with cash
say we don't want to hold so much cash
We want to borrow it we can actually get interest on cash we don't get interest
For example, bank b lends money to the bank, and
Maybe he lends so much cash.
This is the new cash that the bank got, and
Here's the new cash.
And, of course, it's a loan.
This is a new loan to settle it. Remember.
that assets are equal to liabilities plus equity
The liabilities are all here
This is a loan from the bank b for this cash.
They have a little better reserve.
And now the bank b loan increased and their cash decreased
This is a loan to a bank, and
Here they took this cash and gave it to the bank, and
And the rate at which they borrowed it,
1 annual rate was needed
and of course it renews every day it's a day rate
This rate is an interbank rate
What are they doing on behalf of the British Banking Association?
They're doing surveys in a series of banks in London
8 12 16 banks in London
They said, look at what rate you're all trading at.
and will determine it,
determines this as a day-old libor rate
They identified it say 12 across all the banks from the survey
But what's interesting about the libra rate is that it's shown in ten currencies
It's not just in sterling dollars.
or yen is in ten currencies
That's what distinguishes her from other things.
But it really distinguishes her from the actual federal fund rate, which is another interbank lending rate.
But it's in the usa
and more subject to political pressures
The federal bank is actually trying to change it.

Apparently, it's in the mountains.
No, I'm kidding, we have other real cities than Vienna.
