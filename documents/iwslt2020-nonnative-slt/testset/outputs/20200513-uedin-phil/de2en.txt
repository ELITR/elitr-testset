Hello. Hello.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, that's a very nice T-shirt.
What kind of brand is that?
Oh, it's not a brand at all, it's a logo of my botel.
Oh, really?
You got a botel?
Oh, yeah, I did.
It is located in the heart of České Budějovice on the Vlatava River and has three types of rooms.
The first category is called Goldfish, it is the most luxurious room in our botel.
Then comes the second category, Silverfish, and the third category is Bronzefish.
Wow, do you have any special rooms?
Oh, yeah, we did.
We have a special room for lovers, where you can spend your wedding anniversary and stuff like that.
Wow, you also have a restaurant...
Oh, yeah, we did.
We have a restaurant for our guests, which is also open to the public, but our guests eat there for free.
And if you spend more time in our restaurant than you wanted - you know, this can happen - you can use our fitness centre with the latest equipment.
Wow, sorry, I don't like fitness, you have massages and...?
Well, if you are not so keen on fitness, you can visit our relaxation center with massages, sauna, hot stones and so on.
Wow, okay, I like that, great.
And I would like to add that we have free Wi-Fi and free parking for our guests throughout the botel.
Oh, wow, thank you.
I hope you'll come.
I will.
So, hello everybody, my name is <NAME> and I would like to introduce the G and T LTD company.
I'm working in the management.
We are from the Czech Republic and are studying at the University of Economics.
The company's headquarters are in Neveklov.
I'm here today to introduce my company.
Our company is a Ltd, but we're not a big company.
Our company has seven employees and three departments.
The first department is the economic department, the second is the financial department and the third is the management.
Now, I'd like to tell you what our company is making.
Our company creates advertising for other companies.
We make stickers for cars, pencils, cups, advertising boards and more.
We also make marketing items.
For example, we make business cards and catalogues.
At the end of my speech, I would like to thank you for your attention and invite you to stand number 47.
Thank you.
Nice weather outside...
Yeah, it's pretty hot today.
Yeah, I think it's a good day to go out for dinner, don't you think?
Yes, but I don't know with whom; do you know anyone?
I know an amazing Venetian entrepreneur.
Who's that?
He's standing right in front of you.
Seriously?
Yeah, I'll pick you up at eight o'clock.
I didn't say yes.
Not yet. Where am I supposed to pick you up with my Lamborghini?
What do you think?
Just what I said; my Lambo was supplied yesterday by my company from Italy.
So you're in the transport business?
Yes, I have a company in Venice, it's called Idoge; we deliver and ship worldwide.
What's the name of the company?
Idoge; we also sell equipment that can make pasta, for example, Italian pasta.
Oh, that's interesting.
And that's not all: we started in 2016, it's not so long ago, but our customers trust us; we're very well-known for our professionalism, they give us really excellent feedback and outstanding reviews.
And that's why I'm taking you to Mario's restaurant today so you can taste pasta made with our appliances.
Man, you're too confident.
That's because I'm proud of what I'm doing.
So, are you waiting for me at home?
Oh, I'm very pleased to meet you, but I'm already scheduled.
Oh, I'm used to that...
Bye, good luck.
I'm sorry...
Ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to introduce myself.
My name is <NAME> and I am the representative of the company Masáže Petr Klíč, which is active in the wellness area.

We live in a time when everybody's in a hurry.
And... doprčic.

One way to do this is to make a massage.
Massages are as old as mankind.
That's what our company is for.
We offer you... doprčic, magnetic field therapy, a salt gate, a já nevim... salt gate, moor packages, herbal packages.

So, hello, I'd like to introduce you to my company called Jizeran.
We're from Liberec, brewing beer.
It started with a small group of friends who just wanted to brew beer, and after a while we found out that everyone likes it.

Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
The name of our company is Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on May 15, 2017, and it was taken over by Mrs. on September 1, 2018.
We buy clothes and suits from the Czech designers or tailor-made studios.
We pay attention to the quality of the materials. Our clothes and suits are made of recycled and natural materials.
We also want to talk about environmental problems in the fashion industry.
The fashion industry is primarily responsible for pollution.
That means we're making over 150 billion garments and another billion garments are being burned or dumped into garbage landfills.
In 2030, the fashion industry will grow as the population increases.
The classic process in the manufacture of clothes is: procurement of materials for... fabrics to make fabrics, weaving fabrics, preparation, which means colours and patterns, and the last step is the sewing and finishing of clothes.
Thank you for your attention. Have a good day.

Hatschi... excuse me...
Health... Wow! That's a great hat!
Yes, of course! This is our flagship product, we are Hat&Cap from Italy.
Wow, so you're making hats?
No, we marketed them, we're all young people with innovative ideas.
Wow!
But that's a breathtaking hat!
Wow! But... but I think it's very expensive, the quality is excellent.
Yes, we actually use the best materials on the market because we aim for complete customer satisfaction.
But how can I buy one of them?
They reach us via social media.
There you will find our catalogue and our sales conditions.
That sounds good!
And you know... we're at the trade fair at booth number 92.
Come and visit us!
Really?
But I don't think I really need to buy one of these.
Goodbye!
Hey, my hat, my hat!
I'm tired.
This rail traffic is so exhausting.
I have to sit somewhere.
Did I hear right?
Are you looking for a comfortable chair to sit on and rest?
You're in the right place at the right time, and I'm probably the right man.
Another annoying seller who wants to advertise his product.
Wait, wait... Before you make a hasty conclusion, I'd like to introduce you.
My name is <NAME> and I am the boss of New Design World.
Our company was founded in northeast Italy in 1981 by a group of young people who combined their passion for furniture.
We would like to make our high-quality and refined products accessible to a wide range of users.
Our comfortable chairs, for example, are the right compromise of beauty and elegance.
Oh, interesting.
That sounds like a good proposal.
I was really trying to upgrade my office, so go on.
We want to offer something that focuses on the customer without ever giving up quality, and that is why we want to offer our refined products on the basis of user statements.
And that's why...
Are you interested?
Yes, you convinced me!
Fantastic!
And now that you have planned the foundations of your office, why don't you look at our modern bookshelves and tables?
They are carefully selected, environmentally friendly and completely manufactured in Italy, like all our products.
Oh, that was a hard day!
You're right, very hard!
Do you think it's worth it to be here at the fair?
Yes, of course!
You know, I'm very confident about selling fashionable and trendy products like bed linen and furniture...
People are being made to buy from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are manufactured in Italy: anyone who gives something to high quality knows that.
Yes, you're absolutely right, but don't forget, we're here to get in touch with new customers.
Will we be able to reach these new markets?
Well, you know, our seat is in Veneto, and that's an advantage: we're so close to these markets, Eastern Europe is right around the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will cost a lot of money!
It is foreseeable that they will lose 5% in the first year.
Come on, think positively! These 5% will correspond to our growth in the third year!
And I'm sure we'll gain new customers today.
Yes, you're right.
It's the case that all people have to sleep well.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, comfortable mattresses and warm sheets to sleep?
And everything is handmade by our qualified craftsmen and artists!
It's such a dream!
Yes, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!

Do you mind if I take off my shoes?
These high heels are killing me.
Of course.
I don't mind.
Thank you.
Why do you wear these high heels if you could wear sneakers?
I know a really good place selling leisure shoes.
Oh, really?
Yeah, I even work there.
His name is CaspoWalk LTD. and we offer many different shoes of different brands such as Nike, Adidas for all ages and sex.
Do you also offer unique shoes?
Yeah, of course.
I can show you some.

If I bought shoes from you, would you offer me any accessories?
Yeah, of course.
We offer laces and deposits and much more.
Here's my business card.
Why don't you come by at our branch?
Oh, thank you.
You'll find us here in this building, too.
We are taking part in a trade fair for students' companies.
Thank you very much.
We arrived on my floor, so...
It was a pleasure to meet you.
See you later.
Nice to meet you, too.
See you later.
Hello everyone, my name is <NAME> and my name is <NAME>.
I would like to introduce you to our company SETA, which stands for smartphones, electronics, technological accessories.
We are a company selling electronic products such as printers, smartphones, watches.
We are also an international company that communicates in French, English, Dutch and German.
We are here at the fair and have special offers for our customers.
One of the sales promotions concerns the Instax camera.
If you buy this camera, you will receive 100 tickets for free.
It is important to note that we grant retail discounts only for retail, but also for quantity discounts for orders from 30 products or more.
I, um, all our prices include VAT.
Uh, thank you for your time, and I hope I can see you at our stand, it's number 63.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hello, guys, my name is <NAME> and I am the moderator of today's Infomercials, which is presented by the most famous practice company that comes directly from Austria, Total Shelf.
Since 1999, we have acquired the entire market and destroyed the dreams of other companies.
Our managing director has already led this successful organization when some of you hadn't even been born.
Imagine that.
So, where are our branches?
They're obviously in the mountains.
No, just joke, we are actually represented in real cities like Vienna.
What about our dress code?
Short skirts and short leather pants, no, just joke.
But we'll relax our traditional dress code at one of our countless parties to drink a beer or something.
Okay, let's make it two.
So why should you buy our products?
We have been selling our most popular products, which, incidentally, have become quite cult since 1999, that is, for two decades.
And... like, for example, the helping hand, the perfect storage for all kinds of clothes, as well as jackets, or spacewonders, where you can stack shoes and bags.
So, look at our store and how we say in German, "We don't care about your satisfaction."
Thank you!
So we would like to continue and I would ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to present the presentation.
OK, here I present our state of affairs.
We have two national laws to introduce European regulation of two directives.
The first law concerns paper and digital publications.
You now have the same rate of taxation,
And under certain circumstances it's zero rate and under other circumstances it's six percent.
For real estate rental, we have adopted a financial activity tax option for the rental of real estate by its nature and a compulsory VAT for short-term rental of real estate.
Then we did two audits,
One of them is most of what we have heard of several times, so I will be very brief.
The second is for an approved cash register system,
And here we also have two new four trends.
Therefore, our audit on most of the matter is neither unfinished,
Not yet published. All conclusions and recommendations are only provisional,
But we are very confident that there will be no major changes.
M m m.
Our conclusions contain very similar comments as we have already heard today, but for us I would just like to point out a few things that are different but which, in my opinion, are more or less specific to Belgium.
Meanwhile, we have limited staff in our administration, because we generally work as a recipient rather than a Member State of identification which transfers money, and we rely very much on the other Member States.
But in the future, when most of the workforce is expanded, we will need more staff and these staff should already be planned and trained.
Another general conclusion that we have made, and which we are already hearing more or less, is that a change in control policy is taking place.
There must be a new attitude, but our administration has strong confidence in other Member States of identification, because we regard the conclusions as Member States of consumption.
Just a leap from one pattern to the other.
We see that there is a very poor control policy, so we believe that each Member State of identification sends or transfers the money.
This is because of us.
However, we have pointed out that it is important to make progress in control policy by creating risk profiles.
So far, our administration has not been able to create good risk profiles because it does not have enough data, but it hopes it will succeed.
I will have more data in the future, and I will make some risk profiles, so we will follow up on this matter if control policy improves.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We're monitoring other taxpayers on the Internet, there's a system to find taxpayers on the Internet, but at the moment the results are rather bad.
We haven't found a lot of taxpayer's stuff.
But we'll see.
As the registration procedure of the Member State of identification, it is fine, but not in the circumstances in which taxpayers are unregistered.
There is no follow-up if they have entered and declared anything in the regular system.
So there is no link or no follow-up system, which we still consider important.
Then we have something to do with the declaration procedure.
There are some automatic checks that we think are very interesting; however, it is not a real check of completeness and accuracy (yes, thank you), but it still helps if frequent mistakes are made.
The actual controls must therefore be carried out by the Member State of consumption, but as a Member State of identification, Belgium continues to help fill in the declaration, i.e. certain errors still exist.
A warning is displayed in the system, or if you have to make a selection, all the options are limited and you can only click on the available selection options so that there are fewer errors.
Average
As a Member State of consumption, we have also found that this is working in the Benelux countries.
With Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, a matrix of certain risks has been created and control activities are now being developed.
With regard to these risks, there are already two test files that have been started for the time being.
We have therefore recommended that we continue to work in this small group in order to make progress and to extend knowledge to European forums.
I think these are the differences that we have gained from this, which we have not heard before.
Let us now proceed with the second audit.
A check for the cash register system has been carried out.
This audit was not carried out by Luden and me, but by other members of the audit unit.
It was also a test that was much more comprehensive than just VAT, but I will only present the conclusions and recommendations that are important for VAT.
The audit concerned the effectiveness and effectiveness of the control policy.
Two problems related to the registry cashier system were examined during installation and application.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations concluded that the Recommendation Regulation is too complex.
It was recommended that the Regulation be simplified because the Regulation and the national rules allow too many derogations.
Because it was very difficult to identify a certain group solely on the basis of the declaration.
Therefore, it was also very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that were to install the cash register system.
Another important conclusion concerns control policy.
There are problems with the choice of the taxpayers of the cash register system.
Since a threshold was set, the threshold has been applied, and if the tax declaration is too low, you fall below the fair threshold and there is no control, so it is a way of escaping tax rules.
There was also a problem with cross-checking of information from the databases to select taxpayers in order to check them.
Another conclusion was that there were also poor internal controls on the application of the system.
It has been found from the fines imposed that different control units have imposed different fines.
So there were no rules on fines, but some control teams were very severe, because the others were not at all severe, or they imposed fines that were far below the rates imposed for certain specific errors, including risk analysis and online access.
It would be an advantage, but it is not implemented now, so the risk analysis was only very elementary and there was no online access, but now we have learned that such a system exists in other countries if they have online access.
They discovered that this could be a very good advantage.
In addition, the exchange of information with the National Social Security Office did not work too well.
So much information was not passed on from one party to the other.
Finally, something about the effects of the system.
There was still a problem when entering transactions
The system as such works very well if it is used in the way it is to be used, but if certain transactions are not entered into the system, they cannot be recognized.
So the solution could be to launch a media campaign for customers in order to ask for a sham.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise, it should not be a fake, but legislation would be adjusted to allow only electronic payments to be accepted, as it would make it easier to track money flows.
However, there is no reliable measurement of the management of impacts, so they have no idea of it.
And then our team did some tests and tried to find some effects, but found that there was a preference effect here, as the introduction of the system was delayed by a few years.
But everyone knew it was supposed to happen, and that's why customers and companies have already anticipated which laws would change and how the system should be introduced.
It was therefore very difficult to identify the exact differences between VAT revenue before 2016, when the system was introduced, and thereafter.
After all, a few years before 2016, VAT returns increased just in view of the new system waiting for it and the consequent changes.
So our team wasn't sure about the result.
This was just about this system, or that the effect was even bigger, because it started earlier than suspected.
Look, may I interrupt now, I have a problem and I want to understand it correctly.
What am I supposed to mean by the term cash register system?
Does this mean that this cash register system is registered somewhere in a database?
No, it's not online, it's a cash, a cash.
Yes, so it's only for cafes, hotels, restaurants.
It's just for a certain branch.
Currently, it is only available in the HoReCa industry (hotels, restaurants and cafes) and it is called a system that should register each transaction or record any extrapolation entered into the system.
There's no online access here.
Therefore, the selection of the control group is very important, as the control teams have to visit different locations.
The control team cannot view the locations online on a computer, but must go to the HoReCas and connect their computer to their registration cash register.
Then it gets the data out and carries out the control.
Yes, but it can't do this from a distance.
The inspection team must always go to the premises itself.
Then and therefore, if a tax declaration is too low and is below the threshold.
The teams will not go there just to see if, for example, they know the cafe and know that there are many customers visiting them and they have not been admitted, but that's just a coincidence.
But they only discovered this later, so they're going to go there.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was worried that I was the only one who didn't understand.
Okay, but what's the difference between this system when you talk about the cash register system at every seller, by saying that in a grocery store.
Then what's the special thing about this particular system that we have?
A special software is available to detect any possibility of fraud with the system, and this software also ensures that the data can be transferred to the computer of the control teams.
By contrast, with a normal cash register system, you cannot extract the data in the same way.
So this is a cash register system that has an advantage.
Average
Yes, there are also other special control tools, I think there are five different brands of cash register systems that you can choose from and which have a certification.
All data that can be extracted in the data formats are suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yes, so the compatibility is certified, that's the other part of the main domain.
Yes, you mentioned this risk analysis, rather, there was a lack of risk service analysis or it had not been carried out at all.
I mean online access to this analysis or
Online access to the registry office itself.
Well, this is what could make checks much easier, and since we could then carry out automatic checks or extract data.
What could be integrated into a larger system and the risk analysis was really only very elementary because there was not enough data available.
This was also due to the fact that this audit or system was not introduced until the year 2016, so that they could only work with data of two years.
Okay, let's finish this.
I have seen two new fraud trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called “marriage”: it was the registration of many foreign companies.
But always through the same two managers, a Russian, a Bulgarian.
But they registered under the names that were very similar to the already known names.
There was only a difference in one letter and only to make it credible that these companies exist, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they made only one VAT declaration and requested VAT refund with false invoices, but they have always submitted this declaration in paper and for very small amounts.
This means that the administration had to enter all the information itself into the system, which took some time.
And so some refunds were already made before the administration could actually find out that there was a possible fraud, and before it could verify whether the company actually existed and whether the invoices were genuine.
But this kind of fraud has been discovered and the information is being disseminated through Eurofisc, so I think that every tax administration is now aware of this kind of fraud.
Another fraud concerned green electricity certificates, which were very similar to former CO3-2 certificates.
This was a scheme more or less in the same sense as they sent the invoices.
Or they use invoices on behalf of a company that very much resembles a legal company that should send the invoice.
So we had a schedule that I very briefly summarized and didn't take a picture of it.
But I want to explain it this way.
It was therefore a company A in one Member State X which wanted to sell these certificates to company C through certificates from company B in another Member State A.
Another company in another Member State Z sends the last company an invoice from an A with accent marking company.
This is also the company with the name, which has only one letter difference from the original.
Consequently, company C cannot recognize that a fraud is actually taking place here.
And of course, it was company A and company A with accent marks that represented the same managers and owned company A, and the A with accent marks company would be the missing dealer.
I hope this kind of scheme is clear.
That was the end of my presentation.
If you don't mind.
I would ask you, Polish colleagues, to hold the presentation.
Thank you.
And let me just refresh so that I can say a few words about the new rules, the new instruments that were introduced last year and this year.
Some of them were presented at our plenary session in Warsaw last year.
So those of you who were in Warsaw know them very well.
So I would just like to remind you briefly of a few of them, and then I will tell you about our previous examination in this area and our findings.
The first legislation I would like to mention is therefore a uniform audit concept.
The introduction of this instrument started three years ago.
But last year was the year of the last phase, because the first phase was that the only audit file was the one that had to be submitted to the tax administration on request.
And now this is an automatic system.
And the information must be transmitted electronically without request.
It has been in force since 1 July of last year.
This is compulsory for all types of businesses.
And since J. 2016.
It was compulsory for larger companies, then for medium-sized, smaller and now for all companies.
I will also return to this because we regard it as the most important in the fight against VAT evasion.
The second legislation I would like to highlight is the so-called ‘fuel package’, and this legislation has been gradually reintroduced.
It depends on the nature of the undertaking and the idea is that the fuel trading licence is granted only to undertakings established in Poland, i.e. to all Polish branches of foreign undertakings registered for VAT in their countries, and that undertakings of the same type are entitled to benefit from their procedures for suspension of excise duty on intra-Community purchases of fuel, and that VAT resulting from intra-Community purchases of fuel can be paid immediately after
The next legislation is the transport package.
I can say that the draft law was based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this kind was introduced in Hungary, but in Poland we have introduced this system of monitoring the movement of goods only for certain categories of goods.
Generally speaking, the goods subject to excise duties.
I am referring to fuel, tobacco and some others, and monitoring means monitoring the transport of these goods by public roads or rail.
This means that each individual transport must be reported prior to the start of the transport, in a specific system, a specific system and, moreover, since last year, each transport has been connected to the tracking system.
Thus it is possible to verify each truck where it is located.
About the routes, the parking spaces, etc.
And the Finance Minister for the Ministry of Finance, who analyzes the entire system of large-scale data, is informed by Online, one of the public institutions, and as we now know, they can get many results and find any irregularities, and identify the economic entity that offers such a transport that is extraordinary in terms of routes, time, etc.
And this year, we are planning to review the Ministry of Finance.
How the Ministry of Finance is willing to verify and use these analyses, because the system is implemented according to the requirement that all these units must register all transport, and the system is ready in the sense of the analysis currently running online.
At the moment, however, we do not know whether the Minister of Finance uses this information for tax administration measures.
The next legislation is something similar to what our tech colleague introduced yesterday.
So we have some sort of blacklist, but in Poland the blacklist means a list of companies that have been removed from the VAT register.
And we have a system based on the information provided online by banks and the other entities in the financial system.
And this system enables the Finance Minister to identify any irregularities, and the system aims to record exceptional transactions and to communicate them online to tax authorities.
Based on this information, the tax administration can block the account, the bank account and the respective transaction.
What is the risk of collecting an amount higher than 10,000 euros.
The next legislation is the shared payment introduced last year.
For the time being, this is only an option.
In fact, however, it is an option for the buyer.
If a part of the contract uses this, the method of payment is of course mandatory for the supplier.
And what is important if this shared payment mechanism is applied, then the solidarity of the taxpayer is excluded.
I will show you and give you some figures on the use of this payment mechanism in a second.
And the penultimate legislation and organisational instrument that our colleague from the Ministry of Finance presented in detail last year.
So we have a new national financial and tax administration based on the former fee administration, and now we have an administration that combines the tax and customs administrations in one system.
And an online registration system.
Ha ha ha.
Currently, we have the compulsory type of cash register system and the compulsory elements of these register registers with electronic storage.
The tax administration can therefore check the register registers using the memory of the authorized type, but we start with the online registration system for only a few industries.
First of all, we operate legal services, medical services, fuels and only a few specific subsectors.
And that means preparing for the establishment of a central system, which will be managed by the head of the national financial administration.
In this system, all these transactions should be immediately and easily registered online.
And so we raise the question in discussion of how the split payments could be implemented for all sensitive taxpayers.
In fact, this means that we want the tax administration to replace the reverse liability mechanism with this shared payment mechanism and solidarity liability.
All sectors in which the reverse liability mechanism or joint and non-compulsory liability is binding could be covered by this shared payment mechanism.
And as I said, I want to say a few words about our examination.
We carried out the test last year.
The period covered by the audit was quite long, since it was twelve years; we were asked by the Committee on Public Finance of the Polish Parliamentary Chamber to carry out such an audit.
Our results were as follows.
We found that the effectiveness of the work of the Ministry of Finance during this long period of time varied over the subperiods of these years.
In the years 2010 to 2015, we believe that the Ministry and the tax administration have made some inadequate efforts to improve the efficiency of VAT revenue.
One of the indications, as the subject of the audit was the supervision by the Ministry of Finance of tax collection or tax revenue, is the collection of VAT.
And one of the indicators of the effectiveness of this supervision is:
Uh, the VAT gap.
In these years, the VAT gap in Poland averaged 24 percent, about ten points above the average level in EU countries.
So that was one of the signs for us that the supervision was not managed effectively.
Yeah, here we have it.
We can say that we have information on the VAT gap in Poland and the EU countries, since we have received the figures from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And, as you can see, the average European VAT gap, regardless of the source of information, is definitely smaller than in Poland; the figures here are quite clear.
Mmmm.
And, as I said, the main instrument in our discovery and the tax administration, and the view that has prevailed over this period, was the only audit file, and over the last two years, the tax administration has acquired the competences to use the databases to analyse them.
And for example, in the year 2017, four million bills were automatically analyzed, but only 30000 warnings were the result of this analysis process.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed was about five million, which is not too high, but there are more than 350000 warnings.
This led to an impact on income as the first phase of automatic analysis is followed by the warning sent by SMS or email.
So without any official intervention in the tax procedure, etc.
And this system, this first stage, the automatic stage, gives us the results in income, VAT revenues of more than 150 million euros a year.
It concerns the last two years 2017 and 2018.
The increase in revenue took place under the conditions of a good economic situation and improved VAT collection resulting from the broad package of legislative and organisational changes in recent years.
Nevertheless, we believe that one of the main sources of these financial results is the implementation of these single audit files.
The results of the other instrument allowing payment sharing were as follows: in the year 2018, the application of the shared payment mechanism was, as I said, voluntary.
However, we are observing the increased interest in payments in this form.
In July last year, taxpayers made 600, sorry, yes, 600,000 transactions.
More than one and a half million transactions in the shared payment mechanism were carried out in December.
The value of the taxes paid through this shared payment mechanism amounted to half a billion euros in July.
In December 1 and half a billion euros.
Overall, in the period from July to December last year, taxpayers carried out more than seven million transactions using the shared payment mechanism, and the tax on special accounts for VAT amounted to about EUR six billion.
And another information about the activities of the tax administration: Last year, the national tax administration carried out 30% fewer checks than in 2017, but with fewer checks, the percentage of checks that detected irregularities increased.
We believe that this is a result of the introduction of new electronic tools that have helped to identify the company to be properly selected as a control object.
The decline in the number of checks, as I said, was achieved by a higher number, excuse me, the decline in the number of checks was accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical examinations, which obviously are less painful and time-consuming for the taxpayer.
And it resulted in a 100 percent increase in findings last year compared to the year 2017.
In our opinion, in recent years Poland has largely been the time to implement the various laws.
And the overall results are sufficient.
However, we must remember that the economic upheaval has been quite good.
It is therefore difficult to divide the source of these revenues between them.
The results of the new organisational and legislative instruments.
And only the results of the general economy.
That's all.
Thank you for your attention.
If you have any questions, we'll try to answer them...
Do you have any further questions from your side?
If not, I would kindly ask our Romanian colleagues to leave.
Okay, hello.
Can you hear me?
Yes?
In Romania, the nineteen percent of VAT we have had in the last two years remains.
And even though there were plans to reduce it to 18 percent, this has been postponed for the time being.
We also have two reduced VAT rates, the nine percent and the five percent.
And last year there have been some changes to the products that may have the reduced rate.
The biggest change was in waste water, which was reduced from nineteen percent to nine percent from the first of January of this year.
The others stayed the same.
And there was a little, a lot of changes at the five percent rate, mostly some of the products, which were nine percent, were reduced to five percent.
The biggest and the last was from the first of June of this year, in terms of high-quality food, mountain products and equivalent and traditional products.
And to do this, the products must be bred on a mountain or like the cows or sheep live at least half of their lives there.
And the manufacturer must obtain an approval, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
Thus, he can apply the reduced rate.
Next we have the reverse control mechanism.
In Romania, both companies must be registered in order to be applicable.
There are fourteen products for which the rate can be reduced, and in December 2018 the deadline for some of them was extended to twenty-two.
Finally, we also have the shared VAT system that was introduced in 2017, even though it now looks a bit abandoned by the Ministry of Finance.
Since it started with more than four hundred companies in 2017 and now in 2019 the number has dropped to forty-six percent.
Just as no new companies have used the system since 2018.
This means that all companies that initially started to abolish the system have returned to the usual VAT system.
Furthermore, the European Commission has prompted Romania to cease applying this system.
So it looks like it hasn't reached its potential, so the Ministry is likely to stop it completely.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
This is apparent from the data available to us, I mean, because no new companies were registered in J. 2018 and nothing in J. 2019.
So only the companies that started in the year 2017 remain in the system, and their number is slowly declining.
In all these observations, there are still some regulatory gaps in relation to the MOSS system, which for some reason in Romania is called M1SS, as it has been translated.
But it was.
There are also shortcomings in the IT systems in the tax departments, which work together and exchange data.
This does not make it easier for companies, and last year they finally deployed an electronic machine, a machine similar to that in Belgium.
They set up the electronic registers, and companies are now obliged to use them, as the tax authorities are coming and checking whether they have all installed the registers.
But at the moment we are not really sure whether the system is fully functional because the IT system has restrictions on the part of the tax authorities.
And no new trends have been identified so far.
So that's how it is.
Thank you very much.
Right, we did this audit.
The audit report is expected to be published on 16 July.
Please keep this information confidential.
They shall be under embargo until the date of publication.
We are just waiting for the Commission's answers in all 23 official languages of the EU.
Since we only have the answer in English, this is only a formality and the examination is now over.
The title was “Many of the challenges ...” and this special report is “Many of the challenges related to the collection of VAT on customs duties still need to be solved”.
They still have to be solved.
Initially it was “to be dealt with”, but to some extent they were addressed with new legislation and new proposals from the Commission, which just mentioned <CENSORED>.
But the problems still remain that need to be solved, and we will see later.
So I start with why we have chosen this topic for audit.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
We will conclude our recommendations.
First of all, we have conducted a survey as we follow the previous research analysis.
Based on the findings of the head of this institution in the field of e-commerce, there were some audits by German colleagues and Lithuanian colleagues.
In a previously identified report on imports, we analysed the problem of removal from non-EU countries and the related problems with regard to VAT and customs duties, and decided that it was worth going in depth during this review.
The problem is that honest dealers are often excluded from the market by dishonest dealers and cannot compete anymore.
This is a problem which has also been raised by a scientific representative, such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and which is particularly serious in the United Kingdom.
Also the estimates of losses.
There are only estimates of distances from non-EU countries.
However, these estimates are not very encouraging, since, although the Commission has estimated only five billion a year, in the UK there are between one and one comma five billion pounds a year.
They estimated these losses.
This represents between eight and ten percent of the VAT reduction in the United Kingdom.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud is currently only four percent.
So we have three times the volume of fraud prevention in the UK, which represents the losses of electronic trade in goods purchased from non-EU countries.
So this is a mission.
We are not counting intra-EU distance sales here; we are not counting most electronic services here.
It is therefore about expressing our concerns.
Then, of course, we will look at five Member States – Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we have considered the number of registrations in MOS most frequently in both non-EU and US systems.
The volume of intra-EU e-commerce sales and, finally, the estimated amount of VAT that is eliminated due to the low value of Simon's release.
After examining our source by the Commission, we also visited the Commission.
These actions were intended to debug technology and the World Customs Organisations, and the deleted period ran from two thousand fifteen to the end of two thousand eighteen.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal submitted and all the proposals that will enter into force in 2021.
What are we going to do?
We have, of course, begun to analyse the answers to our survey sent by the second core group.
We continue with the questionnaire in all the Member States that we have visited with interviews with all kinds of people.
We have accessed, and this is also very important, an ABC data access to the Synergia database, the database of incidents and problems that Member States report in the MOS.
We have access to all fiscal project groups and electronic groups on e-commerce and all related project groups, so there is plenty of information and discussions about the functioning of the MOS system.
And, of course, we have received funding from the institutions of Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally we have carried out our own samples of different transactions.
Overall, we have verified nearly nine hundred transactions related to e-commerce.
What we find here, of course, are first positive things, and then we will continue to work on the most negative things.
The legal framework follows the international best practices of the OECD and the World Customs Organisation, which are extreme.
In most aspects relating to the OECD, the principle of taxation at a destination was mostly observed.
Now there is a new threshold below ten thousand euros, which you can report in the home Member State, which does not comply with the OECD rules.
For the World Customs Organisation, which deals with the imported packages, the guidelines for immediate release have been followed on most points, and this also applies to the new proposal of the standard framework.
The Commission is a pioneer in this and is in many respects in line with the World Customs Organization and standards.
For the new regulation to be introduced in 2021...
I intend to remedy some of the weaknesses, but for us the main problem that will continue to arise is undervaluation.
We are suffering and will continue to suffer losses from VAT and customs duties.
And this cannot be addressed by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As far as trade with non-EU countries is concerned, this will not be resolved and we will see why later.
Why, yes, because administrative cooperation with non-EU countries does not work?
We have a new agreement with Norway, which is very good.
We expect an intact exchange of information with Norway, but that is not a problem.
It is not Norway, the problem is China, it is the United States.
The chain of information with China does not work because the Chinese counterpart does not answer and the percentage of answers continues to decline, so that's a real problem.
If we have information about the change of supplier that does not work via an electronic interface, i.e. it works directly on its website, which is most unregistered or even registered, and then we cancel the registration, it will open a new website...
How is it that we are paying VAT from Europe to China, and we expect VAT to be reimbursed to the EU.
Although we do not have administrative cooperation.
That's never gonna happen.
This is also a problem between the EU countries, where it does not work as expected.
Administrative cooperation, as we will see later, and the checks carried out by the national tax authorities are also weak.
Therefore, there are virtually no tools to carry out a proper risk analysis of an opportunity, as has already been mentioned.
To that end, it is necessary that the Member State endorses the Commission's proposal to exchange information with payment service providers, whereby the number of payment service providers controlled by the Commission is insufficient.
And we will see later that the Commission had not carried out any monitoring, no monitoring.
There are also vulnerabilities in customised electronic customs clearance systems.
The traditional problem is certainly that traders underestimate the goods so that prices are below the two-, twenty- or ten-year euro threshold for VAT.
And this will disappear in the future, but they will continue to underestimate the goods in order to pay less VAT.
It is not agreed, but they will pay less, and with regard to customs duties, the acceptance is set at a hundred and fifty euros and they cannot make it.
Because of all the electronic support, we can look forward to an EU electronic customs clearance system, which does not stop customs declarations.
If you check the e-Customs box in the corresponding field, he/she electronically requests the duty-free application for the customer.
And it is claimed to apply the system even if a value declared is over one hundred and fifty.
The electronic system cannot stop it, they said, and this is very serious because the operators working there are hopeful economic operators.
So, the big couriers, they have an economic operator agency and pretend to be the most reliable, but they're abusing the system.
Forced collection of VAT and customs is not effective.
OK, the provisions on the information chain for the recovery of claims related to this tax.
They are rarely used by the five Member States we visited only in Austria.
Only on five occasions, so they are not used frequently.
There are inconsistencies in payments between the Member States we are analysing.
We have access to the vote carried out by the Commission and there are still unsuccessful results.
Important is a lot between Member States.
There is obviously a problem in the Netherlands that they are unable to reconcile the VAT amounts received with the VAT returns.
And there are also problems with the payment reminders, which our colleagues from the NKU also discussed yesterday.
They suspected a problem with the payment reminders of the Member States of consumption that had not been processed.
Here is the summary of our findings on the MOS samples.
We came to the conclusion that the MOS IT infrastructure is suitable for its purposes and is so strong.
The user can handle it, according to the IT infrastructure is strong, but there are problems with registrations and payments between Member States.
For example, we analysed the incidence between Member States reported in the Synergia database, but there are few 22 cases in the five Member States.
We then checked in which Member State the problem has already occurred and how the Member State is affected.
There were only twelve cases, not too many, but the problem is that the attitude of the Member States was really passive.
Only when the problems escalated they started working on it, but it took a long time to solve the problems.
As far as MOS is concerned, it takes away long periods of time, but there are not many problems.
In the case of technical error messages sent and received between Member States, the answer is also very passive and not proactive, only when the problem is spreading as an incident they begin to respond.
But the infrastructure is robust for the MOS.
We did not check whether they were prepared for the single-stop shop.
This is another matter for which we have received some complaints, particularly from Austria.
They say that they are not ready, even from the Dutch path, which we have not analysed, because the system is specifically designed for customer-specific purposes by using one-stop shop for import.
There is a problem with registration here.
We must distinguish between the non-US system and the EU system, where only eighty percent of registration applications were not properly checked.
With regard to the knowledge of a non-US system, we have even noted cases of double registration, which is something serious, in the case of payments, there is in particular the problem of the lack of residual amounts in the Member State of consumption.
And sometimes with the Member State of identification.
Further also problems with registration and cancellation of registration.
This applies in particular to administrative cooperation, i.e. the exchange of information between the Member States we visit.
And if we compare here with the overall activity of the information chains, we can see that, for example, the total information needs sent for a hundred and eighty-two are compared with the total information needs.
Not related to the average in general, nine thousand are two hundred, so not even many in the United Kingdom are even more problematic, for example three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is sometimes good, sometimes very low, some Member States have not changed anything and do not give any reason; we recommend having a separate, centralised CNO home office.
A separate structure that determines the IT business, or at least the MOS, so that the level of transmission of the information is very weak.
Then we have multilateral controls, there have been six cases of multilateral controls in two cases.
That was a really successful experience.
However, in two cases this was not successful at all, as the Member State of identification refused to participate in multilateral control.
This will be resolved by the enforcement of the new legislation, since two Member States are now able to request checks.
And there is also a recent request to the other Member State of identification that it should not refuse to participate.
I hope we will see an improvement, but there are other things that are important to Eurofisc.
There were four hundred and eighty signals to Eurofisc that a chain is fully working for e-commerce trade, and only one feedback on these four hundred and eighty signals.
So the Member State did not find this information very useful, they do not know why they were chosen, since only five Member States have included the elderly in the database.
And the others didn't read it because they didn't find the information very useful.
There is also a signal on fraud trends or themes, three or four themes that they considered useful.
And then there are changing instruments of a self-adapted Internet search engine (web crawler tools), but this is something that only some members in their countries legally use.
In other Member States, domestic legislation prevents the use of web crawling tools.
So now the work file is frozen and the frozen activities are no longer useful.
They are waiting for the proposal of the information chain between payment service providers.
That's why they want a database and may access it.
This is the Commission's proposal on all the information provided by the payment service provider from other countries.
Of course, we strongly support the proposal and include it in the report, but I did not know that even the Commission needed support for this proposal, because now, unless I asked yesterday, Lubik Lubis said that there were certain problems.
In the Council, however, I considered it a matter of course, because this proposal comes from several discussions in some forums with Member States and with stakeholders.
Hopefully this is very important because there is another problem: the lack of controls and audits for MOS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here, there's no reason for that, because that's how I can't do anything, if I don't know, I don't have a data region analysis.
So my audit will be based on a random selection and may contain lots of information and no records because certain data is needed, and these are the data.
In addition, the company will need much more applications.
Yes, it's Germany, they understand because we have the data.
No-US team, but the information could be available to him.
A phenomenon.
But I don't know, and further, there's practically no control.
Inspection of knowledge of distances within the EU has also not been very successful.
Therefore, we have the results of the sample in customs by courier from postal abuse.
To address the issue of undervaluation, the main problem in the postal offices, they have very expensive drones here, which have been declared under ten units or twenty-two euros.
Samples like this are a thousand times simpler.
And they can read, and it's very difficult to do this at the level of a post office.
And for the couriers it is easy to abuse the duty exemption of one hundred and fifty because they simply check the box for the takeover and then do not close the fifty.
In order to stop the explanation, although the devaluation is higher than one hundred and fifty, we are checking this not only in the sample, but also directly in the electronic customs system in the absent environment where we have made some experiments.
It has not worked in any Member State, it only works in Austria.
However, it was not accepted in Austria.
We have introduced another explanation for alcohol.
And then it was claimed for alcohol, and because this classification is applicable to alcoholic products.
There are also some errors in the Austrian system.
Another problem is that the authorised economic operator and the most reliable customs traders abuse the system.
Then we have a recommendation for the Commission to make use of the structures provided for in the mutual assistance treaties with non-EU countries.
In order to deal with the problems, a lack of answers must be recognised.
It is also necessary to carry out the inspection of controls in the Member States relating to the local reductions.
Monitoring the functioning of distance sales within the EU, the minimum, the one-stop-shop, which is the only recommendation not accepted by the Commission.
That's why they laughed yesterday because you stayed on the job.
The Commission makes the monitoring and <CENSORED 22:25> said: ‘Yes, yes, yes’.
I laughed, but OK.
They assist Member States in developing a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for new arrivals.
Since this is a problem, we cannot know whether the system works or not.
It is assumed that the system is mostly successful, but this is usually an assumption, and that is why we have an estimate of most VAT gaps.
We are not sure whether the system is successful, and we do not have an estimate for EU internal trade itself, so that would be very important.
What the Commission supports in developing the Member States is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to investigate the use of alternative technology solutions.
In order to combat VAT fraud, an alternative system of shared payments could be supported.
Using block chain technology, new paths are proposed, the KPMG and also the proposal by Professor E. Ensworth.
There are very interesting proposals that we have, of course, discussed with the Commission and the Commission says that they are theoretically and practically able to find solutions.
In reality, they have not found any practical application, and Professor Lamas has made some suggestions on the use of technology for imports from non-EU countries.
But this system is accepted by many other countries.
There is no practical experience, but I think we think it is also worth getting deeper into the possibilities of block chain technology.
This will also be examined by the Commission in order to manage the main single-stop database.
Numbers for managing the validity of those single-stop numbers.
It is very important for the Member States to use the new technologies, because this is the only way to manage the float for the future.
Of course, we like the fact that they have begun to respond to the fraud cases of the elderly and have redesigned the Eurofisc.
Also monitor the compensation corresponding to the new threshold of ten thousand euros.
This is something the Czech colleagues have highlighted in their report.
And we picked it up, also for the reason they explained earlier.
In order to have a separate MOS and distance coordination function in our colleagues, we must ensure that the merchant can only introduce the VAT rate, the correct VAT rate, in the MOS VAT return.
If the trader introduces a false VAT rate, he will only receive a notification, but the declaration can be sent anyway, so he will receive a warning, but the declaration will be sent anyway.
Also carry out necessary checks upon receipt of the registration application in the MOS to avoid the problem of double registration.
Increase the testing activity of most MOS dealers and remote sellers with the help of tools for administrative cooperation.
An employee of regular estimates of compliance with VAT for e-commerce.
We would therefore be very grateful if you could remind the Member States of this recommendation in your home country.
We therefore ask you to cooperate in this matter and are at your service with everything we know if you have any questions.
Mr Mayrbeurle, the floor is up to you.
Thank you.
Thank you for inviting me.
It's an honor for me to be here to speak to you.
My theme is to give you a brief overview of our mass data tool, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
Before I really start, I would like to give you an overview of the largest Austrian communities.
You can see the municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants, and from two thousand and eleven, we are entitled to audit all these municipalities.
The threshold before was twenty thousand.
The grey dots have more than twenty thousand inhabitants and the blue have less than twenty thousand inhabitants.
The explanatory notes are still available in German.
I'm sorry.
In total, we are therefore entitled to examine 75 municipalities.
This is about three points and two percent of the total.
However, we advise all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, in our department, we decided to develop a special tool, which we call a community monitoring tool.
The development team in our department consists of three young economists, and I'm one of them.
And all three of us use the instrument for different purposes.
What was the purpose, what was the objective of shaping this instrument?
The main reason was to find an analysis tool for financial risk assessment.
So we're first trying to create a profile for each community.
In doing so, we take into account all relevant factors.
In the second step, we evaluate the importance of the municipalities in the auditing activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we classify the municipalities according to the financial risk using certain indicators.
The classification is always the most interesting method, the most interesting part of the whole story, because we can compare all the communities.
Thank you.
The main challenge for each database project is to collect data of good quality.
We heard it the day before.
In this context, we are happy to use the data from the Federal Statistics Agency Austria, the Austrian Statistics Agency, which represents our most important partner in this project.
And we get the following data...
While these data are actually open to every citizen
But you have to buy them from the statistics of Austria if you want the aggregated data.
And only the aggregated data are useful for analysis.
So we have the intersectoral accounts according to the budgeting and accounting rules.
We have detailed information about the closed accounts, so we have the accounts at the free card level.
And we have records of debts and liabilities.
We mainly use financial and accounting data, but of course we have securities settlement system data separately. We have population figures and other data that come from the statistics of Austria.
What we have is the data from two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen.
Ah, that's a mistake, excuse me.
And we keep updating this data every autumn.
Since we extract the data from the community's accounting systems, we do not have data on community contributions, data on leasing obligations, and data on balances and assets, as the municipalities do not publish these data.
This is an important point, because in practice, when you go to the community and interrogate the official accountant, you find the debts, and when you follow the corporate or community contributions, it may happen that you find that debts again, so that they double themselves and you only have half of the story if you only check the accounts of the community alone.
Based on the available data, we assume that our good distribution indicators, which I will explain later, can create an indicator model, and this monitoring is based on a model consisting of indicators compiled as evaluation indicators, broken down by topic.
And from this, a statistics between one and a hundred is derived, which is closest to relevance for the examination.
This model thus enables indicators to be classified according to specific themes.
In order to determine the relevance for the audit, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses the indicators of the financial situation as a basic setting, but depending on the question raised and the question to be examined, a different indicator setting can be chosen.
And then you get a different result.
Thus, the indicator model consists of four themes and the first is the long-term financial situation.
This means that we assume the net debt plus liabilities less securities holdings and less reserves.
So the first gives us the long-term perspective, i.e. debt minus assets.
And the second issue is the short-term perspective.
Which is ... yes, please.
In the short term, we define the core balance, i.e. current revenue without transfers minus current expenditure without transfers and pensions.
This is an important point in the indicator model, because we don't use indicators that I've expressed per capita.
We use a different indicator, and this is your own income as a relevant figure, as it is better able to show the economic power of the municipality.
The next item is the administrative structure.
Because we just put together the administrative and human resources costs.
The latter was the biggest challenge for us
We have tried to assess the quality of the accounting systems.
And yes, we take into account other accounts, the other accounts, the representation costs and the analysis of special accounts.
That means we're trying to find accounting errors with these data.
This slide is a screen image of a possible output of the monitoring tool
And you can see the listed communities from the best to the worst.
The black column therefore gives us the value and refers to the importance of the audit activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors, and for this purpose it is classified in this picture according to the relevance of the audit for our department.
So the four columns on the right give us the indicators.
I explained the indicators of the model before.
And the black column gives us the value of three decimal thirty-three, as far as the community of Hallwang is concerned, a small community near Salzburg, and this is the best community.
That means it's a benchmark.
So if we want to check a community with the best financial situation, we'll check Hallwang.
If we want to test the worst one, we just jump over the picture and take the last one, but today I don't want to show you these communities.
And we have all Austrian municipalities in our system, but not every municipality falls within our jurisdiction, so that only the second, indeed the second, can be audited by us.
And we're trying to compare the communities with the same size, so we're not comparing Vienna to Hallwang, so we're looking for similar communities so that it's a fair comparison.
So we have many different ways of presenting the search results of this instrument, and another feature is this diary for each community.
Here, for example, we have the community of Hallwang.
We can create such a diary for each municipality in Austria, and as you can see, you will probably not be able to read it, but we have a lot of key figures, indicators, graphics and information about the financial situation and development.
Another yield of the diary are these two pages. For example, you can see the analysis of personal expenses on the left, this is the red line of the diagram.
And compared to the other communities, you can choose the blue line, and where the red line crosses the blue line, the community is worse.
Or
So you can easily judge if the municipality has excessive expenses.
So on the right side we have the transfers, which means that we have the outgoing and incoming money in a perspective of the community.
However, these two issues are only two of many.
We are now using some statistical programs such as R Stat Plus and are able to carry out any analysis that is necessary or is required by our superiors.
As you can see, we use this tool for examination planning, preparation, operational level and on request, i.e. if someone only goes to the municipality for a presentation, he/she can use the diary.
If you want to know which communities are worse in a region, we can do this, and this information helps us not only with the examination itself.
And in line with our advice approach, we provide the specific factsheets to the community.
So if the mayor calls us and wants to know how his community appears and what the financial situation in that community is, we can give him a factsheet and a diary.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
Marcus, are you online? Can you hear us?
Shall I start?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Ha ha ha, sorry.
First of all, thank you for inviting me to speak at your E-Data conference.
With access to government information, it is a fundamental democratic right.
And this role requires the government to communicate public information.
Society has changed greatly since the law came into force.
And information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
And now virtually everyone is connected to the Internet via a number of devices.
And the 21st century government can respond to these challenges by giving the public direct access to government information.
In other words, the government can actively publish open data.
Then the volume of open data cannot be seen separately from the transition to digital administration.
And here the United Kingdom and the United States set the pace.
You understand that open data is clearly not an objective, but a means to become transparent.
And they are world leaders in the open government partnership.
An initiative to encourage the government to be as open as possible.
There are several European directives and treaties in Europe, which are important for the legislation and policy of open data.
And the Dutch government has open data ambitions and policies.
However, actual implementation is still at an early stage.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former President, Saskia J. Stuiveling, saw the great potential of open data.
And in two thousand thirteen, we decided to monitor the progress of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the status of open data in the Netherlands.
We conducted a survey on the use of the ministries of open data.
Our approach is positive, because we are focusing on ministries that are doing well, and we have tried to encourage the ministries that have fallen behind.
Meetings with experts and officials for open data and publish factsheets showing good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we stressed the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have recognized several potential advantages of open data.
Open data offers the government favourable opportunities.
And by opening up data on its spending and performance, the government gets a better understanding of its own funding.
This shows how Parliament is reviewing the government.
Open data collections would make the government more transparent and accessible to citizens.
From a business perspective, innovative entrepreneurs can convert open data into new applications.
One of our objectives was to determine what the Netherlands could learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Based on data for the biometer with open data from the World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of the open data.
Awareness of securing positive results from open government data initiatives.
The extent to which open data are available.
And the impact on society, the economy, and the government.
Society, Economy and Government
And if we've compared... (Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I can get my voice back to the monitor.
That's very distracting.
Okay. Okay.
But let's go.)
If we compare the United Kingdom and the United States with the Netherlands,
We can see that the United Kingdom and the United States are doing better in terms of implementation and impact.
There are few differences in the readiness for open data.
If we look at the readiness, the Netherlands is not doing so well.
Only with regard to the right of access and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the UK and the United States publish open data far more than the Netherlands.
The number of collections of open data in the USA is enormous.
The type of data that the countries publish depends on the number of points.
The Netherlands is currently publishing only a few open data on public expenditure and public procurement.
Nor is the Dutch Commercial Register open.
As you can see, the United Kingdom has open data on all policy areas.
The impact of open data can be divided into political, social and economic dimensions.
And the Netherlands is lagging behind Britain and the United States in the social and economic dimensions of the shows.
This means that the Netherlands is using less open data to involve citizens in shaping and reviewing government policies.
Companies generate little added value with open data.
In our two reports we have added international examples that can serve as a good example for the Netherlands.
In Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables of waiting times for hospitals.
We didn't just rely on open data scoreboards.
And we did research ourselves, too.
And to get a better picture of the volume and nature of the currently available open data,
we have looked at the data published on our national portal of open data.
A total of three thousand two hundred collections of open data were available in February two thousand fifteen.
And just over half of the data collections are provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by the central government is produced by the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And the Ministry of Public Labour is by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands.
For our two reports, we have asked all the ministries what measures they are taking to publish open data.
The score we assigned to each ministry was based on six indicators.
For example, support for an action plan from the top and by ministerial officials.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have taken exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and how much money they have provided in two thousand fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice had spent neither time nor money on publishing public data.
However, other ministries have commissioned several people to publish open data and have released a cost frame for the activities.
And in the conclusions of two thousand thirteen to fourteen, we came to the conclusion that the open data is a standard but is not yet a practice.
And the open data published there was mainly about the government, and more about what the government knows than what the government is doing.
We have also received a few comments and they rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should give a greater insight into the data available.
It should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third said that the government must invest in both the supply and demand side of open data.
For example, by setting up an Institute for Open Data.
For our two thousand-fifteen report, we noted that the government and the ministries had taken steps to increase the acceptance of open data.
And partly as a response to our first report on open data, the Ministry of the Interior is currently coordinating a government-wide data set analysis.
The Netherlands thus follows the good examples of the United Kingdom and the United States.
There was also a reverse side.
We found that the open data provided via the national portal was unilateral.
Almost all collections of open data are spatial data, geographical data, and almost all are published by a ministry.
There are very few meaningful data available that are important for public control of public finances and government activities.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account in the development of Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch Government should therefore define targets and milestones in a concrete action plan.
And we also think that opening data should be compulsory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
This platform should determine which data should be the most important for society and which data should definitely be open data.
And the government has to use open data itself, for example in social decentralisation.
This is a large national programme in the Netherlands where responsibility is transferred from the central government to the municipalities.
Our reports have had a positive effect.
The Ministry of the Interior will publish the results of a government-wide data collection this month.
And the House of Representatives accepted the request for a national information infrastructure.
On the basis of the data, the Ministry of the Interior will draw up a national agenda for open data.
And in this agenda, they will publish which data will be opened and when it will be opened.
We are also trying to follow an example.
We have published our own expenses on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors spends on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called an open budget.
And the Ministry of Finance has now planned to open up detailed government spending data next year.
Okay. Okay.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is maturing and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor progress.
Thank you for your attention.
And if you are interested, you can find our reports in English and our issue data in Dutch on our website.

We can transform all equations so that they describe a variable.
Let's take m and then we'll replace it.
So we've already expressed t as a function of m.
We could replace anywhere where t stands
So write in m 12
But here we have expressed b in t.
How can we just write this down with m
Well we know that t m 12
So everywhere we see a t we substitute.
Because that's the same as t.
So we can write this blue equation down as the length of the equation.
bottom board is 2 times the length of the top board
But we know that t m12
but to make it easier
Let's divide it differently and calculate the brackets
2 times m is 2m.
2 times 12 is 1.
And then again minus 12.
Or we could write it down so that b is 2m.
minus 32
ok
1 is 22 in minus times 12 is 12.
So now we have expressed everything depending on m and we can now
So for the top bread t we put instead of t
So we have m12 plus m.
plus the length of the bottom board
But we've already expressed that in m.
straight straight
This is the length of the bottom board expressed in m
So instead of b, we write 2m32.
Plus 2m minus 32 that's 12.
All we've done is substated for t.
we have expressed t in dependence of m and b also
So now we combine the m equations and the constant term so
we only have one m here and another one m there and
Then 2m there.
All m's positive so
1 plus 1 plus 2 that's 4m.
So we have 4m.
What then tells us the constant equation
We have a negative 12 and then we have a negative 32.
So 12 minus 32 that's 42 or even.
So we have 4m2
And the equation says this 4m2 is equal to 12.
So we isolate m on a side of the
Let's add 2 to both sides to get rid of these 2s.
So we add 2 on both sides of the equation.
Then there's only 4m left left of the two here to lift up.
Now we divide both sides by 4 and then we get m is equal to 14 by 4.
Or we could say 72 feet because we're counting.
So we've solved the equation for m now.
missing still t and b
So let's do this.
Let's solve t times.
t is m minus 12
So t is equal to our m is equal to 72 minus 12, which is the same as
62 or 3 feet
Everything is expressed in foot so we know that
OK, so the top bread t is 3 feet long.
The middle is 72 feet, which is the same as
And then the bottom breaks twice as big as the bottom breads.
So what's the equivalent of that?
We're going to put it to 2 times 3 feet because that's the one.
So the length of the top board and minus 12 that's so.
and we're done
You can still check if the lengths together are equal to 12
5 12 plus 3 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12.
the top bread is half a foot shorter than the middle bread
and the bottom bread is half a foot shorter than 2
and we're done
we know the length of the bretter the
fill whole numbers in the table
and write 430 in five different ways
Let's think about how to do this
This 4 means 4 hundreds
This 4 means 4 hundreds
And 3 is in the place of ten, so 3 is in the place of ten.
Four hundreds and three ten are that.
but we can change a lot
For example, we could just make three hundreds.
We've got one hundreds of the hundreds.
And could give it in ten places,
If you take the 100 and put it to the 10's place
One hundred is ten ten.
So you have 10s and 3s were already there.
So it's going to make 13 10.
if it's a little confusing
Remember this here is 430
This is 300 plus 130
That's still 430
Likewise, you could consider this as 200 plus 230
230 is the same as 23 10.
Likewise, you could see this as 100 plus 330
33 ten is 330
And finally, you could see it as 0 hundred plus 43 ten.
43 ten is 430
Welcome, let's talk about the web
the matter you are using at the moment
the web is this fast network of connected computers
and from the year 2014 there are literally more than
a billion websites a billion
When I was a kid we only had a million
And we thought we were cool
what we do websites for
now researchers websites used at the beginning to share
their research like on high energy particle accelerators
But now everybody uses it for almost everything
maybe they use a social network to entertain with their family
a photowebsite for the exchange of photos
their lovely cats,
a travel website to decide where to go on an exotic trip
or a news website to find out
what is going on in the world
and of course they have to use
to experience the khan academy website
So what's their favorite website
actually I have a better question
Which website you want but do not exist yet
maybe a website about yourself
or about something they love
the cool thing is you can program a website yourself
and they can learn how to do it here on khan academy
start brainstorming what you want to do
For they will be able to do it soon enough.
let us first back up a little bit and disable some terms on
what is the web exactly
Well, as I said, it's a bundle of
connected computers that have pages
when a computer is connected to the internet
and spit out a website we call that computer a server
because they serve on the website of
a website is written with three talks
html to mark the website content on
css for styling it
and javascript to make it interactive
How users as they actually see these websites
now they use an app dedicated to website browsing
like chrome firefox or internet explorer
and we call these applications browser
browser try to show everything elbe website in the same way
But they have their differences why
we sometimes say hopla there is a problem with this browser
try another
which browser are you using right now
now they have to be with that the browser
from a kind of device like a laptop
smartphone tablet or even a smarttv
and we call these devices customers
customers can be completely different
some are so smaller than others
some have touch screens others have keyboards
some are black and white
so websites must try to work well
in all types of clients
which client are you using at the moment
and this is the railway
now the two-minute version
it's about the track to learn much more
But now I think it's about time to start writing.
some html and css make them their own websites
scratch 109
If we write 109
It's literally 109 percent and that's the same as
109 per and now I could write cent again, but that's the one.
we had already
cent stands for 100, so it's literally.
109 per 100
If it were 100 per 100 then we would have the whole but
now there are more than one whole
We have 109 per 100.
that we can write as a ratio or a fraction
That's the same as 109 per 100.
it is the same as 109100
So let's scratch this.
So here we have a whole
This square is a whole
in the last video we counted
This is a 10x10 square
it is split into 100 pieces
So if we want 109 of these pieces
What does that mean then?
It's said that we're all going to do this.
Take 100 pieces here.
I'll take a new color
So let's scratch all this.
If we just scratch these, then we'll have 100.
That would be 100100 or 100 per 100 or 100
I think you know where I'm going
I just want you to understand
that really means only 100 out of 100 or a whole
And as we can see, this is the whole square.
That's exactly 100 out of 100.
Now we should shave 109
We already have 100 per 100 missing 9
So let's scratch 9 more.
So let's go one two three four five six seven
eight nine
So this piece here has, as we can see.
Exactly
That's 9 of an entire square.
That's 100 of an entire square.
If we look at the whole square and the blue pieces over there
Here, over here, we see 109 of a
Whole square
I hope that made sense
we start with a few tasks
1 task what is 15 percent of 40
Percentages of tasks I solve in this way by
Convert the percentage to a decimal number and then multiply by the number
of which I want the percentage
So 15 as a decimal number is 015.
Average
Average
And then we multiply this number by 40.
So 40 times 015.
5 times 0 0
5 times 4 20
Place a 0 here.
1 times 0 0
1 times 4 4
returns 6 0 0
now count the decimal places
one two
No decimal places here, that's equal to one two.
And the decimal is coming here
So 15 out of 40 is the same as 015 times 40 and that's 600.
And 600 is the same as six.
now the next task
Average
Average
it gets somewhat more complicated
What's 02 percent of 7
many are deceived and
think 02 is the same as 02
but that's wrongly thought
because this is not 02
That's 02.
You can imagine this in two different ways.
first away 02 divided by 100 the portion sign means as much as divides me by 100
then multiply counter and denominator by 10
That's going to be 2 divided by 1000.
the 2 away is the coma slide technique
the come just move by two places to the left other countries use a point like here
So if we start with 02,
and go 2 place to the left
Average
So put 2 times to the left.
Then here comes the decimal sign.
that then results in 0002
That's the technique
02 is the same as 0002
this error can easily happen to anyone
So don't be so tragic when it happens
so always be careful when
and meet together,
Now that we know
what is 02 as a decimal number to be seen in 0002
We still have to multiply it with the number of which we want to know the percentage
So we multiply 0002 by 7
that's just going to work
7 times 2 is 14.
And how many decimals we have in sum.
And how many decimals we have in sum.
Average
That's one two three.
So we need to put one two three behind the decimal sign.
So 02 percent of 7 is equal to 0014
young boy that looks like a pretty small number
young boy that looks like a pretty small number
And that makes sense because when you think about it
is even smaller than 1 percent
And that's even smaller than one hundredth.
and 02 is 1500
And if you calculate 7,500 you get this number.
And if you calculate 7,500 you get this number.
and it's important to do that
it is always good to make a reality test
When one calculates these decimal and percentage tasks
It's easy to lose a factor 10 there or there.
or add wins
so always make a reality check to see if the result can be correct
now it becomes even more confusing
next task 4 is 20 percent of which number
Many think reflexively
I'll take 20 percent.
So 020
And multiply this by 4.
and that would be wrongly thought again
why
the task is not what are 20 out of 4
the task is 20 of a specific number 4
Now we need some algebra.
Average
x be this number
So the task is 20 of x is 4.
now the task may become a little more transparent
what is 20 as a decimal number
That's 020 or 02.
And we multiply this by x to get 4.
So 20 is the same as 02.
And that's the same as the 020 without the last zero.
Which here has no further meaning
02 times x is equal to 4.
And now we have a linear equation of first degree.
Average
Average
now there are 2 possibilities
You can share both sides with the coefficient of x.
Average
So divide the left side by 02, and also divide the right side.
And so you get x is equal to 4 divided by 02.
Now we're going to calculate from what 4 divided by 02 is.
Average
how often 02 goes in 4
to calculate the
we move the arrival point to the right
So we get a 2 here.
and also here move the come to the right
So 02 fits into 4 as many times as possible.
2 in 40 fits
Simple
2 fits into the 40
in 4 fits the 2 twice
In 0 the 2 fits zero times
This can also be done in the head
Average
So 4 divided by 02 is equal to 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 percent of 20.
makes sense
that you can view differently
20 percent is exactly one fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
that fits
for security we can check it again
Let's take 20 out of 20
20 out of 20 is equivalent to 02 times 20.
If you calculate that is equal to 4
with which we have checked the result
Let's do another exercise
I choose the payments randomly
here the task 3 is 9 percent of which number
Again algebra x is the number of which 3 is exactly 9 percent.
You don't have to write it down.
Now we know 009 x is 9 percent of x.
So 9 percent of x is equal to 3.
Or x is equal to 3 divided by 009.
Now we lead the division through 009 as often in 3
So we're going to put a decimal sign here.
I don't know yet how many zero we need
I'm moving the decimal sign two times to the right.
I'm also doing this on the right side
So 009 fits in 3 just as often as
Nine in 300 fits in
In 30 fits 9 three three times in
3 times 9 is 27.
that already looks like a pattern
30 3 3 times 9 is 27.
you get 3 3 3
Forever and Forever 3 3 3
the result is now 3 is 9 percent of 333
333 period i.e. the three never listen to 3333333
03 period as0 033333 is the same as 13
So 3 is 9 percent of 33 and 13.
both answers are correct
and often you want to calculate the percentage
actually have only one rough estimate
the precision is not always the most important
But in this case we are precise
and obviously you have to do in classwork and tests
be very precise
I hope it wasn't too fast and a certain
sensor for percentage calculations has been created
Important in this type of task, careful attention must be paid to
how the problem is formulated
When it says 10 percent of 100
that's easy
You just have to convert the 10 to a decimal number and multiply by 100.
But if the wording is 100 is 10 percent of which number
then you have to remember that this is another problem
In this case, 100 is 10 percent of and if you calculate that.
1,000 out of it
I think in this module we had a fast tempo
and I hope it wasn't too confusing
but I'm going to pick up more of it
Maybe you've heard the term libor when people talk about interest rates
or they say hey I lend you a few percentage points about libor
you will listen to Libor in a few of the financial news channels
what it is actually just the average of interest rates in which banks borrow each other money
and this value is calculated by the British Bank Association of the British Banks
in fact it is calculated by thomson reuters for the British bank association
and it exists in order to provide a type benchmark reference value for other securities and financial transactions
literally libor stands for London interbank offered rate
So it's the interest rate in London that banks offer each other.
the london interbank offered between banks offered interest rate
In order to understand this a little better we have set up two banks here
bank a and bank b maybe you already know
that if you deposit money into a bank account
that the bank does not just leave the money lying around
the bank earns in which it lends a greater part of the money deposited to other people
and she just keeps enough cash on hand cash
that when people come and want to withdraw money from their bank account
the cash stock is large enough
you can imagine from time to time the cash stock of the bank could drop
or very close to an art reserve requirement minimum reserve obligation
which the central bank of a country requires the banks
So in these situations, let's say bank a approaches this situation
They say let me borrow a little bit of money
Let me borrow one from another bank money
that is interbank borrowing interbank borrowing
bank b here just have a lot of cash
So they say we don't want to have that much cash lying around.
We want to borrow it so we get interest we don't get interest on cash
so bank b could lend to bank a money
So they might borrow so much cash.
So that's the new cash that bank a got.
right here the new cash
and, of course, this is a credit
So a new loan to offset that reminds you
Assets assets is equal to liabilities liabilities liabilities plus equity equity equity
So the liabilities are the whole part here.
So it's a loan of b for this cash
you now have a larger security buffer
And now b borrow her to a has grown and her cash has fallen
So this is a loan a loan to a
just they have taken this cash and given it to bank a
And the interest rate for whom they borrow it,
Maybe that was one per year.
and of course it needs to be renewed daily it is the overnight rate overnight day money rate
this interest rate is the interbank rate
So what are they doing now in the order of the British Bank Association
they go and review a bunch of banks in London
Eight twelve sixteen banks in London
And they say hey what was the interest rate in which you performed transcations
and the banks indicate that
and this is the overnight libor overnight day money libor
So they say that let's say 12 about all the banks we've been looking at.
but what is interesting about the libor it is calculated for ten different currencies
not only in British pounds or dollars
or yen but in ten currencies
That's what really differentiated him, among other things
and really differentiated from the effective federal fund rate that is another interbank rate
but he is in the U.S.A.
and which is more about monetary policy objectives
the federal bank central bank of the U.S. tries to actively control this
