cent stands for 100, so it's literally.
109 per 100
If it were 100 per 100 then we would have the whole but
now there are more than one whole
We have 109 per 100.
that we can write as a ratio or a fraction
That's the same as 109 per 100.
it is the same as 109100
So let's scratch this.
So here we have a whole
This square is a whole
in the last video we counted
This is a 10x10 square
it is split into 100 pieces
So if we want 109 of these pieces
What does that mean then?
It's said that we're all going to do this.
Take 100 pieces here.
I'll take a new color
So let's scratch all this.
If we just scratch these, then we'll have 100.
That would be 100100 or 100 per 100 or 100
I think you know where I'm going
I just want you to understand
that really means only 100 out of 100 or a whole
And as we can see, this is the whole square.
That's exactly 100 out of 100.
Now we should shave 109
We already have 100 per 100 missing 9
So let's scratch 9 more.
So let's go one two three four five six seven
eight nine
So this piece here has, as we can see.
Exactly
That's 9 of an entire square.
That's 100 of an entire square.
If we look at the whole square and the blue pieces over there
Here, over here, we see 109 of a
Whole square
I hope that made sense
we start with a few tasks
1 task what is 15 percent of 40
Percentages of tasks I solve in this way by
Convert the percentage to a decimal number and then multiply by the number
of which I want the percentage
