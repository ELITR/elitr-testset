So we have the question devon will hang 3 wall shelves for

Let's just read the whole text first.

How long each must be bread if they
Let's define a few variables for our different bretters.
Because that's what we need to find out
we have the top bread the middle bread
Let's say that t is the length of the top top board is t for
Then we make m the length of the middle board
m for medium
And then we take b for the length of the bottom
brettes that's b for bottom engl bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom b
Let's see what the various things tell us for information.
So the first statement is that the top bread.
I take the same color for this that the top bread t
is to be half a foot shorter than the middle bread m
So she wants the length of the top board to be t
is equal to half a foot shorter than the middle bread
So if we calculate everything in foot, then we get it.
the length of the middle board in foot minus
So that's what the orange highlighted sentence means.
the upper bread must be 12 feet shorter than the length
OK, what means the next testimony
and the bottom bread b must:
equal to 12 feet shorter than
twice the length of the top board t
So b is 12 feet shorter than twice the
Now we two have written down testimony as
the length of the top panel shall be equal to the length of the middle panel;
so the top bread is 12 feet shorter than the middle bread
and the bottom bread must be 12 feet shorter than
How do we solve this?
you can't solve the equations with just two equations yet
but we have more information

so the length of all bretter must be put together
'Cause she's using all the wood
So t is top bread plus m middle bread plus b b bottom bread is equal to 12 feet.
So t is top bread plus m middle bread plus b b bottom bread is equal to 12 feet.
she uses every 12 feet wood
so the length of the boards together must be 12
What can we do now
We can transform all equations so that they describe a variable.
Let's take m and then we'll replace it.
So we've already expressed t as a function of m.
We could replace anywhere where t stands
So write in m 12
But here we have expressed b in t.
How can we just write this down with m
Well we know that t m 12
So everywhere we see a t we substitute.
Because that's the same as t.
So we can write this blue equation down as the length of the equation.
bottom board is 2 times the length of the top board
But we know that t m12
but to make it easier
Let's divide it differently and calculate the brackets
2 times m is 2m.
2 times 12 is 1.
And then again minus 12.
Or we could write it down so that b is 2m.
minus 32
ok
1 is 22 in minus times 12 is 12.
So now we have expressed everything depending on m and we can now
So for the top bread t we put instead of t
So we have m12 plus m.
plus the length of the bottom board
But we've already expressed that in m.
straight straight
This is the length of the bottom board expressed in m
So instead of b, we write 2m32.
Plus 2m minus 32 that's 12.
All we've done is substated for t.
we have expressed t in dependence of m and b also
So now we combine the m equations and the constant term so
we only have one m here and another one m there and
Then 2m there.
All m's positive so
1 plus 1 plus 2 that's 4m.
So we have 4m.
What then tells us the constant equation
We have a negative 12 and then we have a negative 32.
So 12 minus 32 that's 42 or even.
So we have 4m2
And the equation says this 4m2 is equal to 12.
So we isolate m on a side of the
Let's add 2 to both sides to get rid of these 2s.
So we add 2 on both sides of the equation.
Then there's only 4m left left of the two here to lift up.
Now we divide both sides by 4 and then we get m is equal to 14 by 4.
Or we could say 72 feet because we're counting.
So we've solved the equation for m now.
missing still t and b
So let's do this.
Let's solve t times.
t is m minus 12
So t is equal to our m is equal to 72 minus 12, which is the same as
62 or 3 feet
Everything is expressed in foot so we know that
OK, so the top bread t is 3 feet long.
The middle is 72 feet, which is the same as
And then the bottom breaks twice as big as the bottom breads.
So what's the equivalent of that?
We're going to put it to 2 times 3 feet because that's the one.
So the length of the top board and minus 12 that's so.
and we're done
You can still check if the lengths together are equal to 12
5 12 plus 3 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12.
the top bread is half a foot shorter than the middle bread
and the bottom bread is half a foot shorter than 2
and we're done
we know the length of the bretter the
