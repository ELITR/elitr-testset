So 15 as a decimal number is 015.
Average
Average
And then we multiply this number by 40.
So 40 times 015.
5 times 0 0
5 times 4 20
Place a 0 here.
1 times 0 0
1 times 4 4
returns 6 0 0
now count the decimal places
one two
No decimal places here, that's equal to one two.
And the decimal is coming here
So 15 out of 40 is the same as 015 times 40 and that's 600.
And 600 is the same as six.
now the next task
Average
Average
it gets somewhat more complicated
What's 02 percent of 7
many are deceived and
think 02 is the same as 02
but that's wrongly thought
because this is not 02
That's 02.
You can imagine this in two different ways.
first away 02 divided by 100 the portion sign means as much as divides me by 100
then multiply counter and denominator by 10
That's going to be 2 divided by 1000.
the 2 away is the coma slide technique
the come just move by two places to the left other countries use a point like here
So if we start with 02,
and go 2 place to the left
Average
So put 2 times to the left.
Then here comes the decimal sign.
that then results in 0002
That's the technique
02 is the same as 0002
this error can easily happen to anyone
So don't be so tragic when it happens
so always be careful when
and meet together,
Now that we know
what is 02 as a decimal number to be seen in 0002
We still have to multiply it with the number of which we want to know the percentage
So we multiply 0002 by 7
that's just going to work
7 times 2 is 14.
And how many decimals we have in sum.
And how many decimals we have in sum.
Average
That's one two three.
So we need to put one two three behind the decimal sign.
So 02 percent of 7 is equal to 0014
young boy that looks like a pretty small number
young boy that looks like a pretty small number
And that makes sense because when you think about it
is even smaller than 1 percent
And that's even smaller than one hundredth.
and 02 is 1500
And if you calculate 7,500 you get this number.
And if you calculate 7,500 you get this number.
and it's important to do that
it is always good to make a reality test
When one calculates these decimal and percentage tasks
It's easy to lose a factor 10 there or there.
or add wins
so always make a reality check to see if the result can be correct
now it becomes even more confusing
next task 4 is 20 percent of which number
Many think reflexively
I'll take 20 percent.
So 020
And multiply this by 4.
and that would be wrongly thought again
why
the task is not what are 20 out of 4
the task is 20 of a specific number 4
Now we need some algebra.
Average
x be this number
So the task is 20 of x is 4.
now the task may become a little more transparent
what is 20 as a decimal number
That's 020 or 02.
And we multiply this by x to get 4.
So 20 is the same as 02.
And that's the same as the 020 without the last zero.
Which here has no further meaning
02 times x is equal to 4.
And now we have a linear equation of first degree.
Average
Average
now there are 2 possibilities
You can share both sides with the coefficient of x.
Average
So divide the left side by 02, and also divide the right side.
And so you get x is equal to 4 divided by 02.
Now we're going to calculate from what 4 divided by 02 is.
Average
how often 02 goes in 4
to calculate the
we move the arrival point to the right
So we get a 2 here.
and also here move the come to the right
So 02 fits into 4 as many times as possible.
2 in 40 fits
Simple
2 fits into the 40
in 4 fits the 2 twice
In 0 the 2 fits zero times
This can also be done in the head
Average
So 4 divided by 02 is equal to 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 percent of 20.
makes sense
that you can view differently
20 percent is exactly one fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
that fits
for security we can check it again
Let's take 20 out of 20
20 out of 20 is equivalent to 02 times 20.
If you calculate that is equal to 4
with which we have checked the result
Let's do another exercise
I choose the payments randomly
here the task 3 is 9 percent of which number
Again algebra x is the number of which 3 is exactly 9 percent.
You don't have to write it down.
Now we know 009 x is 9 percent of x.
So 9 percent of x is equal to 3.
Or x is equal to 3 divided by 009.
Now we lead the division through 009 as often in 3
So we're going to put a decimal sign here.
I don't know yet how many zero we need
I'm moving the decimal sign two times to the right.
I'm also doing this on the right side
So 009 fits in 3 just as often as
Nine in 300 fits in
In 30 fits 9 three three times in
3 times 9 is 27.
that already looks like a pattern
30 3 3 times 9 is 27.
you get 3 3 3
Forever and Forever 3 3 3
the result is now 3 is 9 percent of 333
333 period i.e. the three never listen to 3333333
03 period as0 033333 is the same as 13
So 3 is 9 percent of 33 and 13.
both answers are correct
and often you want to calculate the percentage
actually have only one rough estimate
the precision is not always the most important
But in this case we are precise
and obviously you have to do in classwork and tests
be very precise
I hope it wasn't too fast and a certain
sensor for percentage calculations has been created
Important in this type of task, careful attention must be paid to
how the problem is formulated
When it says 10 percent of 100
that's easy
You just have to convert the 10 to a decimal number and multiply by 100.
But if the wording is 100 is 10 percent of which number
then you have to remember that this is another problem
In this case, 100 is 10 percent of and if you calculate that.
1,000 out of it
I think in this module we had a fast tempo
and I hope it wasn't too confusing
but I'm going to pick up more of it
Maybe you've heard the term libor when people talk about interest rates
or they say hey I lend you a few percentage points about libor
you will listen to Libor in a few of the financial news channels
what it is actually just the average of interest rates in which banks borrow each other money
and this value is calculated by the British Bank Association of the British Banks
