When I was a kid we only had a million
And we thought we were cool
what we do websites for
now researchers websites used at the beginning to share
their research like on high energy particle accelerators
But now everybody uses it for almost everything
maybe they use a social network to entertain with their family
a photowebsite for the exchange of photos
their lovely cats,
a travel website to decide where to go on an exotic trip
or a news website to find out
what is going on in the world
and of course they have to use
to experience the khan academy website
So what's their favorite website
actually I have a better question
Which website you want but do not exist yet
maybe a website about yourself
or about something they love
the cool thing is you can program a website yourself
and they can learn how to do it here on khan academy
start brainstorming what you want to do
For they will be able to do it soon enough.
let us first back up a little bit and disable some terms on
what is the web exactly
Well, as I said, it's a bundle of
connected computers that have pages
when a computer is connected to the internet
and spit out a website we call that computer a server
because they serve on the website of
a website is written with three talks
html to mark the website content on
css for styling it
and javascript to make it interactive
How users as they actually see these websites
now they use an app dedicated to website browsing
like chrome firefox or internet explorer
and we call these applications browser
browser try to show everything elbe website in the same way
But they have their differences why
we sometimes say hopla there is a problem with this browser
try another
which browser are you using right now
now they have to be with that the browser
from a kind of device like a laptop
smartphone tablet or even a smarttv
and we call these devices customers
customers can be completely different
some are so smaller than others
some have touch screens others have keyboards
some are black and white
so websites must try to work well
in all types of clients
which client are you using at the moment
and this is the railway
now the two-minute version
it's about the track to learn much more
But now I think it's about time to start writing.
some html and css make them their own websites
scratch 109
If we write 109
It's literally 109 percent and that's the same as
109 per and now I could write cent again, but that's the one.
we had already
