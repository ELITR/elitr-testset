And 3 is in the place of ten, so 3 is in the place of ten.
Four hundreds and three ten are that.
but we can change a lot
For example, we could just make three hundreds.
We've got one hundreds of the hundreds.
And could give it in ten places,
If you take the 100 and put it to the 10's place
One hundred is ten ten.
So you have 10s and 3s were already there.
So it's going to make 13 10.
if it's a little confusing
Remember this here is 430
This is 300 plus 130
That's still 430
Likewise, you could consider this as 200 plus 230
230 is the same as 23 10.
Likewise, you could see this as 100 plus 330
33 ten is 330
And finally, you could see it as 0 hundred plus 43 ten.
43 ten is 430
