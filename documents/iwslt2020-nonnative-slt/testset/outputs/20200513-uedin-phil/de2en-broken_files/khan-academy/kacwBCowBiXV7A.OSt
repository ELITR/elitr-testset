you can imagine from time to time the cash stock of the bank could drop
or very close to an art reserve requirement minimum reserve obligation
which the central bank of a country requires the banks
So in these situations, let's say bank a approaches this situation
They say let me borrow a little bit of money
Let me borrow one from another bank money
that is interbank borrowing interbank borrowing
bank b here just have a lot of cash
So they say we don't want to have that much cash lying around.
We want to borrow it so we get interest we don't get interest on cash
so bank b could lend to bank a money
So they might borrow so much cash.
So that's the new cash that bank a got.
right here the new cash
and, of course, this is a credit
So a new loan to offset that reminds you
Assets assets is equal to liabilities liabilities liabilities plus equity equity equity
So the liabilities are the whole part here.
So it's a loan of b for this cash
you now have a larger security buffer
And now b borrow her to a has grown and her cash has fallen
So this is a loan a loan to a
just they have taken this cash and given it to bank a
And the interest rate for whom they borrow it,
Maybe that was one per year.
and of course it needs to be renewed daily it is the overnight rate overnight day money rate
this interest rate is the interbank rate
So what are they doing now in the order of the British Bank Association
they go and review a bunch of banks in London
Eight twelve sixteen banks in London
And they say hey what was the interest rate in which you performed transcations
and the banks indicate that
and this is the overnight libor overnight day money libor
So they say that let's say 12 about all the banks we've been looking at.
but what is interesting about the libor it is calculated for ten different currencies
not only in British pounds or dollars
or yen but in ten currencies
That's what really differentiated him, among other things
and really differentiated from the effective federal fund rate that is another interbank rate
but he is in the U.S.A.
and which is more about monetary policy objectives
the federal bank central bank of the U.S. tries to actively control this
