Since we only have the answer in English, this is only a formality and the examination is now over.
The title was “Many of the challenges ...” and this special report is “Many of the challenges related to the collection of VAT on customs duties still need to be solved”.
They still have to be solved.
Initially it was “to be dealt with”, but to some extent they were addressed with new legislation and new proposals from the Commission, which just mentioned <CENSORED>.
But the problems still remain that need to be solved, and we will see later.
So I start with why we have chosen this topic for audit.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
We will conclude our recommendations.
First of all, we have conducted a survey as we follow the previous research analysis.
Based on the findings of the head of this institution in the field of e-commerce, there were some audits by German colleagues and Lithuanian colleagues.
In a previously identified report on imports, we analysed the problem of removal from non-EU countries and the related problems with regard to VAT and customs duties, and decided that it was worth going in depth during this review.
The problem is that honest dealers are often excluded from the market by dishonest dealers and cannot compete anymore.
This is a problem which has also been raised by a scientific representative, such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and which is particularly serious in the United Kingdom.
Also the estimates of losses.
There are only estimates of distances from non-EU countries.
However, these estimates are not very encouraging, since, although the Commission has estimated only five billion a year, in the UK there are between one and one comma five billion pounds a year.
They estimated these losses.
This represents between eight and ten percent of the VAT reduction in the United Kingdom.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud is currently only four percent.
So we have three times the volume of fraud prevention in the UK, which represents the losses of electronic trade in goods purchased from non-EU countries.
So this is a mission.
We are not counting intra-EU distance sales here; we are not counting most electronic services here.
It is therefore about expressing our concerns.
Then, of course, we will look at five Member States – Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we have considered the number of registrations in MOS most frequently in both non-EU and US systems.
The volume of intra-EU e-commerce sales and, finally, the estimated amount of VAT that is eliminated due to the low value of Simon's release.
After examining our source by the Commission, we also visited the Commission.
These actions were intended to debug technology and the World Customs Organisations, and the deleted period ran from two thousand fifteen to the end of two thousand eighteen.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal submitted and all the proposals that will enter into force in 2021.
What are we going to do?
We have, of course, begun to analyse the answers to our survey sent by the second core group.
We continue with the questionnaire in all the Member States that we have visited with interviews with all kinds of people.
We have accessed, and this is also very important, an ABC data access to the Synergia database, the database of incidents and problems that Member States report in the MOS.
We have access to all fiscal project groups and electronic groups on e-commerce and all related project groups, so there is plenty of information and discussions about the functioning of the MOS system.
And, of course, we have received funding from the institutions of Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally we have carried out our own samples of different transactions.
Overall, we have verified nearly nine hundred transactions related to e-commerce.
What we find here, of course, are first positive things, and then we will continue to work on the most negative things.
The legal framework follows the international best practices of the OECD and the World Customs Organisation, which are extreme.
In most aspects relating to the OECD, the principle of taxation at a destination was mostly observed.
Now there is a new threshold below ten thousand euros, which you can report in the home Member State, which does not comply with the OECD rules.
For the World Customs Organisation, which deals with the imported packages, the guidelines for immediate release have been followed on most points, and this also applies to the new proposal of the standard framework.
The Commission is a pioneer in this and is in many respects in line with the World Customs Organization and standards.
For the new regulation to be introduced in 2021...
I intend to remedy some of the weaknesses, but for us the main problem that will continue to arise is undervaluation.
We are suffering and will continue to suffer losses from VAT and customs duties.
And this cannot be addressed by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As far as trade with non-EU countries is concerned, this will not be resolved and we will see why later.
Why, yes, because administrative cooperation with non-EU countries does not work?
We have a new agreement with Norway, which is very good.
We expect an intact exchange of information with Norway, but that is not a problem.
It is not Norway, the problem is China, it is the United States.
The chain of information with China does not work because the Chinese counterpart does not answer and the percentage of answers continues to decline, so that's a real problem.
If we have information about the change of supplier that does not work via an electronic interface, i.e. it works directly on its website, which is most unregistered or even registered, and then we cancel the registration, it will open a new website...
How is it that we are paying VAT from Europe to China, and we expect VAT to be reimbursed to the EU.
Although we do not have administrative cooperation.
That's never gonna happen.
This is also a problem between the EU countries, where it does not work as expected.
Administrative cooperation, as we will see later, and the checks carried out by the national tax authorities are also weak.
Therefore, there are virtually no tools to carry out a proper risk analysis of an opportunity, as has already been mentioned.
To that end, it is necessary that the Member State endorses the Commission's proposal to exchange information with payment service providers, whereby the number of payment service providers controlled by the Commission is insufficient.
And we will see later that the Commission had not carried out any monitoring, no monitoring.
There are also vulnerabilities in customised electronic customs clearance systems.
The traditional problem is certainly that traders underestimate the goods so that prices are below the two-, twenty- or ten-year euro threshold for VAT.
And this will disappear in the future, but they will continue to underestimate the goods in order to pay less VAT.
It is not agreed, but they will pay less, and with regard to customs duties, the acceptance is set at a hundred and fifty euros and they cannot make it.
Because of all the electronic support, we can look forward to an EU electronic customs clearance system, which does not stop customs declarations.
If you check the e-Customs box in the corresponding field, he/she electronically requests the duty-free application for the customer.
And it is claimed to apply the system even if a value declared is over one hundred and fifty.
The electronic system cannot stop it, they said, and this is very serious because the operators working there are hopeful economic operators.
So, the big couriers, they have an economic operator agency and pretend to be the most reliable, but they're abusing the system.
Forced collection of VAT and customs is not effective.
OK, the provisions on the information chain for the recovery of claims related to this tax.
They are rarely used by the five Member States we visited only in Austria.
Only on five occasions, so they are not used frequently.
There are inconsistencies in payments between the Member States we are analysing.
We have access to the vote carried out by the Commission and there are still unsuccessful results.
Important is a lot between Member States.
There is obviously a problem in the Netherlands that they are unable to reconcile the VAT amounts received with the VAT returns.
And there are also problems with the payment reminders, which our colleagues from the NKU also discussed yesterday.
They suspected a problem with the payment reminders of the Member States of consumption that had not been processed.
Here is the summary of our findings on the MOS samples.
We came to the conclusion that the MOS IT infrastructure is suitable for its purposes and is so strong.
The user can handle it, according to the IT infrastructure is strong, but there are problems with registrations and payments between Member States.
For example, we analysed the incidence between Member States reported in the Synergia database, but there are few 22 cases in the five Member States.
We then checked in which Member State the problem has already occurred and how the Member State is affected.
There were only twelve cases, not too many, but the problem is that the attitude of the Member States was really passive.
Only when the problems escalated they started working on it, but it took a long time to solve the problems.
As far as MOS is concerned, it takes away long periods of time, but there are not many problems.
In the case of technical error messages sent and received between Member States, the answer is also very passive and not proactive, only when the problem is spreading as an incident they begin to respond.
But the infrastructure is robust for the MOS.
We did not check whether they were prepared for the single-stop shop.
This is another matter for which we have received some complaints, particularly from Austria.
They say that they are not ready, even from the Dutch path, which we have not analysed, because the system is specifically designed for customer-specific purposes by using one-stop shop for import.
There is a problem with registration here.
We must distinguish between the non-US system and the EU system, where only eighty percent of registration applications were not properly checked.
With regard to the knowledge of a non-US system, we have even noted cases of double registration, which is something serious, in the case of payments, there is in particular the problem of the lack of residual amounts in the Member State of consumption.
And sometimes with the Member State of identification.
Further also problems with registration and cancellation of registration.
This applies in particular to administrative cooperation, i.e. the exchange of information between the Member States we visit.
And if we compare here with the overall activity of the information chains, we can see that, for example, the total information needs sent for a hundred and eighty-two are compared with the total information needs.
Not related to the average in general, nine thousand are two hundred, so not even many in the United Kingdom are even more problematic, for example three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is sometimes good, sometimes very low, some Member States have not changed anything and do not give any reason; we recommend having a separate, centralised CNO home office.
A separate structure that determines the IT business, or at least the MOS, so that the level of transmission of the information is very weak.
Then we have multilateral controls, there have been six cases of multilateral controls in two cases.
That was a really successful experience.
However, in two cases this was not successful at all, as the Member State of identification refused to participate in multilateral control.
This will be resolved by the enforcement of the new legislation, since two Member States are now able to request checks.
And there is also a recent request to the other Member State of identification that it should not refuse to participate.
I hope we will see an improvement, but there are other things that are important to Eurofisc.
There were four hundred and eighty signals to Eurofisc that a chain is fully working for e-commerce trade, and only one feedback on these four hundred and eighty signals.
So the Member State did not find this information very useful, they do not know why they were chosen, since only five Member States have included the elderly in the database.
And the others didn't read it because they didn't find the information very useful.
There is also a signal on fraud trends or themes, three or four themes that they considered useful.
And then there are changing instruments of a self-adapted Internet search engine (web crawler tools), but this is something that only some members in their countries legally use.
In other Member States, domestic legislation prevents the use of web crawling tools.
So now the work file is frozen and the frozen activities are no longer useful.
They are waiting for the proposal of the information chain between payment service providers.
That's why they want a database and may access it.
This is the Commission's proposal on all the information provided by the payment service provider from other countries.
Of course, we strongly support the proposal and include it in the report, but I did not know that even the Commission needed support for this proposal, because now, unless I asked yesterday, Lubik Lubis said that there were certain problems.
In the Council, however, I considered it a matter of course, because this proposal comes from several discussions in some forums with Member States and with stakeholders.
Hopefully this is very important because there is another problem: the lack of controls and audits for MOS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here, there's no reason for that, because that's how I can't do anything, if I don't know, I don't have a data region analysis.
So my audit will be based on a random selection and may contain lots of information and no records because certain data is needed, and these are the data.
In addition, the company will need much more applications.
Yes, it's Germany, they understand because we have the data.
No-US team, but the information could be available to him.
A phenomenon.
But I don't know, and further, there's practically no control.
Inspection of knowledge of distances within the EU has also not been very successful.
Therefore, we have the results of the sample in customs by courier from postal abuse.
To address the issue of undervaluation, the main problem in the postal offices, they have very expensive drones here, which have been declared under ten units or twenty-two euros.
Samples like this are a thousand times simpler.
And they can read, and it's very difficult to do this at the level of a post office.
And for the couriers it is easy to abuse the duty exemption of one hundred and fifty because they simply check the box for the takeover and then do not close the fifty.
In order to stop the explanation, although the devaluation is higher than one hundred and fifty, we are checking this not only in the sample, but also directly in the electronic customs system in the absent environment where we have made some experiments.
It has not worked in any Member State, it only works in Austria.
However, it was not accepted in Austria.
We have introduced another explanation for alcohol.
And then it was claimed for alcohol, and because this classification is applicable to alcoholic products.
There are also some errors in the Austrian system.
Another problem is that the authorised economic operator and the most reliable customs traders abuse the system.
Then we have a recommendation for the Commission to make use of the structures provided for in the mutual assistance treaties with non-EU countries.
In order to deal with the problems, a lack of answers must be recognised.
It is also necessary to carry out the inspection of controls in the Member States relating to the local reductions.
Monitoring the functioning of distance sales within the EU, the minimum, the one-stop-shop, which is the only recommendation not accepted by the Commission.
That's why they laughed yesterday because you stayed on the job.
The Commission makes the monitoring and <CENSORED 22:25> said: ‘Yes, yes, yes’.
I laughed, but OK.
They assist Member States in developing a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for new arrivals.
Since this is a problem, we cannot know whether the system works or not.
It is assumed that the system is mostly successful, but this is usually an assumption, and that is why we have an estimate of most VAT gaps.
We are not sure whether the system is successful, and we do not have an estimate for EU internal trade itself, so that would be very important.
What the Commission supports in developing the Member States is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to investigate the use of alternative technology solutions.
In order to combat VAT fraud, an alternative system of shared payments could be supported.
Using block chain technology, new paths are proposed, the KPMG and also the proposal by Professor E. Ensworth.
There are very interesting proposals that we have, of course, discussed with the Commission and the Commission says that they are theoretically and practically able to find solutions.
In reality, they have not found any practical application, and Professor Lamas has made some suggestions on the use of technology for imports from non-EU countries.
But this system is accepted by many other countries.
There is no practical experience, but I think we think it is also worth getting deeper into the possibilities of block chain technology.
This will also be examined by the Commission in order to manage the main single-stop database.
Numbers for managing the validity of those single-stop numbers.
It is very important for the Member States to use the new technologies, because this is the only way to manage the float for the future.
Of course, we like the fact that they have begun to respond to the fraud cases of the elderly and have redesigned the Eurofisc.
Also monitor the compensation corresponding to the new threshold of ten thousand euros.
This is something the Czech colleagues have highlighted in their report.
And we picked it up, also for the reason they explained earlier.
In order to have a separate MOS and distance coordination function in our colleagues, we must ensure that the merchant can only introduce the VAT rate, the correct VAT rate, in the MOS VAT return.
If the trader introduces a false VAT rate, he will only receive a notification, but the declaration can be sent anyway, so he will receive a warning, but the declaration will be sent anyway.
Also carry out necessary checks upon receipt of the registration application in the MOS to avoid the problem of double registration.
Increase the testing activity of most MOS dealers and remote sellers with the help of tools for administrative cooperation.
An employee of regular estimates of compliance with VAT for e-commerce.
We would therefore be very grateful if you could remind the Member States of this recommendation in your home country.
We therefore ask you to cooperate in this matter and are at your service with everything we know if you have any questions.
Mr Mayrbeurle, the floor is up to you.
Thank you.
Thank you for inviting me.
It's an honor for me to be here to speak to you.
My theme is to give you a brief overview of our mass data tool, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
