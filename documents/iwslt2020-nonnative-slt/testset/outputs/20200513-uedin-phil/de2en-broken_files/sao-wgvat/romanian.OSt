In Romania, the nineteen percent of VAT we have had in the last two years remains.
And even though there were plans to reduce it to 18 percent, this has been postponed for the time being.
We also have two reduced VAT rates, the nine percent and the five percent.
And last year there have been some changes to the products that may have the reduced rate.
The biggest change was in waste water, which was reduced from nineteen percent to nine percent from the first of January of this year.
The others stayed the same.
And there was a little, a lot of changes at the five percent rate, mostly some of the products, which were nine percent, were reduced to five percent.
The biggest and the last was from the first of June of this year, in terms of high-quality food, mountain products and equivalent and traditional products.
And to do this, the products must be bred on a mountain or like the cows or sheep live at least half of their lives there.
And the manufacturer must obtain an approval, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
Thus, he can apply the reduced rate.
Next we have the reverse control mechanism.
In Romania, both companies must be registered in order to be applicable.
There are fourteen products for which the rate can be reduced, and in December 2018 the deadline for some of them was extended to twenty-two.
Finally, we also have the shared VAT system that was introduced in 2017, even though it now looks a bit abandoned by the Ministry of Finance.
Since it started with more than four hundred companies in 2017 and now in 2019 the number has dropped to forty-six percent.
Just as no new companies have used the system since 2018.
This means that all companies that initially started to abolish the system have returned to the usual VAT system.
Furthermore, the European Commission has prompted Romania to cease applying this system.
So it looks like it hasn't reached its potential, so the Ministry is likely to stop it completely.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
This is apparent from the data available to us, I mean, because no new companies were registered in J. 2018 and nothing in J. 2019.
So only the companies that started in the year 2017 remain in the system, and their number is slowly declining.
In all these observations, there are still some regulatory gaps in relation to the MOSS system, which for some reason in Romania is called M1SS, as it has been translated.
But it was.
There are also shortcomings in the IT systems in the tax departments, which work together and exchange data.
This does not make it easier for companies, and last year they finally deployed an electronic machine, a machine similar to that in Belgium.
They set up the electronic registers, and companies are now obliged to use them, as the tax authorities are coming and checking whether they have all installed the registers.
But at the moment we are not really sure whether the system is fully functional because the IT system has restrictions on the part of the tax authorities.
And no new trends have been identified so far.
So that's how it is.
Thank you very much.
Right, we did this audit.
The audit report is expected to be published on 16 July.
Please keep this information confidential.
They shall be under embargo until the date of publication.
We are just waiting for the Commission's answers in all 23 official languages of the EU.
