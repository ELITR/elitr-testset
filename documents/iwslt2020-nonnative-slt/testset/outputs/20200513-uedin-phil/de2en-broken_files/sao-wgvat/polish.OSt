So those of you who were in Warsaw know them very well.
So I would just like to remind you briefly of a few of them, and then I will tell you about our previous examination in this area and our findings.
The first legislation I would like to mention is therefore a uniform audit concept.
The introduction of this instrument started three years ago.
But last year was the year of the last phase, because the first phase was that the only audit file was the one that had to be submitted to the tax administration on request.
And now this is an automatic system.
And the information must be transmitted electronically without request.
It has been in force since 1 July of last year.
This is compulsory for all types of businesses.
And since J. 2016.
It was compulsory for larger companies, then for medium-sized, smaller and now for all companies.
I will also return to this because we regard it as the most important in the fight against VAT evasion.
The second legislation I would like to highlight is the so-called ‘fuel package’, and this legislation has been gradually reintroduced.
It depends on the nature of the undertaking and the idea is that the fuel trading licence is granted only to undertakings established in Poland, i.e. to all Polish branches of foreign undertakings registered for VAT in their countries, and that undertakings of the same type are entitled to benefit from their procedures for suspension of excise duty on intra-Community purchases of fuel, and that VAT resulting from intra-Community purchases of fuel can be paid immediately after
The next legislation is the transport package.
I can say that the draft law was based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this kind was introduced in Hungary, but in Poland we have introduced this system of monitoring the movement of goods only for certain categories of goods.
Generally speaking, the goods subject to excise duties.
I am referring to fuel, tobacco and some others, and monitoring means monitoring the transport of these goods by public roads or rail.
This means that each individual transport must be reported prior to the start of the transport, in a specific system, a specific system and, moreover, since last year, each transport has been connected to the tracking system.
Thus it is possible to verify each truck where it is located.
About the routes, the parking spaces, etc.
And the Finance Minister for the Ministry of Finance, who analyzes the entire system of large-scale data, is informed by Online, one of the public institutions, and as we now know, they can get many results and find any irregularities, and identify the economic entity that offers such a transport that is extraordinary in terms of routes, time, etc.
And this year, we are planning to review the Ministry of Finance.
How the Ministry of Finance is willing to verify and use these analyses, because the system is implemented according to the requirement that all these units must register all transport, and the system is ready in the sense of the analysis currently running online.
At the moment, however, we do not know whether the Minister of Finance uses this information for tax administration measures.
The next legislation is something similar to what our tech colleague introduced yesterday.
So we have some sort of blacklist, but in Poland the blacklist means a list of companies that have been removed from the VAT register.
And we have a system based on the information provided online by banks and the other entities in the financial system.
And this system enables the Finance Minister to identify any irregularities, and the system aims to record exceptional transactions and to communicate them online to tax authorities.
Based on this information, the tax administration can block the account, the bank account and the respective transaction.
What is the risk of collecting an amount higher than 10,000 euros.
The next legislation is the shared payment introduced last year.
For the time being, this is only an option.
In fact, however, it is an option for the buyer.
If a part of the contract uses this, the method of payment is of course mandatory for the supplier.
And what is important if this shared payment mechanism is applied, then the solidarity of the taxpayer is excluded.
I will show you and give you some figures on the use of this payment mechanism in a second.
And the penultimate legislation and organisational instrument that our colleague from the Ministry of Finance presented in detail last year.
So we have a new national financial and tax administration based on the former fee administration, and now we have an administration that combines the tax and customs administrations in one system.
And an online registration system.
Ha ha ha.
Currently, we have the compulsory type of cash register system and the compulsory elements of these register registers with electronic storage.
The tax administration can therefore check the register registers using the memory of the authorized type, but we start with the online registration system for only a few industries.
First of all, we operate legal services, medical services, fuels and only a few specific subsectors.
And that means preparing for the establishment of a central system, which will be managed by the head of the national financial administration.
In this system, all these transactions should be immediately and easily registered online.
And so we raise the question in discussion of how the split payments could be implemented for all sensitive taxpayers.
In fact, this means that we want the tax administration to replace the reverse liability mechanism with this shared payment mechanism and solidarity liability.
All sectors in which the reverse liability mechanism or joint and non-compulsory liability is binding could be covered by this shared payment mechanism.
And as I said, I want to say a few words about our examination.
We carried out the test last year.
The period covered by the audit was quite long, since it was twelve years; we were asked by the Committee on Public Finance of the Polish Parliamentary Chamber to carry out such an audit.
Our results were as follows.
We found that the effectiveness of the work of the Ministry of Finance during this long period of time varied over the subperiods of these years.
In the years 2010 to 2015, we believe that the Ministry and the tax administration have made some inadequate efforts to improve the efficiency of VAT revenue.
One of the indications, as the subject of the audit was the supervision by the Ministry of Finance of tax collection or tax revenue, is the collection of VAT.
And one of the indicators of the effectiveness of this supervision is:
Uh, the VAT gap.
In these years, the VAT gap in Poland averaged 24 percent, about ten points above the average level in EU countries.
So that was one of the signs for us that the supervision was not managed effectively.
Yeah, here we have it.
We can say that we have information on the VAT gap in Poland and the EU countries, since we have received the figures from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And, as you can see, the average European VAT gap, regardless of the source of information, is definitely smaller than in Poland; the figures here are quite clear.
Mmmm.
And, as I said, the main instrument in our discovery and the tax administration, and the view that has prevailed over this period, was the only audit file, and over the last two years, the tax administration has acquired the competences to use the databases to analyse them.
And for example, in the year 2017, four million bills were automatically analyzed, but only 30000 warnings were the result of this analysis process.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed was about five million, which is not too high, but there are more than 350000 warnings.
This led to an impact on income as the first phase of automatic analysis is followed by the warning sent by SMS or email.
So without any official intervention in the tax procedure, etc.
And this system, this first stage, the automatic stage, gives us the results in income, VAT revenues of more than 150 million euros a year.
It concerns the last two years 2017 and 2018.
The increase in revenue took place under the conditions of a good economic situation and improved VAT collection resulting from the broad package of legislative and organisational changes in recent years.
Nevertheless, we believe that one of the main sources of these financial results is the implementation of these single audit files.
The results of the other instrument allowing payment sharing were as follows: in the year 2018, the application of the shared payment mechanism was, as I said, voluntary.
However, we are observing the increased interest in payments in this form.
In July last year, taxpayers made 600, sorry, yes, 600,000 transactions.
More than one and a half million transactions in the shared payment mechanism were carried out in December.
The value of the taxes paid through this shared payment mechanism amounted to half a billion euros in July.
In December 1 and half a billion euros.
Overall, in the period from July to December last year, taxpayers carried out more than seven million transactions using the shared payment mechanism, and the tax on special accounts for VAT amounted to about EUR six billion.
And another information about the activities of the tax administration: Last year, the national tax administration carried out 30% fewer checks than in 2017, but with fewer checks, the percentage of checks that detected irregularities increased.
We believe that this is a result of the introduction of new electronic tools that have helped to identify the company to be properly selected as a control object.
The decline in the number of checks, as I said, was achieved by a higher number, excuse me, the decline in the number of checks was accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical examinations, which obviously are less painful and time-consuming for the taxpayer.
And it resulted in a 100 percent increase in findings last year compared to the year 2017.
In our opinion, in recent years Poland has largely been the time to implement the various laws.
And the overall results are sufficient.
However, we must remember that the economic upheaval has been quite good.
It is therefore difficult to divide the source of these revenues between them.
The results of the new organisational and legislative instruments.
And only the results of the general economy.
That's all.
Thank you for your attention.
If you have any questions, we'll try to answer them...
Do you have any further questions from your side?
If not, I would kindly ask our Romanian colleagues to leave.
Okay, hello.
Can you hear me?
Yes?
