So we would like to continue and I would ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to present the presentation.
OK, here I present our state of affairs.
We have two national laws to introduce European regulation of two directives.
The first law concerns paper and digital publications.
You now have the same rate of taxation,
And under certain circumstances it's zero rate and under other circumstances it's six percent.
For real estate rental, we have adopted a financial activity tax option for the rental of real estate by its nature and a compulsory VAT for short-term rental of real estate.
Then we did two audits,
One of them is most of what we have heard of several times, so I will be very brief.
The second is for an approved cash register system,
And here we also have two new four trends.
Therefore, our audit on most of the matter is neither unfinished,
Not yet published. All conclusions and recommendations are only provisional,
But we are very confident that there will be no major changes.
M m m.
Our conclusions contain very similar comments as we have already heard today, but for us I would just like to point out a few things that are different but which, in my opinion, are more or less specific to Belgium.
Meanwhile, we have limited staff in our administration, because we generally work as a recipient rather than a Member State of identification which transfers money, and we rely very much on the other Member States.
But in the future, when most of the workforce is expanded, we will need more staff and these staff should already be planned and trained.
Another general conclusion that we have made, and which we are already hearing more or less, is that a change in control policy is taking place.
There must be a new attitude, but our administration has strong confidence in other Member States of identification, because we regard the conclusions as Member States of consumption.
Just a leap from one pattern to the other.
We see that there is a very poor control policy, so we believe that each Member State of identification sends or transfers the money.
This is because of us.
However, we have pointed out that it is important to make progress in control policy by creating risk profiles.
So far, our administration has not been able to create good risk profiles because it does not have enough data, but it hopes it will succeed.
I will have more data in the future, and I will make some risk profiles, so we will follow up on this matter if control policy improves.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We're monitoring other taxpayers on the Internet, there's a system to find taxpayers on the Internet, but at the moment the results are rather bad.
We haven't found a lot of taxpayer's stuff.
But we'll see.
As the registration procedure of the Member State of identification, it is fine, but not in the circumstances in which taxpayers are unregistered.
There is no follow-up if they have entered and declared anything in the regular system.
So there is no link or no follow-up system, which we still consider important.
Then we have something to do with the declaration procedure.
There are some automatic checks that we think are very interesting; however, it is not a real check of completeness and accuracy (yes, thank you), but it still helps if frequent mistakes are made.
The actual controls must therefore be carried out by the Member State of consumption, but as a Member State of identification, Belgium continues to help fill in the declaration, i.e. certain errors still exist.
A warning is displayed in the system, or if you have to make a selection, all the options are limited and you can only click on the available selection options so that there are fewer errors.
Average
As a Member State of consumption, we have also found that this is working in the Benelux countries.
With Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, a matrix of certain risks has been created and control activities are now being developed.
With regard to these risks, there are already two test files that have been started for the time being.
We have therefore recommended that we continue to work in this small group in order to make progress and to extend knowledge to European forums.
I think these are the differences that we have gained from this, which we have not heard before.
Let us now proceed with the second audit.
A check for the cash register system has been carried out.
This audit was not carried out by Luden and me, but by other members of the audit unit.
It was also a test that was much more comprehensive than just VAT, but I will only present the conclusions and recommendations that are important for VAT.
The audit concerned the effectiveness and effectiveness of the control policy.
Two problems related to the registry cashier system were examined during installation and application.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations concluded that the Recommendation Regulation is too complex.
It was recommended that the Regulation be simplified because the Regulation and the national rules allow too many derogations.
Because it was very difficult to identify a certain group solely on the basis of the declaration.
Therefore, it was also very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that were to install the cash register system.
Another important conclusion concerns control policy.
There are problems with the choice of the taxpayers of the cash register system.
Since a threshold was set, the threshold has been applied, and if the tax declaration is too low, you fall below the fair threshold and there is no control, so it is a way of escaping tax rules.
There was also a problem with cross-checking of information from the databases to select taxpayers in order to check them.
Another conclusion was that there were also poor internal controls on the application of the system.
It has been found from the fines imposed that different control units have imposed different fines.
So there were no rules on fines, but some control teams were very severe, because the others were not at all severe, or they imposed fines that were far below the rates imposed for certain specific errors, including risk analysis and online access.
It would be an advantage, but it is not implemented now, so the risk analysis was only very elementary and there was no online access, but now we have learned that such a system exists in other countries if they have online access.
They discovered that this could be a very good advantage.
In addition, the exchange of information with the National Social Security Office did not work too well.
So much information was not passed on from one party to the other.
Finally, something about the effects of the system.
There was still a problem when entering transactions
The system as such works very well if it is used in the way it is to be used, but if certain transactions are not entered into the system, they cannot be recognized.
So the solution could be to launch a media campaign for customers in order to ask for a sham.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise, it should not be a fake, but legislation would be adjusted to allow only electronic payments to be accepted, as it would make it easier to track money flows.
However, there is no reliable measurement of the management of impacts, so they have no idea of it.
And then our team did some tests and tried to find some effects, but found that there was a preference effect here, as the introduction of the system was delayed by a few years.
But everyone knew it was supposed to happen, and that's why customers and companies have already anticipated which laws would change and how the system should be introduced.
It was therefore very difficult to identify the exact differences between VAT revenue before 2016, when the system was introduced, and thereafter.
After all, a few years before 2016, VAT returns increased just in view of the new system waiting for it and the consequent changes.
So our team wasn't sure about the result.
This was just about this system, or that the effect was even bigger, because it started earlier than suspected.
Look, may I interrupt now, I have a problem and I want to understand it correctly.
What am I supposed to mean by the term cash register system?
Does this mean that this cash register system is registered somewhere in a database?
No, it's not online, it's a cash, a cash.
Yes, so it's only for cafes, hotels, restaurants.
It's just for a certain branch.
Currently, it is only available in the HoReCa industry (hotels, restaurants and cafes) and it is called a system that should register each transaction or record any extrapolation entered into the system.
There's no online access here.
Therefore, the selection of the control group is very important, as the control teams have to visit different locations.
The control team cannot view the locations online on a computer, but must go to the HoReCas and connect their computer to their registration cash register.
Then it gets the data out and carries out the control.
Yes, but it can't do this from a distance.
The inspection team must always go to the premises itself.
Then and therefore, if a tax declaration is too low and is below the threshold.
The teams will not go there just to see if, for example, they know the cafe and know that there are many customers visiting them and they have not been admitted, but that's just a coincidence.
But they only discovered this later, so they're going to go there.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was worried that I was the only one who didn't understand.
Okay, but what's the difference between this system when you talk about the cash register system at every seller, by saying that in a grocery store.
Then what's the special thing about this particular system that we have?
A special software is available to detect any possibility of fraud with the system, and this software also ensures that the data can be transferred to the computer of the control teams.
By contrast, with a normal cash register system, you cannot extract the data in the same way.
So this is a cash register system that has an advantage.
Average
Yes, there are also other special control tools, I think there are five different brands of cash register systems that you can choose from and which have a certification.
All data that can be extracted in the data formats are suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yes, so the compatibility is certified, that's the other part of the main domain.
Yes, you mentioned this risk analysis, rather, there was a lack of risk service analysis or it had not been carried out at all.
I mean online access to this analysis or
Online access to the registry office itself.
Well, this is what could make checks much easier, and since we could then carry out automatic checks or extract data.
What could be integrated into a larger system and the risk analysis was really only very elementary because there was not enough data available.
This was also due to the fact that this audit or system was not introduced until the year 2016, so that they could only work with data of two years.
Okay, let's finish this.
I have seen two new fraud trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called “marriage”: it was the registration of many foreign companies.
But always through the same two managers, a Russian, a Bulgarian.
But they registered under the names that were very similar to the already known names.
There was only a difference in one letter and only to make it credible that these companies exist, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they made only one VAT declaration and requested VAT refund with false invoices, but they have always submitted this declaration in paper and for very small amounts.
This means that the administration had to enter all the information itself into the system, which took some time.
And so some refunds were already made before the administration could actually find out that there was a possible fraud, and before it could verify whether the company actually existed and whether the invoices were genuine.
But this kind of fraud has been discovered and the information is being disseminated through Eurofisc, so I think that every tax administration is now aware of this kind of fraud.
Another fraud concerned green electricity certificates, which were very similar to former CO3-2 certificates.
This was a scheme more or less in the same sense as they sent the invoices.
Or they use invoices on behalf of a company that very much resembles a legal company that should send the invoice.
So we had a schedule that I very briefly summarized and didn't take a picture of it.
But I want to explain it this way.
It was therefore a company A in one Member State X which wanted to sell these certificates to company C through certificates from company B in another Member State A.
Another company in another Member State Z sends the last company an invoice from an A with accent marking company.
This is also the company with the name, which has only one letter difference from the original.
Consequently, company C cannot recognize that a fraud is actually taking place here.
And of course, it was company A and company A with accent marks that represented the same managers and owned company A, and the A with accent marks company would be the missing dealer.
I hope this kind of scheme is clear.
That was the end of my presentation.
