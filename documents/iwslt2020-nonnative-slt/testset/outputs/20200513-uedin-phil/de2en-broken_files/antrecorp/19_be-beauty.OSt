Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
The name of our company is Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on May 15, 2017, and it was taken over by Mrs. on September 1, 2018.
We buy clothes and suits from the Czech designers or tailor-made studios.
We pay attention to the quality of the materials. Our clothes and suits are made of recycled and natural materials.
We also want to talk about environmental problems in the fashion industry.
The fashion industry is primarily responsible for pollution.
That means we're making over 150 billion garments and another billion garments are being burned or dumped into garbage landfills.
In 2030, the fashion industry will grow as the population increases.
The classic process in the manufacture of clothes is: procurement of materials for... fabrics to make fabrics, weaving fabrics, preparation, which means colours and patterns, and the last step is the sewing and finishing of clothes.
Thank you for your attention. Have a good day.
