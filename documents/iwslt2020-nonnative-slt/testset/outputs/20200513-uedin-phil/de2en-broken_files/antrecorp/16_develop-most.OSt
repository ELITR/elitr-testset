Hi!
I'd like to introduce you to the company I represent.
Develop Most.
Our company was founded this year, but we have already won awards... awards... awards.
So we are facing a rather bright future.
We offer cloud services and Minecraft.
The main focus of cloud services is Office 365.
So the actual provider is Microsoft, we only sell the licenses.
More specifically, we offer three basic licenses for a household, individuals and companies and a large package called E three.
Each option is different in its way, but they contain all basic applications such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint.
And Minecraft has already been mentioned.
An open-world play suitable for all ages.
Perhaps because of its popularity, I don't have to introduce it at all; now there are millions of players worldwide.
It is also important to mention that we offer customized applications.
Depending on customer requirements, we are able to develop applications that fit exactly to it.
If you want to know more, I can give you a business card.
We are pleased to answer your questions at any time.
