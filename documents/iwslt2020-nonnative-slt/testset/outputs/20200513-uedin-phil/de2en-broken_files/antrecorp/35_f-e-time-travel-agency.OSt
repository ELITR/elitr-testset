Good afternoon.
My name is <NAME> and today I introduce you to the practice company Time Travel Agency.
The company has existed since 2014. 2018 our class has taken over it and given it a new image, which is why the company's focus today is more on historical packages.
The team has three leading members and 22 eleventh grade students.
As I said, we combine the magic of the past with modern trends to meet the needs of customers.
Each package we offer our customers has three basic services: transport, accommodation and catering and a number of additional services.
For example, a folklore art workshop, wine tasting, camps for children, riding and archery courses, paintball evenings, meetings and conferences.
As a tribute to the past, Time Travel Agency donates 5% of its revenue to the locks we work with.
You can reach us in many ways, including Facebook, email, Instagram and mail.
We have a website on timetravelsrl.wixsite.com.
Please visit booth number 66.
Take time with the Time Travel Agency.
Thank you for your attention.
