Hello, do we know each other anywhere?
Hello, I think we've met before, maybe we went to the same college a few years ago.
I am, and you?
I'm, what's your job?
Well, I'm the managing director of a small company, Salon NG, an animal hairdresser.
Oh, that sounds very interesting, could you tell me more about it, please?
Yeah, of course.
We are specialized in the care of dogs, cats, horses and rodents.
We offer services such as cutting the claws, cleaning the ears or simply cutting the fur.
But we also offer things like dog beds and cluster, so... animal clothing or just dog food, especially from the Czech Republic, and anti-allergic drugs of a brand from Ontario.
Do you have pets?
We can offer you the highest quality care if you want.
Yeah, I have a dog, I'd like to have his claws cut, they're too long for me.
Could you give me your business card, please?
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot her upstairs, but I'll go get her right away, if you want, you can come with me.
Okay, let's go.
