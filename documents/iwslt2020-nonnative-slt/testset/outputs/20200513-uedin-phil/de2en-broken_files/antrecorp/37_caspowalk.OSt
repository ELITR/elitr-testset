Hello! Hello!
Which floor are you going to?
Hi, in the 15th.
And you?
22.
Do you mind if I take off my shoes?
These high heels are killing me.
Of course.
I don't mind.
Thank you.
Why do you wear these high heels if you could wear sneakers?
I know a really good place selling leisure shoes.
Oh, really?
Yeah, I even work there.
His name is CaspoWalk LTD. and we offer many different shoes of different brands such as Nike, Adidas for all ages and sex.
Do you also offer unique shoes?
Yeah, of course.
I can show you some.
We have a kind of Dutch clog this month as a special offer and if you like sports, you would like the brand new Nike shoes named Nike Adapt BB.
These are smart shoes that you can control with your mobile phone.
You can customize the laces individually, as you can see there, and select a color for the light diodes with a mobile app.
If I bought shoes from you, would you offer me any accessories?
Yeah, of course.
We offer laces and deposits and much more.
Here's my business card.
Why don't you come by at our branch?
Oh, thank you.
You'll find us here in this building, too.
We are taking part in a trade fair for students' companies.
Thank you very much.
We arrived on my floor, so...
It was a pleasure to meet you.
See you later.
Nice to meet you, too.
See you later.
