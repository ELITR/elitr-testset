So, hello, I'd like to introduce you to my company called Jizeran.
We're from Liberec, brewing beer.
It started with a small group of friends who just wanted to brew beer, and after a while we found out that everyone likes it.
We gave it to our friends and they liked it, so we started exporting abroad and brewing in large-scale.
We offer four kinds of beer.
Reichenbeer number ten, Reichenbeer eleven, Reichenbeer thirteen and our dark special beer fifteen.
Our beer is available in cans, bottles, barrels and PET bottles.
And we... our beer is made of hops imported from Å½atec.
I'm glad you've all listened, and if you want to taste our beer, you can visit us at booth number 45.
Thank you.
