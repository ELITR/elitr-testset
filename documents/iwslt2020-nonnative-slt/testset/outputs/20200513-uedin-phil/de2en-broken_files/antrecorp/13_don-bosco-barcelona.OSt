Okay, I'll run the Bosco Hotel.
It is located in Barcelona, in the heart of the city.
You know that Barecelona has many tourist destinations that...
Our service is to help you find and get to these destinations.
So we offer, for example, the service of providing you with a car rental; public transport can be reached from our hotel but also within two minutes.
We also have a gym if you want to train your body or something.
We also have a conference room.
If you are travelling for business, you can make very good business relations there.
We can also offer you an interesting thermal bath and a swimming pool.
So you can also relax in our hotel.
That's basically all about our hotel and our booth has number 105; I'd love you to come by.
I hope you like it and thank you so much for coming.
