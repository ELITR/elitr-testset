I'm tired.
This rail traffic is so exhausting.
I have to sit somewhere.
Did I hear right?
Are you looking for a comfortable chair to sit on and rest?
You're in the right place at the right time, and I'm probably the right man.
Another annoying seller who wants to advertise his product.
Wait, wait... Before you make a hasty conclusion, I'd like to introduce you.
My name is <NAME> and I am the boss of New Design World.
Our company was founded in northeast Italy in 1981 by a group of young people who combined their passion for furniture.
We would like to make our high-quality and refined products accessible to a wide range of users.
Our comfortable chairs, for example, are the right compromise of beauty and elegance.
Oh, interesting.
That sounds like a good proposal.
I was really trying to upgrade my office, so go on.
We want to offer something that focuses on the customer without ever giving up quality, and that is why we want to offer our refined products on the basis of user statements.
And that's why...
Are you interested?
Yes, you convinced me!
Fantastic!
And now that you have planned the foundations of your office, why don't you look at our modern bookshelves and tables?
They are carefully selected, environmentally friendly and completely manufactured in Italy, like all our products.
