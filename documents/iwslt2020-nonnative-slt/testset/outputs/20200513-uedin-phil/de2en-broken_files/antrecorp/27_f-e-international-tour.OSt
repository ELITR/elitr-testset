Hello, my name is <NAME>, like the car, and I am the marketing representative of International Tour, a travel agency that sells and markets tourist deals in Romania and throughout Europe.
We manage to satisfy our customers and our team is the best, in my opinion.
What is there to say; we participate in many competitions
And they will achieve great successes that will help us today.
Last year we had an internship in Italy at that time, and when I make an offer, it is based on my experience.
We have taken a seven-day holiday in Rimini, Italy, at Hotel Kursaal, 3 stars; it is located in... in... near the cliffs and has a private beach, from the rooms you have a side view of the sea. The price is 720 euros for six nights and two people.
In addition, I... on... this trip... I have a flyer with me that contains three... three offers.
One is a stay in Rome, one is a city trip and one is in our city, Bucharest, in our hotel, interbusiness, 4 stars.
Finally, I would like to tell you that our customers receive a 10% discount at this trade fair.
