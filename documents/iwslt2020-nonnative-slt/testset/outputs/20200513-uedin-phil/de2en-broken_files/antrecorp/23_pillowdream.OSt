Oh, that was a hard day!
You're right, very hard!
Do you think it's worth it to be here at the fair?
Yes, of course!
You know, I'm very confident about selling fashionable and trendy products like bed linen and furniture...
People are being made to buy from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are manufactured in Italy: anyone who gives something to high quality knows that.
Yes, you're absolutely right, but don't forget, we're here to get in touch with new customers.
Will we be able to reach these new markets?
Well, you know, our seat is in Veneto, and that's an advantage: we're so close to these markets, Eastern Europe is right around the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will cost a lot of money!
It is foreseeable that they will lose 5% in the first year.
Come on, think positively! These 5% will correspond to our growth in the third year!
And I'm sure we'll gain new customers today.
Yes, you're right.
It's the case that all people have to sleep well.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, comfortable mattresses and warm sheets to sleep?
And everything is handmade by our qualified craftsmen and artists!
It's such a dream!
Yes, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!
