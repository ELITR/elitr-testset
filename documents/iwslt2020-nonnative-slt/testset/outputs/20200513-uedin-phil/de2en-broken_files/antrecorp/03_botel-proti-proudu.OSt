Hello. Hello.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, that's a very nice T-shirt.
What kind of brand is that?
Oh, it's not a brand at all, it's a logo of my botel.
Oh, really?
You got a botel?
Oh, yeah, I did.
It is located in the heart of České Budějovice on the Vlatava River and has three types of rooms.
The first category is called Goldfish, it is the most luxurious room in our botel.
Then comes the second category, Silverfish, and the third category is Bronzefish.
Wow, do you have any special rooms?
Oh, yeah, we did.
We have a special room for lovers, where you can spend your wedding anniversary and stuff like that.
Wow, you also have a restaurant...
Oh, yeah, we did.
We have a restaurant for our guests, which is also open to the public, but our guests eat there for free.
And if you spend more time in our restaurant than you wanted - you know, this can happen - you can use our fitness centre with the latest equipment.
Wow, sorry, I don't like fitness, you have massages and...?
Well, if you are not so keen on fitness, you can visit our relaxation center with massages, sauna, hot stones and so on.
Wow, okay, I like that, great.
And I would like to add that we have free Wi-Fi and free parking for our guests throughout the botel.
Oh, wow, thank you.
I hope you'll come.
I will.
