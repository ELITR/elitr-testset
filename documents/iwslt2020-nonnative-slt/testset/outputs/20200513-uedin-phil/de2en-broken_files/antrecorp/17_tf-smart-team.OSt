Hello, my name is <NAME> and I am the managing director of the smart team at Maria Teiulenu Economic College, Pitesti, Romania.
Our business goal is to provide agro-tourism services in the tourist areas of Romania and to promote the tourist potential to become the best in this area.
After we have analysed the market for winter 2019, we have developed a special offer for you that you cannot resist.
The package is called "Discovery Journey in Draculaland".
It is a fantastic experience in Bran, Poiana Brasov, the city where Dracula was born.
We offer you three incredible days to relax, have fun and explore the surroundings, take photos and collect memories that you will not forget all your life.
Her first day begins with a visit to the famous Bran castle or the "Castle of the Vampire Dracula", a place full of secrets.
Enjoy the second day with your friends or family on a visit to the Dino Park, the only dinosaur theme park in Romania and the largest in Southeast Europe.
Their next goal is to discover one of the most beautiful creations of nature: "The Canyon of The Seven Stairs", which consists of seven waterfalls, the largest of which is 35 meters high.
On the last day you will have plenty of time for our 12 ski slopes, because we offer you a free... free day ski pass.
Is there a better way to finish your holiday than with a special photo session of the Carpathians?
We hope that we have made you curious to learn more about our offers and services; we are looking forward to our booth number 58.
