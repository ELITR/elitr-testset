Ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> I am the director of the fictional company FictionalCine, which runs a cinema, shows films and creates educational programs for schools.
Our company was founded on September 1, 2018 in Mělník.
Our company had five members, but we currently run the company with four people.
Every month we create the new programs and offers for our customers.
As an additional activity, we provide our customers with refreshments.
If you are interested in our educational programs, you can contact us by e-mail fictionalcine at gmail Point com or visit our booth number 55.
We look forward to seeing you.
Thank you.
