Hi!
Hi!
Are you working in a travel agency?
Because I saw your name plate.
Yeah, I work in a travel agency in Venice, her name is Magic Travel.
I'm planning a trip with my girlfriend.
We offer romantic trips, but if you are a rather adventurous couple, we also offer sporty and culinary trips.
We're more like a romantic couple.
We offer travel in Russia, Spain and England.
If you want to look into our catalogue...
Yeah, yeah.
Wow, that's very interesting.
Which would you recommend?
I would recommend Verona because it's the city of love, and I think your girlfriend would feel very comfortable there.
For further information, I will leave you my business card where you can contact us at any time.
But I have to confess that I don't have a girlfriend at all, and I'd like to take you on my romantic journey.
I think I'll see you at the agency again.
