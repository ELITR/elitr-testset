Nice weather outside...
Yeah, it's pretty hot today.
Yeah, I think it's a good day to go out for dinner, don't you think?
Yes, but I don't know with whom; do you know anyone?
I know an amazing Venetian entrepreneur.
Who's that?
He's standing right in front of you.
Seriously?
Yeah, I'll pick you up at eight o'clock.
I didn't say yes.
Not yet. Where am I supposed to pick you up with my Lamborghini?
What do you think?
Just what I said; my Lambo was supplied yesterday by my company from Italy.
So you're in the transport business?
Yes, I have a company in Venice, it's called Idoge; we deliver and ship worldwide.
What's the name of the company?
Idoge; we also sell equipment that can make pasta, for example, Italian pasta.
Oh, that's interesting.
And that's not all: we started in 2016, it's not so long ago, but our customers trust us; we're very well-known for our professionalism, they give us really excellent feedback and outstanding reviews.
And that's why I'm taking you to Mario's restaurant today so you can taste pasta made with our appliances.
Man, you're too confident.
That's because I'm proud of what I'm doing.
So, are you waiting for me at home?
Oh, I'm very pleased to meet you, but I'm already scheduled.
Oh, I'm used to that...
Bye, good luck.
I'm sorry...
