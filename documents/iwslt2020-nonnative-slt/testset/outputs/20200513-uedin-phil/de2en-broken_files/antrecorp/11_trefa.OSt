Hello, ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I represent the company Trefa s.r.o.
We specialise in the sale of confectionery and sweet drinks.
One of our best-selling products is licorice from Morocco from our business partner Mishoc.
You have a very extensive history.
This licorice is one of the best of its kind.
It's long-lasting.
They're selling cookies to us, too.
These cookies are made of 100% chocolate.
We also import from Russia.
Russia is one of our biggest business partners.
They sell us chocolate, they sell us cookies, they sell us candy.
Russian chocolate, even though some don't like it compared to Swiss or Belgian chocolate, is also one of the best in the world.
If you'd like to try something, we've got booth number eight.
You can go there and try whatever you want.
If you want to buy anything, you currently get a 20% discount on everything.
Well, that's all.
I'm glad you listened to me.
Have a good day.
