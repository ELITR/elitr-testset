Excuse me!
Good morning.

I work at the travel agency "Il Gabbiano"; are you interested in any specific holiday offer?
Yes, I would like to travel to a European city, but I don't know which city.
Well, we are working all over Europe and I would recommend you a cold place like Vienna, because I like it; otherwise I would suggest you Barcelona.
Could you tell me how your agency works?
We work in different groups that have their respective responsibilities; they are called Marketing, Front Office and they all work together to prepare holiday offers.
That's fantastic, that's really interesting.
Do you also have a business card so I can call you later for more information?
Yeah, I think...
Yeah, here she is.
That's fantastic.
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.
Bye!
Bye!
