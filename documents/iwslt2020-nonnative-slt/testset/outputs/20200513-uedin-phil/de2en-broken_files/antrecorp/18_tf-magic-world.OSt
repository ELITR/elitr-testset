Hello!
My name is <NAME> and I am the representative of the Magic World team.
The purpose of Magic World is to organize social events, especially for children and teenagers, such as birthday parties, private parties, motto parties.
Our goal is to become one of the most famous companies organizing such events.
Our mission is to turn every simple event into something spectacular.
Over time, the company has diversified its activities to take into account the needs and requirements of our customers.
Today we have a variety of offers for different age categories, such as parties with clowns, fairy tales, cartoon characters, magic and karaokeshows and doll theatres.
We keep pace with the marketing trends so that we organize parties at home, in kindergarten, school or any other place our customer requests.
We offer you an all-round service: facial painting, all kinds of balloons, motto decoration for sinful parties.
Our employees have experience with children and we have been working in this area for a long time.
We find that our company has a business idea that is profitable because it is forward-oriented, has experience; the experienced employees who... do everything with passion and the most important thing is that there is a multi-layered offer based on the needs of our customers.
That's why our motto is "We love to entertain you!"
If you are curious about my team, my employees, my friends and would like to know more about us, please contact our booth 79.
Thank you very much.
