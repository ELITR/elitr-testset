Hello. Hello.
My name is <NAME> and I am from the practice company Folkstyle from <CITY>.
I'd like to tell you a little bit about our company.
Our company Folkstyle comes from Slovakia and focuses on producing clothing and fashion accessories that are decorated with traditional Slovak folklore emotives.
As you know, folklore has a very long tradition in Slovakia and that is why there is still plenty of choice.
It is important to point out that all our products are hand embroidered.
In our wide range you will find hand-made clothes, skirts, belts and also headbands or the currently very popular flies - I'm wearing one of them by the way.
For our production we rely on folklore motifs from different parts of Slovakia.
We try to combine these motifs with the current fashion trends so that in the end timeless garments are created that should not be missing in any wardrobe.
Our products are also available for all ages, young people as well as older people will find us.
If you order our products, do not wait for more than 30 days for your goods.
Payment may be made in cash or by transfer.
