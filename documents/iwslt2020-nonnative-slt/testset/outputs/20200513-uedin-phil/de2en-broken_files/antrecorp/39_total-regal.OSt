Hello, guys, my name is <NAME> and I am the moderator of today's Infomercials, which is presented by the most famous practice company that comes directly from Austria, Total Shelf.
Since 1999, we have acquired the entire market and destroyed the dreams of other companies.
Our managing director has already led this successful organization when some of you hadn't even been born.
Imagine that.
So, where are our branches?
They're obviously in the mountains.
No, just joke, we are actually represented in real cities like Vienna.
What about our dress code?
Short skirts and short leather pants, no, just joke.
But we'll relax our traditional dress code at one of our countless parties to drink a beer or something.
Okay, let's make it two.
So why should you buy our products?
We have been selling our most popular products, which, incidentally, have become quite cult since 1999, that is, for two decades.
And... like, for example, the helping hand, the perfect storage for all kinds of clothes, as well as jackets, or spacewonders, where you can stack shoes and bags.
So, look at our store and how we say in German, "We don't care about your satisfaction."
Thank you!
