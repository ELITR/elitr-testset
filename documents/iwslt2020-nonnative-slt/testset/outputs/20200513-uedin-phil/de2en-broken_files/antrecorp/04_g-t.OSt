So, hello everybody, my name is <NAME> and I would like to introduce the G and T LTD company.
I'm working in the management.
We are from the Czech Republic and are studying at the University of Economics.
The company's headquarters are in Neveklov.
I'm here today to introduce my company.
Our company is a Ltd, but we're not a big company.
Our company has seven employees and three departments.
The first department is the economic department, the second is the financial department and the third is the management.
Now, I'd like to tell you what our company is making.
Our company creates advertising for other companies.
We make stickers for cars, pencils, cups, advertising boards and more.
We also make marketing items.
For example, we make business cards and catalogues.
At the end of my speech, I would like to thank you for your attention and invite you to stand number 47.
Thank you.
