With access to government information, it is a fundamental democratic right.
And this role requires the government to communicate public information.
Society has changed greatly since the law came into force.
And information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
And now virtually everyone is connected to the Internet via a number of devices.
And the 21st century government can respond to these challenges by giving the public direct access to government information.
In other words, the government can actively publish open data.
Then the volume of open data cannot be seen separately from the transition to digital administration.
And here the United Kingdom and the United States set the pace.
You understand that open data is clearly not an objective, but a means to become transparent.
And they are world leaders in the open government partnership.
An initiative to encourage the government to be as open as possible.
There are several European directives and treaties in Europe, which are important for the legislation and policy of open data.
And the Dutch government has open data ambitions and policies.
However, actual implementation is still at an early stage.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former President, Saskia J. Stuiveling, saw the great potential of open data.
And in two thousand thirteen, we decided to monitor the progress of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the status of open data in the Netherlands.
We conducted a survey on the use of the ministries of open data.
Our approach is positive, because we are focusing on ministries that are doing well, and we have tried to encourage the ministries that have fallen behind.
Meetings with experts and officials for open data and publish factsheets showing good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we stressed the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have recognized several potential advantages of open data.
Open data offers the government favourable opportunities.
And by opening up data on its spending and performance, the government gets a better understanding of its own funding.
This shows how Parliament is reviewing the government.
Open data collections would make the government more transparent and accessible to citizens.
From a business perspective, innovative entrepreneurs can convert open data into new applications.
One of our objectives was to determine what the Netherlands could learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Based on data for the biometer with open data from the World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of the open data.
Awareness of securing positive results from open government data initiatives.
The extent to which open data are available.
And the impact on society, the economy, and the government.
Society, Economy and Government
And if we've compared... (Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I can get my voice back to the monitor.
That's very distracting.
Okay. Okay.
But let's go.)
If we compare the United Kingdom and the United States with the Netherlands,
We can see that the United Kingdom and the United States are doing better in terms of implementation and impact.
There are few differences in the readiness for open data.
If we look at the readiness, the Netherlands is not doing so well.
Only with regard to the right of access and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the UK and the United States publish open data far more than the Netherlands.
The number of collections of open data in the USA is enormous.
The type of data that the countries publish depends on the number of points.
The Netherlands is currently publishing only a few open data on public expenditure and public procurement.
Nor is the Dutch Commercial Register open.
As you can see, the United Kingdom has open data on all policy areas.
The impact of open data can be divided into political, social and economic dimensions.
And the Netherlands is lagging behind Britain and the United States in the social and economic dimensions of the shows.
This means that the Netherlands is using less open data to involve citizens in shaping and reviewing government policies.
Companies generate little added value with open data.
In our two reports we have added international examples that can serve as a good example for the Netherlands.
In Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables of waiting times for hospitals.
We didn't just rely on open data scoreboards.
And we did research ourselves, too.
And to get a better picture of the volume and nature of the currently available open data,
we have looked at the data published on our national portal of open data.
A total of three thousand two hundred collections of open data were available in February two thousand fifteen.
And just over half of the data collections are provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by the central government is produced by the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And the Ministry of Public Labour is by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands.
For our two reports, we have asked all the ministries what measures they are taking to publish open data.
The score we assigned to each ministry was based on six indicators.
For example, support for an action plan from the top and by ministerial officials.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have taken exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and how much money they have provided in two thousand fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice had spent neither time nor money on publishing public data.
However, other ministries have commissioned several people to publish open data and have released a cost frame for the activities.
And in the conclusions of two thousand thirteen to fourteen, we came to the conclusion that the open data is a standard but is not yet a practice.
And the open data published there was mainly about the government, and more about what the government knows than what the government is doing.
We have also received a few comments and they rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should give a greater insight into the data available.
It should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third said that the government must invest in both the supply and demand side of open data.
For example, by setting up an Institute for Open Data.
For our two thousand-fifteen report, we noted that the government and the ministries had taken steps to increase the acceptance of open data.
And partly as a response to our first report on open data, the Ministry of the Interior is currently coordinating a government-wide data set analysis.
The Netherlands thus follows the good examples of the United Kingdom and the United States.
There was also a reverse side.
We found that the open data provided via the national portal was unilateral.
Almost all collections of open data are spatial data, geographical data, and almost all are published by a ministry.
There are very few meaningful data available that are important for public control of public finances and government activities.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account in the development of Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch Government should therefore define targets and milestones in a concrete action plan.
And we also think that opening data should be compulsory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
This platform should determine which data should be the most important for society and which data should definitely be open data.
And the government has to use open data itself, for example in social decentralisation.
This is a large national programme in the Netherlands where responsibility is transferred from the central government to the municipalities.
Our reports have had a positive effect.
The Ministry of the Interior will publish the results of a government-wide data collection this month.
And the House of Representatives accepted the request for a national information infrastructure.
On the basis of the data, the Ministry of the Interior will draw up a national agenda for open data.
And in this agenda, they will publish which data will be opened and when it will be opened.
We are also trying to follow an example.
We have published our own expenses on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors spends on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called an open budget.
And the Ministry of Finance has now planned to open up detailed government spending data next year.
Okay. Okay.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is maturing and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor progress.
Thank you for your attention.
And if you are interested, you can find our reports in English and our issue data in Dutch on our website.
