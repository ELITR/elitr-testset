We are from the Czech Republic and we are studying at the Economic Academy.
The company's headquarters are in Neveklov.
I'm here today to introduce my company.

I'd like to tell you what our company is making.

Thank you.
Beautiful weather outside...
Yeah, it's pretty hot today.
Yeah, I think it's a good day to eat, don't you think?
Yes, but I didn't know who; do you know anyone?
I know an amazing Venetian entrepreneur.
Who's that?
He's right in front of you.
Seriously?
Yeah, I'll pick you up at 8:00.
I didn't say yes.
Not yet, where am I supposed to take you with my Lamborghini?
What do you mean?
That is exactly what I said; my Lambo was delivered yesterday by my company from Italy.
So you're in the transport business?
Yes, I have a company in Venice, it's called Idoge; we deliver and send worldwide.
What's the company's name again?
Idoge; we also sell devices that can make pasta, for example Italian pasta.
Oh, that's interesting.
And that's not all: we started 2016, it's not that long ago, but our customers trust us; we're very familiar with our professionalism, they give us really excellent feedback and excellent reviews.
And that's why I'm taking you to Mario's restaurant today, so you can try pasta that was made with our equipment.
Man, you're too self-confident.
It's because I'm proud of what I'm doing.
So, are you waiting for me at home?
Oh, I'm so glad, but I'm already surprised.
Oh, I'm used to...
Bye, all right.
I'm sorry...

Do you mind if I pull out my shoes?
These High Heels are killing me.
Of course I do.
I don't care about that.
Thank you.
Why wear these high heels if you could wear sneakers?
I know a really good store that sells recreational shoes.
Oh, really?
Yeah, I even work there.
His name is CaspoWalk LTD. and we offer many different shoes of different brands like Nike, Adidas for every age and gender.
Do you offer unique shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you what.
We have this month as a special offer a kind of Dutch clogs and if you like sports, you would like the nail-free Nike shoes called Nike Adapt BB.
These are smart shoes that you can control with your phone.
You can customize the cutting angle individually, as you see there, and choose a color for the light diodes with a mobile app.
If I were to buy shoes with you, would you offer me any accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer snowflakes and deposits and much more.
Here's my card.
Come over to our branch.
Oh, thank you.
You'll find us in this building, too.
We're taking part in a fair for school companies.
Thank you so much!
We came to my floor, so...
It's nice to meet you.
See you later.
I was happy too.
See you later.
Good day together, my name is <NAME> and my name is <NAME>.
I would like to introduce you to our company SETA, which is for smartphones, electronics, technological accessories.
We are a company that sells electronic products such as printers, smartphones, watches.
We are also an international company that communicates in French, English, Dutch and German.
We are here at the fair and have special offers for our customers.
One of the sales operations concerns the Instax camera.
If you buy this camera, you will get 100 cards for it.
It is important to note that we only provide dealer discounts for trade, but also quantity discounts for orders from 30 products.
I, um, all our prices include VAT.
Uh, thank you for your time, and I hope to see you at our station, it's number 63.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Hello people, my name is <NAME> and I am the moderator of today's infomercial, presented by the most famous practice company that comes directly from Austria, Total Regal.
We have conquered the whole market since 1999 and destroyed the dreams of other companies.
Our manager has already led this successful organization, as some of you have not even been born.
Imagine that.
So, where are our offices?
They're obviously in the mountains.
No, it's just fun, we're actually represented in the right cities like Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirts and short leather hoses, no, just fun.
But we're already attracting our traditional clothing arrangement to one of our countless parties to drink a beer or something.
Okay, let's do two.
So why should you buy our products?
We've been selling our most popular products that have become really cool next door since 1999, so for two decades.
And... like, for example, the help hand, the perfect storage for all kinds of clothes, as well as jackets, or spacewonder, where you can stack shoes and bags.
So, look at our store and how we say in German, "We don't care about your satisfaction."
Thank you!
﻿We would therefore like to continue and I would ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to present the presentation.
Okay, I'll introduce you to our state of affairs.
We have two national laws to introduce the European regulation of two directives.
The first law deals with paper and digital publications.
You now have the same tax rate,
And under certain circumstances, it's zero, and under other circumstances it's six percent.
For real estate rental we have adopted a financial aid option for renting property of their kind and a mandatory VAT for the short-term rental of property.
Then we did two audits,
One of them is most of what we've heard several times, so I'll be very brief.
The second is for an approved cash register system,
And there are two new four trends.
Therefore our audit of most of the things is not complete,
not yet published. All conclusions and recommendations are only provisional,
But we are very confident that there will be no major changes.
M m.
In our conclusions, there are very similar statements as we have heard today, but for us I would just like to point out a few things that are different, but I think more or less specific to Belgium.
Meanwhile, we only have limited staff in our administration because, in general, we work rather than a recipient than a transferring Member State of identification, and we rely heavily on the other Member States.
But in the future, if most are expanded, we will need more staff and this staff should already be provided and trained.
Another general conclusion that we have made and which we are already hearing more or less is that a change in control policy is being made.
It must be a new way of thinking, but our administration has strong confidence in other Member States in identifying it, because we regard the conclusions as a Member State of consumption.
Just a jump from one pattern to the other.
We see that there is a very bad control policy, so we believe that every Member State of identification sends or transfers the money.
It happens because of us.
However, we have pointed out that it is important to make progress on control policy by creating risk profiles.
So far, our administration has not been able to create a good risk profile as it does not have sufficient data, but it hopes to do so.
I will have more data in the future, and I will make some risk profiles, so we will follow this if the control policy gets better.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We monitor other taxpayers on the Internet, there is a system to find taxpayers over the Internet, but at present the results are worse.
We haven't found many tax matters.
But we'll see.
As the registration procedure of the Member State of identification, it is all right, but not under the circumstances in which the taxpayers are reported.
There are no follow-up measures if they have entered and declared something in the regular system.
So there is no link or follow-up system, which we still think is important.
Then we have something to do with the declaration procedure.
There are some automatic checks that we consider very interesting, but it is not a real check of completeness and accuracy (yes, thank you), but it helps, however, if frequent mistakes are made.
The actual checks must therefore be carried out by the Member State of consumption, but as a Member State of identification, Belgium continues to assist in the fulfilment of the declaration, i.e. certain errors still exist.
A warning is displayed in the system or if you have to make a choice, all options are limited and you can only click on the selected options to make less mistakes.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
As a Member State of consumption, we have also found that this works in the Benelux countries.
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have created a matrix of certain risks and are now developing control activities.
With regard to these risks, there are already two test files that were first launched.
We have therefore recommended that we continue to work in this small group to make progress there and to extend knowledge to European forums.
I think that's the differences we've won from what we've never heard before.
Let's move on with the second audit.
An audit was carried out for the cash register system.
This audit was not carried out by Luden and me, but by other members of the auditorium.
It was also an examination that was much more comprehensive than just VAT, but I will only present the conclusions and recommendations that are important for VAT.
The audit concerned concerned concerned the effectiveness and effectiveness of the control policy.
The installation and application examined two problems related to the registration system.
And the effects of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations concluded that the Recommendation Regulation is too complex.
It was therefore recommended that the Regulation be simplified because the Regulation and the national rules allowed too many exceptions.
Because it was very difficult to determine a particular group solely on the basis of the explanation.
It was therefore also very difficult to monitor or control certain business groups which should install the cash register system.
Another important conclusion is the policy on control.
There are problems with selecting the taxpayers of the cash register system.
Since a threshold has been set, the threshold is applicable, and if the tax declaration is too low, it falls below the fair threshold and there is no control; therefore, it is as if it were a way of doing so.
There was also a problem with cross-checking data from databases for the purpose of selecting taxpayers to check them.
Another conclusion was that there were also bad internal controls for the application of the system.
It was found by the penalties imposed that different control bodies have provided for different penalties.
So there were no rules on penalties, but some control teams were very strict, because the others were not strict at all, or they imposed such penalties, which were far below the rates for certain errors.
It would be a benefit, but it is not implemented now, so the risk analysis was only very elementary and there is no online access, but now we have learned that such a system exists in other countries if they have online access.
They found that this could be a very good advantage.
Moreover, the exchange of information with the National Social Security Office did not work too well.
Therefore, many information was not transmitted to the other party.
Finally, something about the effects of the system.
There was still a problem with the introduction of transactions
So the system as such works very well when it is used as it should be used, but if certain transactions are not entered into the system, they cannot be recognized.
The solution could therefore be to carry out a medical campaign for customers to ask for a disc.
This would therefore ensure that any transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise, it should not be a scheme, but the legislation would be adapted to accept only electronic payments, since it would then be easier to pursue the cash flows.
However, there is no reliable measurement of the management of impacts, so that they have no knowledge of it.
And then our team did some tests and tried to find some effects, but found that there was a preliminary effect here, as the system was delayed for a few years.
But everyone knew that it was going to come, and that is why customers and businesses have already foreseen what laws would change and how the system should be introduced.
It was therefore very difficult to identify and identify the exact differences between VAT revenue before 2016 when the system was introduced.
For a few years before 2016, VAT declarations only increased in view of the expected new system and its changes.
So our team wasn't sure about the result.
This was only about this system or that the effect was even greater because it started earlier than expected.
Look, let me interrupt, I have a problem, and I want to understand it right now.
What do I mean by the term Cash Registration System?
Does this mean that this cash register system is registered somewhere in a database?
No, it's not online, it's a cash, it's a cash.
Yeah, so it's only for cafes, hotels, restaurants.
It's only for a certain branch.
It is currently only available in the HoReCa sector (hotels, restaurants and cafes) and means a system that should register any transaction or register any wedding entered in the system.
There is no online access here.
Therefore, the selection of the control group is very important, as the control teams have to look for different locations.
The control team cannot view the locations online on a computer, but must go to the HoReCas and connect its computer to its registry box.
Then it takes out the data and runs the check.
Yeah, but from the distance it can't do this.
The control team must always go to the premises.
Then and therefore, if a tax declaration is too low and below the threshold.
The teams won't go there just to see if they know the café, for example, and know that many customers are visiting and they haven't been included, but that's just an accident.
But they only found out later, so they'll go.
Thank you very much, Janet, for your question, because I was worried that I was the only one who doesn't understand.
Okay, but what's the difference between this system when you talk about the cash register system for every seller, I mean, in a food business.
So what is the special thing about this special system that we have there?
There is a special software available that determines any possibility of fraud with the system, and this software also ensures that the data can be transmitted to the control team's computer.
On the contrary, using a normal cash register system, you cannot extract the data in the same way.
So this is a cash register system that has a advantage.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
Yes, there are also other special control instruments, I think there are five different brands of cash registry systems that you can choose from and which have a certificate.
All data that can be extracted into the data formats are suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yes, so compatibility is certified, that is the other part of the main domain.
Yes, you mentioned this risk analysis, there was rather a lack of risk service analysis or it was not done at all.
I mean online access to this analysis or
Online access to the register box itself.
Well, this is what could make the controls much easier, and since we could then carry out automatic checks or extract data.
What could be incorporated into a larger system and the risk analysis was really only very elementary because not enough data was available.
This was also due to the fact that this audit or this system was only introduced in June 2016, so that they could only work with data of two years.
All right, let's get this over with.
I have recognized two new fraud strengths within our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called “marriage”: it was the registration of many foreign companies.
But always through the same two managers, a Russian, a Bulgarian.
But they registered under the names that were very similar to the names already known.
There were only differences in one letter and only to make it credible that these companies exist, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they only gave a VAT declaration and applied for VAT refund on false accounts, but they always submitted this statement in paper form and for very small amounts.
This means that the administration had to include all the information itself in the system, which took some time.
And that is why some refunds were already made before the administration could actually determine that there was a possible fraud and before it could verify whether the company actually existed and whether the company actually existed.
But this kind of fraud has been discovered and the information is being disseminated about Eurofisc, so I think that every tax administration now knows about this kind of fraud.
Another fraud involved eco-ROM certificates that were very similar to the previous CO3-2 certificates.
This was a scheme more or less in the same sense as they sent the accounts.
Or they use accounts on behalf of a firm that is very much like a legal firm that should send the bill.
So we had a scheme that I had very short-lived and didn't take a picture of.
But I would like to explain it that way.
So it was a company A in a Member State X that wanted to sell these certificates to company C through certificates from company B in another Member State A.
Again a company in another Member State Z sends the last company an invoice from an A-with-Shareholders company.
This is also the company with the name that has only one letter difference to the original.
Thus, the company C cannot recognize that there is actually a fraud here.
And of course, it was the company A and the company A with shares representing the same business manager and owning the company A, and the A-with-shareholders company would be the missing dealer.
I hope this kind of schema is clear.
That was the end of my presentation.
If you don't mind.
I would like to ask the Polish colleagues to hold the presentation.
Thank you.
And let me just freshen up so I can say a few words about the new regulations, the new instruments that have been introduced last year and this year.
Some of these were presented during our plenary session in Warsaw last year.
So those of you who were present in Warsaw know what they are looking for.
So I would just like to remind you of a few of these, and then I will tell you about our previous examination in this area and our findings.
The first legislation I would like to mention is therefore a single audit concept.
The implementation of this instrument started three years ago.
But last year was the year of the last phase, because the first phase was that the only audit act was the one that had to be submitted to the tax administration on request.
And now this is an automatic system.
And the information must be transmitted electronically without request.
It shall apply from 1 July of the last year.
This is mandatory for all types of business.
And since 2016.
It was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, small and now for all companies.
I will also come back because we regard it as the most important thing in the fight against VAT fraud.
The second legislation I want to emphasise is the so-called 'fuel package', and this legislation has been gradually introduced again.
It depends on the nature of the company, and the idea is that the licence for the fuel trade will be granted only to those companies that are located in Poland, i.e. all Polish branches of foreign companies, which are located in Poland.
The next legislation is the transport package.
I can say that the draft law was based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this kind was introduced in Hungary, but in Poland we have introduced this system of monitoring the transport of goods only for certain types of goods.
In general, the goods subject to excise duties.
I mean fuel, tobacco and some others, and monitoring means monitoring the transport of these goods by public roads or by rail.
This means that each individual transport must be reported before the start of the transport, in a specific system, a specific system, and also, since last year, any transport is connected to the settlement system.
This is how it is possible to verify each individual truck where it is.
About the roads, the parking spaces, etc.
And the Finance Minister for the Ministry of Finance, who analyses the whole system of mass data, is taught by online, one of the public institutions, and as we now know, they can take many results and some irregularities.
And this year we plan to look at the Ministry of Finance.
As the Ministry of Finance is prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is implemented after the mass tax, that all these units must register all transport, and the system is ready for the purposes of the analysis that is being carried out by the Ministry of Finance.
At the moment, however, we do not know whether the Minister of Finance is using this information for tax administration measures.
The next legislation is something similar to what our technical colleague presented yesterday.
So we have a sort of black list, but in Poland the black list means a list of companies that were sent out of the VAT register.
And we have a system that is based on the information that banks and other entities of the financial system are again making available online.
And this system allows the Minister of Finance to identify any irregularities, and the system aims to collect extraordinary transactions and to provide the tax authorities with online information about them.
Based on this information, the tax administration may close the account, the bank account and the transaction.
What is the risk of an amount exceeding EUR 10000?
The next legislation is the payment entered in the last year.
First of all, this is only an option.
In fact, however, it is an option for the buyer.
If part of the contract uses this, the type and manner of payment for the suppliers is of course required.
And what is important is that, if this mechanism is applied to the split payment mechanism, the taxable person's official liability is excluded.
I will show you a few figures on the use of this payment mechanism in a second.
And the last legislative and organisational instrument that our colleague from the Ministry of Finance has presented quite thoroughly last year.
So we have a new national financial and tax administration based on the previous tax administration, and now we get an administration that unites tax and customs administration in a system.
And an online registration system.
Ha ha ha.
At present, we have the mandatory type of cash register system and the mandatory elements of these registration boxes with the electronic storage.
The tax administration can therefore check the registration boxes based on the storage of the authorized type, but we start with the online registration system only for some sectors.
First of all, we run legal services, medical services, fuels and only a few specific sub-areas.
And that means preparing for the establishment of a central system that will be led by the head of national financial management.
In this system, all these transactions should be registered immediately and simply online.
And so we are discussing the question of how to apply the split payments for all sensitive taxpayers.
This means, in fact, that we want the tax administration to replace the conversion of the tax debtor through this shared payment mechanism as well as official liability.
All sectors in which the conversion of the taxable person or the taxable person's liability is binding could be covered by this shared payment mechanism.
And as I said, I want to say a few words about our examination.
We've done the exam last year.
The period covered by the examination was quite long as it was 12 years; we were asked by the Committee on Public Finance of the Polish Parliament to carry out such an examination.
Our results were as follows.
We had to find that the efficiency of the Ministry of Finance's activities during this long period was different in the subperiods of this year.
In the years 2010 to 2015, we believe that the Ministry and the tax administration have made insufficient efforts to improve the efficiency of VAT revenue.
One of the points of view, as the subject of the audit was the supervision of the Ministry of Finance on tax collection or tax revenue, is the VAT levy.
And one of the indicators for the effectiveness of this surveillance is:
Uh, the VAT gap.
In these years, the VAT gap in Poland was on average 24% and was about 10 points above the EU average.
So this was one of the signs for us that supervision was not effectively conducted.
Yeah, here we go.
It can be said that we have information about the VAT gap in Poland and the EU countries, as we have received the figures from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And as you can see, the average European VAT gap, regardless of the source of information, is definitely lower than in Poland; the figures are quite clear here.
Mmmm.
And as I said, the main instrument in our discovery and tax administration, as well as the view that has taken place in this period, was the only audit document, and in the last two years, the tax administration has been competent.
And for example, in J. 2017, four million accounts were analyzed automatically, but only 30000 warnings were the result of this analysis process.
Last year, the number of accounts analysed was about five million, which is not too high, but there are more than 350000 warnings.
This resulted in an impact on income as the first phase of automatic analysis is followed by the warning sent by SMS or email.
So without any official interference in the tax procedure, etc.
And this system, this first stage, the automatic level, gives us the results in income, VAT revenue of more than 150 million euros per year.
It concerns the last two years 2017 and 2018.
The increase in revenue has taken place under the conditions of a good economic situation and improved VAT collection resulting from the broad package of legislative and organisational changes in recent years.
However, we believe that one of the main sources of these financial results is the implementation of this single audit act.
The results of the other instrument allowing the allocation of payments were as follows: in June 2018, the application of the shared payment mechanism, as I said, was voluntary.
However, we note the increased interest in payments in this form.
In July of last year, the taxpayers made 600 apologies, yes, 600000 transactions.
In December, more than half a million transactions were carried out with the shared payment mechanism.
The value of the taxes paid by this payment mechanism in July was half a billion euros.
On December 1 and a half billion Euros.
Overall, over seven million transactions have been carried out by taxpayers during the period July to December of the last year using the mechanism of paid-up and the tax amount on special accounts for VAT was estimated to be VAT.
And so one more information about the activity of tax administration: Last year, the national tax authorities carried out 30 percent less checks than in 2017, but with less checks, the percentage of controls increased, when compared to 2017.
We believe that this is a result of the introduction of new electronic means that have contributed to identifying the company to be properly selected as an object of control.
The decrease in the number of controls, as I said, has been achieved by a higher number, excuse me, the decrease in the number of controls was accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical investigations.
And it led to a 100 percent increase in inventions in the last year compared to J. 2017.
In our view, in the last few years Poland has been largely time for the implementation of the various laws.
And the overall results are sufficient.
However, we must remember that the economic environment was quite good.
It is therefore difficult to allocate the source of these revenue.
The results of the new organisational and legislative instruments.
And only the results of the general economy.
That's all.
Thank you for your attention.
If you have any questions, we will try to answer them...
Do you have any further questions on your side?
If not, I would ask our Romanian colleagues to continue.
Okay, hello.
Can you hear me?
Yes?
In Romania, the nineteen percent of the VAT we have had in the last two years remains.
And although there was a plan to cut it to eighteen percent, it was postponed earlier.
We also have two reduced VAT rates, nine percent and five percent.
And last year, there were some changes to the products that could have the reduced rate.
The biggest change occurred in the wastewater sector, which was reduced from nineteen to nine per cent from the first January of this year.
The others stayed the same.
And at the five percent rate there were a little, a lot of changes, mostly some of the products that were at nine percent were reduced to five percent.
The biggest and the last was from the first of June of this year in terms of quality high quality food, mountain products and equivalent and traditional products.
And for that, the products must be seen on a mountain, or how the cows or sheep live at least half of their lives there.
And the manufacturer must approve a certificate from the Minister for Agriculture.
Thus, it can apply the reduced rate.
Next, we have the reverse tax mechanism.
In Romania, both companies must be registered for application purposes.
There are fourteen products for which the rate can be reduced, and in December 2018 the deadline for some of them was extended to twenty-two.
Finally, we also have the shared VAT system, which was introduced in June 2017, although it now seems a little abandoned by the Ministry of Finance.
Since it started with more than four hundred companies in 2017 and now in 2019 the figure has fallen to sixty-four percent.
As no new companies have used the system since 2018.
That is why all the companies that have started to set up the system and have returned to the normal VAT system.
In addition, the European Commission has allowed Romania to no longer apply this system.
So it looks as if it hadn't achieved its potential, so the Ministry would probably set it up.
All the time?
This is derived from the data we have, I think, because no new companies were registered in J. 2018 and nothing was registered in J. 2019.
So only the companies that started in J. 2017 remain in the system, and their number is slowing down.
In all these findings, there are still some regulatory failures with regard to the MOSS system, which in Romania means, for some reason, M1SS, as it was translated.
But so was it.
And there are also shortcomings in the IT systems in the tax departments that work together and exchange data.
This does not make it easier for companies, and last year they have finally used an electronic machine, a similar machine as in Belgium.
They set up the electronic registers, and the companies are now obliged to use them, as the tax authorities are coming and checking that all the registers have been installed.
But at the moment we are not really sure if the system is fully functional because the IT system has limitations on the part of the Steuerbehörde.
And no new trends have been identified so far.
So that's it.
Thank you very much.
Right, we did this audit.
The audit report is expected to be published on 16 July.
Please treat this information in confidence.
They are available under Embargo until the date of publication.
We are only waiting for the Commission's answers in all 23 official EU languages.
Since we only have the answer in English, this is only a formality and the examination is now over.
The title was "Many of the Challenges ..." and this special report reads "Many of the challenges in collecting VAT on duties still need to be solved".
They still have to be solved.
It was originally ‘still to be treated’, but to some extent they were addressed by new Commission legislation and new proposals, which just mentioned <CENSORED>.
But there are still the problems that need to be solved, and we will see later.
So I start with why we chose this subject for the audit.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
We will complete our recommendations.
First of all, we conducted a survey as we follow the previous research analysis.
Based on the findings of the chair of this post in the field of e-commerce, there were some audits by German colleagues and Lithuanian colleagues.
In a report on imports previously identified, we analysed the problem of the removal of non-EU countries and the problems associated with them in terms of VAT and duties and decided that it would be worth it during this review.
The problem is that honest traders are often excluded from the market by unfair traders and cannot compete anymore.
This is a problem that has also been addressed by a scientist such as Professor Rita de la Feria and which is particularly intense in the UK.
Estimates of losses too.
There are only estimates of the distance from non-EU countries.
These estimates are not very encouraging, however, as the Commission has only proposed five billion a year, but in the UK there are between one and a half billion pounds a year.
You've estimated these losses.
This corresponds to between 8% and 10% of the UK VAT reduction.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently accounts for only four percent.
So we have the triple amount of fraud in the UK, which represents the loss of electronic trade in goods purchased from non-EU countries.
So that's an order.
We do not count on intra-EU TV sales, we do not count on most electronic services here.
So this is about expressing our concerns.
Then, of course, we look at five Member States – Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we have most often taken into account the number of registrations in MOS in both non-EU and US systems.
The volume of intra-EU e-commerce sales and, ultimately, the estimated amount of VAT that is due to the low value of Simon's release.
After examining our source by the Commission, we have also visited the Commission.
These actions should debug the technology and the World Customs Organization, and the period of time spent ranged from 2,500 to the end of 2,000 eighteen.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal submitted and all the proposals that will enter into force in 2021.
What are we talking about?
Of course, we have begun to analyse the answers to our survey sent by the second core group.
We continue with the questionnaire in all the Member States that we have visited with interviews with all possible people.
We have received access, and this is also very important, to have set up an ABC data access to the synergy database, the database with incidents and problems reporting the data from the Member States in the MOS.
We have access to all fiscal project groups and electronic groups on e-commerce and all related project groups, so that there is a lot of information and discussions on the functioning of the MOS system.
And of course, we have received funding from the institutions of Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally we have carried out our own samples of various transactions.
Overall, we have examined almost nine hundred transactions in connection with e-commerce.
What we find here, of course, are the first positive things and then we will continue to work with the most negative things.
The legal framework follows the international best practices of the OECD and the World Customs Organization, which show extremes.
In most aspects of the OECD, the principle of taxation at a destination has been respected in the majority.
There is now a new threshold of less than ten thousand euros that you can report to the home Member State, which does not comply with the OECD rules.
For the World Customs Organization dealing with the imported packages, the directives on immediate release have been followed in most respects, and this also applies to the new proposal for the standard framework.
The Commission adopts this proposal as a priority and agrees in many respects with the World Customs Organization and with the standards.
For the new regulation to be introduced in 2021...
I intend to address some of the weaknesses, but for us the main problem that will continue to arise is underevaluation.
We are experiencing losses from VAT and duties and will thus continue to do so.
This cannot be done by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As far as trade with non-EU countries is concerned, this will not be resolved and we will see why later.
Why, yes, because administrative cooperation with non-EU countries does not work?
We have a new agreement with Norway.
We expect an intact exchange of information with Norway, but that is not a problem.
It is not Norway, the problem is China, it is the United States.
The information chain with China is not working because the Chinese side is not responding and the percentage of responses is still falling, so that makes a real problem.
If we have information about the supplier exchange that does not work via an electronic interface, i.e. he works directly on his website, which is mostly not registered or even registered, and then we cancel the registration, and then we cancel the registration.
What is it like to pay the VAT from Europe to China, and we expect VAT to be reimbursed to the EU.
If we do not have administrative cooperation.
This will never happen.
This is also a problem between the EU countries where it does not work as expected.
Administrative cooperation, as we will see later, and the checks carried out by the national tax authorities are also weak.
Therefore, there are practically no instruments to carry out a proper risk analysis of an opportunity, as has already been mentioned.
It is also necessary for the Member State to agree with the Commission's proposal to exchange information with payment service providers, while payment service providers controlled by the Commission are not sufficient.
And we will see later that the Commission had not carried out any monitoring, no monitoring.
There are also difficulties in the customer-specific electronic customs processing systems.
The traditional problem is, of course, that traders underestimate the goods so that prices are below the two, twenty or ten-year threshold for VAT.
And this will fall away in the future, but they will continue to underestimate the goods in order to pay less VAT.
It is not accepted, but they will pay less, and with regard to customs duties, the adoption is set at EUR 100.50 and cannot be achieved.
Thanks to all the electronic support we can look forward to an EU electronic customs clearance system that does not stop the customs declarations.
If an e-customs office is affixed to the relevant field, he/she shall electronically apply for the exemption of customs duties for the customer.
And it will be better to apply the system even if a value is declared that is more than fifty-one.
The electronic system cannot stop them from saying that, and that is something very serious, because the operators that work there are hopeful economic participants.
So, the great couriers, they have an authority for economic operators and they propose to be the most reliable, but they abuse the system.
A compulsory levy of VAT and customs duties is not effective.
O.K., the provisions for the information chain on claims relating to this tax.
They are rarely used by the five Member States we have visited in Austria.
Only on five occasions, so they are not often used.
There are inconsistencies in the payments between the Member States we have analysed.
We have access to the vote held by the Commission and there are still no meetings.
Much is important between Member States.
There is obviously a problem in the Netherlands that they are not in a position to bring the VAT amounts received into line with VAT declarations.
And there are also problems with the payment certificates that our fellow Members of the NKU discussed yesterday.
They alleged a problem with the payment certificates from Member States of consumption that were not processed.
Here is the summary of our findings on the MOS sample.
We have come to the conclusion that the MOS IT infrastructure is suitable for its purposes and is so strong.
The user can handle this, so the IT infrastructure is strong, but there are problems with registration and payments between Member States.
For example, we analysed the incidence reported in the synergy database between Member States, but in the five Member States there are only a few 22 cases.
We then examined in which Member State the problem has already arisen and how the Member State is affected.
There were only twelve cases, so not too many cases, but the problem is that the attitude of the Member States was really passive.
Only when the problems escalated, they began to work on it, but it took a long time until the problems were resolved.
As far as MOS is concerned, it takes away long periods, but there are not many problems.
In the case of technical errors sent and received between the Member States, responsibility is very passive and not proactive until the problem is extended as an incident, they begin to react.
But the infrastructure is robust for the MOS.
We haven't checked if they're ready for the only plant.
This is another thing that we have received some complaints, particularly from Austria.
They say they are not ready, even from the Dutch path that we have not analysed, because the system is specifically developed for customer-specific purposes by using only one plant for import.
There is a problem with registration here.
We need to distinguish between the non-US system and the EU system, where only eighty percent of registration applications have not been properly checked.
As far as the knowledge of the non-US system is concerned, we have even identified cases of double registration, which is something of a disadvantage, then the problem of the Member State's deficiencies in payments is, in particular, the problem of the Member State's deficiencies.
And sometimes also in the Member State of identification.
Further problems with registration and cancellation of registration.
This concerns in particular administrative cooperation, i.e. the exchange of information between the Member States we visited.
And if we compare the overall activity of the information networks here, we can see that, for example, the total need for information sent for one hundred and twenty-two is compared to the total need for information.
Not related to the average in general are ninety-two thousand, so that not even many in the UK are even more problematic, for example three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is sometimes good, sometimes very low, some Member States have not changed anything and there is no reason to do so; we recommend having a separate, centralised CNO Home Office.
A tight structure that is determined by the IT business or at least by the MOS, so that the level of information transmission is very weak.
Then we have the multilateral controls, there were six cases of multilateral controls in two cases.
That was a really successful experience.
In two cases, however, this was not at all successful, as the Member State of identification refused to participate in multilateral control.
This is intended to be resolved through the implementation of the new legislation, as two Member States can now request the implementation of a control.
And then there is another recent challenge to the other Member State of identification that it should not refuse participation.
Hopefully we will see improvement, but there are other things that are important for Eurofisc.
There were forty-four signals to Eurofisc that a chain is full of e-commerce trade, and only a feedback to these forty-four signals.
So the Member State did not find this information very useful, they do not know why they were selected, since only five Member States have included the seniors in the database.
And the others didn't read it because they didn't find the information very useful.
There is also a signal formation on fraud issues, three or four issues which they considered useful.
And then there are various tools of a self-employed web-crawler tool, but this is something that only some members in their countries use legally.
In other Member States, domestic legislation prevents the use of web crawling tools.
This is why the work files are frozen and the frozen activities are no longer useful.
They are awaiting the proposal of the information chain between payment service providers.
That's why they want to have a database and access it.
This is the Commission's proposal on all information supplied by the payment service provider from other countries.
Of course, we support the proposal very much and add it to the report, but I did not know that the Commission itself needs support for this proposal, because now that I have not asked for it yesterday, Lubik Lubis said that
In the Council, however, I am of course in favour of this proposal, because it comes from a number of discussions in some forums with Member States and with stakeholders.
Hopefully this is very important, because there is another problem: the lack of controls and audits for MOS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here, there's no reason for that, because I can't do anything like that if I don't know, I don't have a regional analysis.
So my audit will be based on a random selection and will probably contain a lot of information and no records, because some data is needed, and this is the data.
In addition, the company will need a lot more applications.
Yes, it's Germany, they understand it because we have the data.
Not an American team, but the information might be available to him.
A phenomenon.
But I don't know, and still, there's practically no control.
The inspections of knowledge of distance within the EU were also not very successful.
That is why we have at customs the results of the sample per courier from the postal use.
In order to address the question of undervaluation, the main problem in the post offices, they have very expensive drones here, which have been declared under ten units or at twenty-two euros.
Try them a thousand times easier.
And they can read and it's very difficult to create this at the level of a post office.
And for the couriers it is easy to abuse the duty exemption of fifty-one, because they simply tighten the box for the takeover and then don't close the fifty.
In order to stop the explanation, although the depreciation is more than fifty-one, we will not only check this in the sample, but also directly in the electronic customs system in the dampened environment where we have made some attempts.
It has not worked in any Member State, it only works in Austria.
However, it was not accepted in Austria.
We have introduced another explanation for alcohol.
And then it was applied to alcohol, and because this category is applicable to alcoholic products.
There are also some errors in the Austrian system.
Another problem is that the approved economic operators and the most reliable customs dealers abuse the system.
Then we have a recommendation for the Commission to take advantage of the structures provided for in the Treaties on mutual assistance with non-EU countries.
In order to address the problems, a lack of answers must be identified.
To carry out inspections in the Member States relating to local reductions.
Monitoring the functioning of telecommunications within the EU, the minimum, the only operator; this recommendation is the only one not accepted by the Commission.
That's why you succeeded yesterday because you're still on duty.
The Commission is monitoring and <CENSORED 22:25> said, "Yes, yes."
I did it, but OK.
They support Member States in the development of a methodology for estimating the VAT gap in newcomers.
Since this is a problem, we cannot know whether or not the system works.
It is assumed that the system is mostly successful, but this is usually an acceptance, and that is why we have an estimation of most VAT gaps.
We do not know for sure whether the system is successful, and for EU internal trade itself we do not have an estimate, so that would be very important.
What the Commission supports in the development of the Member States is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative technology solutions.
In order to combat VAT fraud, an alternative system of shared payments could be supported under circumstances.
Using block chain technology, new paths are proposed, the KPMG and also Professor E. Ensworth's proposal.
There are very interesting proposals, of course, which we have discussed with the Commission, and the Commission says that they are theoretically and practically capable of finding solutions.
In reality, they have not found any practical application, yet Professor Lamas has made some proposals for the use of technology for imports from non-EU countries.
But this system is accepted by many other countries.
There is no practical experience, but I think we also think it is worth getting deeper into the possibilities of block chain technology.
This is also examined by the Commission for the management of the database of the main single operators.
Numbers to maintain the validity of these numbers of the only establishments.
It is very important that the Member States use the new technologies, because only so can they catch the fleet for the future.
Of course, we are pleased that they have begun to respond to the fraud of the elderly and to rebuild the euro.
Please also monitor the compensation corresponding to the new threshold of ten thousand euros.
This is something the Czech colleagues highlighted in their report.
And we took it up, also for the reason they explained it before.
In order to have a separate MOS and Remote Coordination function in colleagues, we must ensure that the dealer only has the VAT rate, the correct VAT rate in the MOS VAT rebate.
If the trader introduces a false VAT rate, he only receives a notification, but the explanation can still be sent, so he gets a warning, but the explanation will be given anyway.
Please also carry out the necessary checks when entering the registration application into the MOS to avoid the problem of double registration.
Increase the audit activity of most MOS traders and broadcasters using administrative cooperation tools.
An employee of the regular estimates of VAT compliance for e-commerce.
We would therefore be very grateful if you could remind the Member States of this recommendation in your home country.
That is why we ask you to cooperate in this matter and to serve you with everything we know when you have questions.
Mr Mayrbeurle, the floor is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for the invitation.
It's an honor to be here to talk to you.
My theme is to give you a brief overview of our mass data instrument, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
Before I really start, I want to give you a overview of the largest Austrian municipalities.
You can see the municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, and from 2,000 to 11 we are entitled to audit all these municipalities.
The threshold was twenty thousand before.
So the gray dots have more than twenty thousand inhabitants and the blue have less than twenty thousand.
The explanations are still in German.
I'm sorry.
In total, we are therefore entitled to examine 75 municipalities.
These are about three points and two percent of the total amount.
But we advise all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, we in our department have decided to develop a special tool, which we call a community monitoring tool.
The development team in our department consists of three young economies, and I am one of them.
And we three all use the instrument for different purposes.
What was the purpose of this instrument?
The main reason was to find an analytical tool for the financial risk assessment.
So first, we're trying to create a profile for every community.
We take into account all relevant factors.
In the second step, we are evaluating the communities as to their importance for the audit activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we classify the municipalities according to certain indicators according to the financial risk.
Appointment is always the interesting method, the most interesting part of all history, because we can compare all communities.
Thank you.
The biggest challenge for each database project is to collect data of good quality.
We've heard it before the day.
In this context, we would like to use the data of the Federal Statistical Office Austria, the Austrian Statistical Agency, which represents our main partner in this project.
And we get the following data...
Where these data are actually open to every citizen
But you have to buy it from Statistics Austria if you want the aggregated data.
And only aggregated data are useful for analysis.
So we have the inter-sector accounts according to the budget and the accounting rules.
We have detailed information about the closed accounts so that we have the accounts at the free-card level.
And we have exposures of debts and liabilities.
We mainly use financial and accounting data, but of course we have securities settlement systems data separately. We have population figures and other data derived from Austria's statistics.
What we have is the data from the time of two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen.
Oh, that's a mistake. Excuse me.
And we keep updating this data every fall.
Since we take the data from the accounting systems of the municipalities, we do not have data on community contributions, no data on leasing obligations and no data on sales and assets, as the municipalities do not perform this data.
This is an important point, since in practice, if you go to the community and agree with the official accountant, you will find the number of debts, and if you pursue the body or community contributions, you can do so.
Based on the data available, we assume that our indicators of good distribution, which I will explain later on, can develop an indicator model, and this monitoring is based on a model that consists of indicators.
And there's a statistic going on between one and a hundred that's going to be relevant to the next test.
This model therefore allows the use of indicators by specific themes.
In order to establish the relevance of the audit, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses the indicators for the financial situation as a basis, but depending on the question raised and the question to be examined, another indicator may be used.
And then you get another result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four themes, and the first is the long-term financial situation.
In other words, we assume the net debt in addition to the liabilities with respect to securities and reserves.
So the first one gives us the long-term perspective, i.e. debts against assets.
And the second issue is the short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we define the core ldo, i.e. the current revenue without transfers in respect of current expenditure without transfers and pensions.
This is an important point in the indicator model, as we do not apply the figures I have expressed per head.
We apply a different number, and this is the actual income as a relevant number, as it is better able to show the economic power of the community.
The next item is the administrative structure.
Because we're just putting together the administrative and personnel costs.
The last one was the biggest challenge for us.
We have tried to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And yes, we take into account other accounts, the other accounts, the representation costs and the analysis of special accounts.
That means we're trying to find accounting errors with these data.
This slide is a screenshot of a possible release of the monitoring tool
And you can see the listed communities from the best to the worst community.
The black column gives us the value and refers to the importance of the audit activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors, and it is therefore classified in this picture according to the relevance of the audit for our department.
So the four columns on the right give us the indicators.
I explained the indicators of the model earlier.
And the black column gives us the value of three and thirty commas, which is the municipality of Hallwang, a small community near Salzburg, and this is the best community.
That means it's a judgment.
So if we want to look at a community with the best financial situation, we'll look at Hallwang.
If we like to test the worst, we just jump over the picture and take the last one, but today I don't want to show you these communities.
And we have all the Austrian congregations in our system, but not every community falls under our jurisdiction, so that only the second, yes the second, can be audited by us.
And we're trying to compare the municipalities with the same size, so we don't compare Vienna with Hallwang, so we're looking for similar communities, so it's a fair comparison.
So we have many different representation possibilities of the search results of this instrument, and another feature is this diary for each community.
Here we have, for example, the municipality of Hallwang.
We can create such a diary for each municipality of Austria, and as you can see, you will probably not be able to read it, but we have a lot of numbers, indicators, graphs and information.
Another feature of the diary is these two pages. For example, you can see the analysis of personal tasks on the left, this is the red line of the diagram.
And compared to the other municipalities, you can choose the blue line and where the red line exceeds the blue line, the municipality is worse.
Or
So you can easily assess whether the municipality has excessive spending.
So on the right hand side, we have the references, which means that we have the outgoing and the detailed money in a community perspective.
These two expenditure, however, are only two of many.
We are now using some statistical programs like R Stat Plus and are able to perform any analysis that is necessary or required by our predefined.
As you can see, we use this tool for audit planning, for preparing, for the operational level and on request, i.e. if anyone is only allowed to attend a presentation in the municipal administration, he/she/she/she can
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in a region, we can do this, and this information does not only help us in the examination itself.
And in accordance with our advisory approach, we provide the community with the specific Fact Sheets.
In other words, if the mayor wants to call us and know what his municipality looks like and what the financial situation in this community is like, we can give him a Fact Sheet and a diary.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
Marcus, are you online, can you hear us?
Should I start?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Ha ha ha ha, sorry.
First of all, thank you for inviting me to speak at your e-data conference.
Access to government information is a democratic fundamental right.
And this role requires the government to provide public information.
Since the entry into force of the law, society has changed very much.
And information is no longer stored on the paper, but stored in dynamic computer systems.
And now virtually everyone is connected to the Internet via a number of devices.
And the 21st-century government can respond to these challenges by providing direct access to government information to the public.
In other words, the government can actively publish open data.
The volume of open data cannot be seen separately from the transition to digital administration.
And here the United Kingdom and the United States present the pace.
They understand that the open data is clearly not an objective, but a means of becoming transparent.
And in the open government partnership, they are global leaders.
An initiative to encourage the government to be as open as possible.
There are several European directives and treaties in Europe, which are important for the legislation and policy of open data.
And the Dutch government has open data ambitions and policies.
However, the actual implementation is still at the beginning of an early stage.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former President, Saskia J. Stuiveling, saw the great potential for open data.
And in two thousand thirteen we have decided to monitor the progress of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We conducted a survey of the use of open data ministries.
Our approach is positive, because we are referring to ministries that cut off well, and we have tried to encourage the ministries that have fallen behind.
Through meetings with experts and officials for open data and through the publication of fact sheets with good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we stressed the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have recognised several potential benefits from open data.
Open data provide the government with good opportunities.
And by opening up data about their spending and services, the government gets a better understanding of its own funding.
In this way it shows how Parliament is reviewing the government.
For citizens, the collections of open data would make the government more transparent and accessible.
From a business point of view, innovative entrepreneurs can use open data in new applications.
One of our objectives was to determine what the Netherlands can learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Using data for the biometer with open data from the World Web Foundation, we compare three aspects of open data.
The awareness to ensure positive results from open government data initiatives.
The extent to which open data are available.
And the impact on society, economy and government.
Society, Economy and Government
And if we have compared...
I'm sorry.
I'll get my voice back to the monitor.
That's very disgusting.
O.K.
But let's go on.)
If we compare the United Kingdom and the United States with the Netherlands,
We can see that the United Kingdom and the United States are cutting down better with regard to implementation and impact.
There are hardly any differences in the availability of open data.
If we look at the readiness, the Netherlands is less good at cutting off.
Only with regard to the right of information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the UK and the United States publish open data much more than the Netherlands.
The number of open data collections in the United States is enormous.
The type of data published by the countries depends on the number of points.
The Netherlands is currently publishing only a few open data on public expenditure and public procurement.
The Dutch trade register is also not open.
As you can see, the United Kingdom has open data on all policy areas.
The impact of open data can be divided into political, social and economic dimensions.
And the Netherlands remains in the social and economic dimensions of the shows behind the UK and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in the design and review of government policy.
Companies generate only little added value with open data.
In our two reports, we have added international examples that can serve as a good example for the Netherlands.
In Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on waiting times for hospitals.
We didn't just leave on open data barometers.
And we've been looking for ourselves.
And to get a better picture of the volume and the type of open data currently available,
we have seen the data published on our national open data portal.
A total of 3,000,200 collections of open data were available in February for 2,000 and 15,000.
And something more than half of the data collection is provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by the central government is produced by the Ministry of Infrastructure.
The Ministry of Public Works is the main source of open data in the Netherlands.
For our two reports, we have asked all the ministries what measures they are taking to publish open data.
The number of points we assigned to each ministry was based on six indicators.
For example, support for an action plan from the top and by persons of the Ministry.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have taken extraordinary initiatives to publish open data.
We have also asked the ministries how many people and how much money they have provided in two thousand fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice had neither spent time nor money on publishing public data.
However, other ministries have entrusted several persons with the publication of open data and have provided a cost framework for the activities.
And in the conclusions of two thousand thirteen to fourteen, we came to the conclusion that the open data represent a standard but are not yet practical.
And the open data that was collected there are mainly about the government, and rather what the government knows than what the government does.
We have also received a few comments and they rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should provide a greater insight into the available data.
It should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third said that the government must invest both in the supply and demand side of open data.
For example, through the establishment of an open data institution.
For our report of 2,500, we found that the government and the ministries had taken steps to increase the acceptance of open data.
In part, in response to our first report on open data, the Ministry of the Interior is currently coordinating a government-wide data set analysis.
The Netherlands therefore follows the good examples of the United Kingdom and the United States.
There was also a turning point for days.
We found that the open data provided via the national portal was unique.
Almost all collections of open data are geodata, geographic data, and almost all are published by a Ministry.
There are only very few important data available that are important for public control of public finances and government activities.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following should be taken into account in the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch Government should therefore define objectives and milestones in a specific action plan.
And we also think that opening data should be mandatory.
And the government should build a national information infrastructure.
This platform should determine which data are of the greatest social importance and which data should be open in any event.
And the government has to use open data itself, for example when it comes to decentralization in the social field.
This is a major national programme in the Netherlands, in which the responsibility of the central government is transferred to the municipalities.
Our reports were positive.
The Ministry of the Interior will publish the results of a government-wide data collection this month.
And the House of Representatives accepted the request for a national information infrastructure.
On the basis of the data file, the Ministry of the Interior will establish a national agenda for open data.
And in this agenda they will publish what data will be opened and when they will be opened.
We are also trying to set an example.
We have published our own expenditures on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors spends its money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open budget.
And the Ministry of Finance has now planned to open up detailed government spending data next year.
O.K.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is increasing and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to make progress.
Thank you for your attention.
And if you are interested, you will find our reports in English and our expenditure data in Dutch on our website.

So wherever we see a t, we substitute
Because that's the same thing as t.
So we can write this blue equation as the length of the
bottom width is 2 times the length of the top width
But we know that t m12
But to make it easier
Let's split it up differently and count the clamps out
2 times m is 2m
2 times 12 is 1.
And then again minus 12.
or we could write this down so that b 2m
minus 32
ok
1 is 22 iminus is still 12
So now we have all expressed depending on m and we can now
So for the top width t let's substitute t
So we have m12 plus m.
plus the length of the bottom width
But that's what we've already expressed in my
just now
This is the length of the lower width expressed in m
So instead of b, we write 2m32.
plus 2m minus 32 is 12.
All we've done is subscribe for t.
we have expressed t depending on m and b also
so now we combine the m equation and the constant term so that
we only have one m here and one m there and
then another 2m there
So all m is positive.
1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4.
So we have 4m.
So what does the constant equation tell us?
we have a negative 12 and then we have a negative 32.
So 12 minus 32 is 42 or so
So we have 4m 2.
And the equation says these 4 times 2 is equal to 12.
So we isolate m on one side of the
Let's count 2 times 2 to both sides to get rid of these 2.
So we add 2 to both sides of the equation.
then stay left only 4,000 left, the two of them up here.
Now we divide both sides by 4 and then we get m is equal to 14 by 4.
Or we could say 72 feet because we're counting
So we have the equation for m solved now
missing t and b
So let's do this.
Let's solve it.
t is m minus 12
So t is equal to our m is 72 minus 12 that's the same thing as
62 or 3 feet
everything is expressed in foot about it we know that
Okay, so the top width t is 3 feet long.
the average is 72 feet which is the same as
And then the bottom breadth twice as big as that
What do we do the same thing?
We're going to put it equal to 2 times 3 feet because that's the
length of the top width and minus 12 that is
And we're done.
you can still check if the lengths together are 12
So 5 12 plus 3 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12.
the upper breadth is a half foot shorter than the middle breadth
And the lower breadth is a half foot shorter than 2
And we're done.
we know the length of the bretter the
fill all numbers in the table
and writes 430 to five different species
Let's think about how we do this.
this 4 means 4 hundred
this 4 means 4 hundred
And 3 is at the decimal place, so 3 is ten.
4 hundred and three tenths are the
But we can do a few things.
For example, we could only do three hundred
We took 1 hundred of the hundred.
And they could give it to the tenth place,
If you take the 100 and give it to the decimal place
100 are 10 tens.
So you have 10 tens and 3 tens were already there.
So it makes 13 tens there.
If it's a little confusing
Remember this is 430
This is 300 plus 130.
That's still 430.
So you could view this as 200 plus 230.
230 is the same as 23 tens.
You could see this as 100 plus 330.
33 tens are 330
And finally, you could see it as 0 hundred plus 43 tens.
43 tens are 430
welcome let us talk about the web
the matter they are currently using
the web is this fast network of connected computers
and from 2014 there are probably more than
one billion websites a billion
When I was a kid, we only had a million.
And we thought we were cool.
what we do websites for
to share websites used at the beginning of the researcher
their research as on high-energy accelerators
But now everyone's using it for pretty much everything.
Maybe they're using a social network to talk to their family.
a photo website for the exchange of photos
their skins and cuts thereof,
a travel website to decide where to go on an exotic trip
or a news website to find out
What is going on in the world
and of course they must use
learn the khan academy website
So what's their love website?
Actually, I have a better question.
which website they want to exist but not yet
maybe a website about itself
Or something they love
the cool thing is you can program a website yourself
And they can learn how to do it here at khan academy.
start them brainstorming what they want to do
For they will be in the lowest place, doing it early enough.
let us first make sure a little bit and disable some concepts
what is the web exactly
Now as I said it's a bundle of
connected computers that have pages
if a computer is connected to the internet
and spurred a website out we call that computer a server
because they serve on the website of the
a website is written in three languages
html to mark web content
css for the styling it
and javascript to make it interactive
how users like they actually see these websites
now they use an app dedicated to websitebrowsing
like chrome firefox or internet explorer
and we call these applications browser
browsers try to show everything elbe website in the same way
But they have their differences because
we sometimes say hoppla there is a problem with this browser
try another
which browser they are using right now
Now they have to be with that browser
Of a kind of device like a laptop
smartphone tablet or also a smartphone
and we call these devices customers
customers can be quite different
Some are smaller than others
some have touchscreens others have keyboards
Some are black and white
So websites have to try to work well
in all types of clients
which client they are currently using
And this is the way
Now the two-minute session
It's about learning a lot more about the road.
But now I think it's time to start writing them
some html and css make them their own websites
Paragraph 109
if we write 109
then it's literally 109 percent and that's the same thing as
109 per cent and now I could write again, but that
we already had
So it literally means
109 per 100
If it were 100 per 100 then we would have it all but
Now it's more than a whole
we have 109 per 100
We can write that as a relationship or a break
That's the same thing as 109 per 100.
It's the same as 109100.
So let's do this.
So here we have a whole
this square is a whole
in the last video we have counted
That's a 10x10square.
it is divided into 100 pieces
So if we want 109 of this piece
What does that mean?
It means that we all
Take 100 pieces here
I'll take a new color.
So we're going to screw this up.
If we only punish these, we have 100.
100 or 100 per 100 or 100
I think you know what I want to do.
I just want you to understand.
that really means only 100 out of 100 or from a whole
And as we can see, this is the whole square.
That's exactly 100 out of 100.
now we should delete 109
we already have 100 per 100 missing 9
So let's multiply 9.
So let's go, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
eight nine
So this piece here has what we see.
exactly
That's 9 of a whole square.
this is 100 of a whole square.
When we angle this whole square and the blue pieces over there
over here, we'll see 109 of one.
Quadratic geese
I hope that made sense.
start with a few tasks
1 task which is 15 percent of 40
I solve percentage data by
Convert the percentage to a decimal number and then multiply by the number
Of which I want the percentage
So 15 is equal to 015.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
And then we multiply this number by 40.
So 40 times 015.
5 times 0 0
5 times 4 20
Place a 0 here
1 times 0 0
1 times 4 4
equals 6 0 0
And they are numbered of them.
one two
no decimals here that equals one two
And the same place is coming here.
So 15 of 40 is the same thing as 015 times 40 and that's 600.
And 600 is equal to 6.
Now the next task
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's going to be a little more complicated.
what is 02 percent of 7
many are deceived, and
think 02 is the same as 02
But that's wrong thinking.
Because that's not 02.
This is 02
you can imagine that on 2 different ways
first road 02 divided by 100 the percentage means as much as divide me by 100
then count and multiply by 10
So this is going to be 2 divided by 1,000.
the 2 away is the komma disk technology
this is just going to be about two stitches to the left move other countries using a point like this
So let's start with 02.
and go 2 set to the left
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
So 2 times left
Then this is the decimal.
which will then be 0002,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
This is the technique
02 is equal to 0002
this error can easily happen to everyone
Why don't you take it so tragically when it happens?
So always be careful if
and meet
Now that we know
what 02 as decimal number is visible 0002
we still have to multiply it by the number of times we want to know the percentage
So we multiply 0002 by 7.
That's easy.
7 times 2 is 14.
And how many of them do we have in sum?
And how many of them do we have in sum?
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
That's one two three.
So we need to put one two three behind the decimal.
So 02 percent of 7 is equal to 0014.
young young man who looks like a pretty small number
young young man who looks like a pretty small number
And that makes sense, because when you think about it,
is 02 even less than 1 percent
And that's even smaller than a hundred.
and 02 is 1500
And when you calculate 7,500, you get to this number.
And when you calculate 7,500, you get to this number.
And it's important to do that.
It's always good to make a reality test
when this man counts the same and the percentages
It's easy to lose a factor 10 there or there.
or to be won
therefore always make a reality test to see if the result can be right
And it will be more confusing.
Next task 4 is 20 percent of which number
many think reflexively
I take 20 percent.
so 020
And multiply it by 4.
And that would be wrong thinking again.
warum
the task is not what are 20 of 4
the task is 20 of a given number is 4
We need some algebra now.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
x is this number
So the function is 20 of x is 4.
Now the task will perhaps become somewhat more transparent
what is 20 as the same number
is 020 or 02
And multiply this by x to get 4.
So 20 is the same thing as 02.
And that's the same thing as the 020 without the last zero.
which has no further meaning here
02 times x is equal to 4.
And now we have a linear equation of first degree
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
now there are 2 possibilities
you can divide both sides by the coefficient of x
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
So divide the left side by 02 and also the right side
And so you get x is equal to 4 divided by 02.
Now let's figure out what 4 is divided by 02.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
how often 02 goes into 4
to calculate this
Move the dot point to the right
So we get a 2 here.
And move it right over here.
So 02 fits kind into 4 who
2 in 40 fit
simple
2 fits as often in the 40
in 4, the 2 fits twice.
in 0 the 2 matches zero times
that goes in the head too
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
So 4 is divided by 02 is equal to 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 percent of 20.
makes sense
This can be viewed differently
20 percent is exactly a fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
that fits
for safety, we can check that again.
take 20 of 20
20 of 20 is equal to 02 times 20.
if you calculate this, the 4
so we checked the result
Let's do another exercise.
I choose the numbers randomly
here the task 3 is 9 percent of which number
again algebra x is the number of 3 is exactly 9 percent
You don't have to write that down.
Now we know 009 x means 9 percent of x.
So 9 percent of x is equal to 3.
or x is equal to 3 divided by 009
Now we run the division by 009 goes as often as in 3
We're going to make a decimal here.
I still don't know how many zeros we need.
I move the decimal two times to the right
I'll do that on the right.
So 009 fits exactly as often as 3 as
9 in 300 fit
in 30 fits 9 three times in
3 times 9 is 27.
it already looks like a pattern
30 3 times 9 is 27
you always get 3 3 3
forever and ever 3 3 3
the result is now 3 is 9 percent of 333
333 period dh the three never listen to 3333333
03 period as 0 033333 is the same as 13
So 3 is 9 percent of 33 and 13.
both answers are correct
and often you want to calculate the percentage
actually only have a rough estimate
precision is not always the most important
But in this case, we are precise.
and obviously you have to work in class and test
be very precise
I hope it wasn't too fast and a certain
Percentage fee generated
important in this kind of tasks is to be closely observed
how the problem is formulated
if it means 10 percent of 100
That's easy.
You just have to convert the 10 into a decimal number and multiply it by 100.
but if the formula is 100 is 10 percent of which number
then you have to remember that this is another problem.
in this case 100 is 10 percent of and if you calculate that
comes out 1000
I think in this module we had a great tempo
And I hope it wasn't too confusing.
But I'll take more of it.
Maybe you heard the concept of libor when people talk about phrases.
Or they say hey I'll lend you money a few percentage points over libor
You will hear libor in a few of the financial markets
what it really is is is just the average value of the interest rates in which banks borrow mutual money
and this value is calculated by the British bank association association association of the British banks
actually it is calculated by thomson reuters for the british bank association
and it exists to enable a kind of benchmark for other securities and financial transactions
dictionary stands libor for london interbank offered rate
So it's in London the interest rate that banks offer each other.
the London interbank between banks offered rate offered interest rate rate rate rate
to understand this a little bit better, we set up two banks here.
bank a and bank b maybe you already know
that if you enter money into a bank account
that the bank doesn't just leave the money behind
the bank where it pays a greater share of the money paid to other people
and it just keeps enough cash on hand cash file
that if people come and want to get money out of their bank account
the cash file is large enough
You can imagine, and again, the cash file of the bank could sink.
or very close to a kind of reserve requirement to impose minimum liability
which the central bank of a country requires the banks
So in this situation we say bank a approaches this situation
They say let me rent some money
Let me rent money from another bank.
This is interbank borrowing interbank credit taking
bank b right here have a lot of cash
So they say we don't want to have so much cash around
We want to rent it so we get zinc we don't get any zinc on barley
So bank b could give a bank a money
So maybe they give so much money.
So that's the new cash the bank got a
right here the new cash
And of course that's a credit.
So a new credit to calculate this reminds you
assets are equal to liabilities liabilities plus equity equity equity
So the connections are the whole thing here.
So it's a credit of b for this bargain.
They now have a bigger security buffer
And now b her loan to a has grown and her cash has fallen
So this is a loan a loan to a
They just took this cash and gave it to bank a
And the price for which they rent it,
maybe it was 1 per year.
and of course it has to be renewed daily it is the overnight rate overnight daily debt rate
this rate of interest is the interbank rate
So what do they do now on behalf of the British bank association?
They go and watch a big bank in London.
eight twelve sixteen banks in London
And they say hey, what was the zinc rate in which you carried out transitions?
And the banks give it to
and this entry is the overnight libor overnight daytime libor
So let's say 12 over all the banks that we've been watching.
But what's interesting about the libor is it's calculated for ten different currencies
not only in British pasta or dollars
or yen but in ten currencies
That's what really differentiated him, among other things.
and really differentiated from the efficiency rate of federal funds rate that is another interbank rate
But it's in the usa.
and this is more about monetary policy objectives
the federal bank central bank of usa is trying to control this actively
