Good day.
Hey, hey.
But that's a very nice trick.

You got a bottle?
Yeah, sure.
It is located in Vltava in the heart of the Czech Budějovic and offers three rooms.

And if you stay in our restaurant longer than you want - you know, it can happen - then you can use our fitness centre with the latest equipment.
I mean, I'm sorry, but I don't like fitness, don't you guys like massages?
Well, if you really don't like fitness, then you can visit our recreation centre where we offer massages, saunas, massage of lava rocks and more.
Well, yeah, I like that, great!

Bye, bye.

Goodbye!
Hey, my socks, my socks!
I'm tired.
This train service is so exhausting.
I have to sit somewhere.
Did I hear you right?
You're looking for a comfortable chair you could sit in and rest?

And, so...
Would you be interested?
Yes, you mentioned me.
Great!
So now that you've planned your office, what about looking at our modern chairs and tables?
They are carefully chosen, environmentally friendly and the entire production is taking place in Italy, as in all our products.
Oh, that would be a tough day!
You're right, really tough!
Do you think we'll get paid to participate in this fair?
Oh, sure!
You know, I don't feel confident because we sell fashion and trendy products like bedding and furniture...
People don't come to buy anything from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are made in Italy: everyone knows that this is a guarantee of high quality.
You're absolutely right, but remember, we're here to contact new customers.
Can we apply to these new markets?
Well, you know, our headquarters are in Venice, and that's the advantage: we're so close to these markets, Eastern Europe is right behind the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will be expensive!
This will mean a five-year loss in the first year.
Come on, think positive, these five percent will be our profit in the third year!
And I'm sure we got new customers today.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, everyone needs to sleep well.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, a comfortable mattress and a warm bed cover?
And it's all manufactured by our shock absorbers!
It's a dream!
Well, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!

Do you mind if I take my shoes?
Those high heels are destroying me!
Of course I do.
I won't mind.
Thank you.
Why are you wearing high heels when you can wear tennis?
I know a good store that's focused on selling free shoes.
Yeah, really?
Yes, actually, I work for him.
Its name is CaspoWalk Ltd. and we offer different types of footwear from different brands such as Nike, Adidas, for all age categories and sex.
Do you offer any special shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some shoes.
The special offer this month are Danish-type wood, and if you like sports, you would like brand new Nike shoes called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes you control on the phone.
You can modify the bonding of fabrics and the color of LED diodes using the mobile app.
If I bought my shoes at your place, would you offer me some supplements?
Yes, of course.
We offer fabrics and footwear and many more accessories.
Here's my card.
I'm sure you'll stop at our store.
All right, thanks.
You'll find us in this building.
We're taking part in the student company fair.
Thank you so much!
We came to my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
See you later.
Nice to meet you, too.
See you later.
Good afternoon, everyone, my name is <NAME>. And my name is <NAME>.
I would like to introduce you to SETA, which is a short one: smart phones, electronics and technological supplements.
We are a company that sells electronic equipment, such as printers, smart phones and watches.
In addition, we are an international company that communicates in French, English, Dutch and German.
We came to the fair and we have special offers ready for the buyers.
One of the slides concerns the Instax camera.
When you buy this camera, you'll get 100 free photo papers.
It is important to note that we also have quantitative discounts on orders over thirty products.
VAT is included in our prices.
Thank you for your time, and I hope to see you at our stand, it's number sixty-three.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Hi friends, my name is <NAME> and I'll introduce you to today's corporate presentation in which I represent the most famous fictional firm, just like Austria, Total Regal.
We've been ruling the market since 1999, and we've been fighting the dreams of other companies.
Our CEO actually led this company before some of you were born at all.
Imagine that.
So where is our headquarters?
Of course on the mountains.
No, I'm kidding, we really have other cities than Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirt and short leather pants, no, I'm kidding.
Actually, it can happen, though, that we're going to pull out traditional clothes to one of the countless parties that we're having when we want to get a beer or something.
Well, well, maybe two beers.
So why should you buy our products?
The most popular of our products, of which we have actually become real icons, we have been selling since 1999, i.e. for two decades.
For example, Helping Hand, which is a great way to store all kinds of clothes, such as jacket, or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and cables.
So come and look at our store and as we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
I would like to ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to present its presentation.
All right, this is our current state.
We have two national laws to give European regulation two directives.
One is about paper and digital publications.
Now they have the same rate.
And under certain circumstances, it's a zero rate, but under other circumstances it's six percent.
In the case of the rental of real estate we have accepted ...the possibility of renting real estate ... .. and the duty of VAT for the short-term rental of real estate.
Then we did two audits.
One relates to what we've heard several times, so I'll be very brief about it.
The second concerns the registration system.
And then we also have two new four trends.
Our MOS audit... so it's not complete yet and it's not even published.
All conclusions and recommendations are therefore only preliminary.
But we're almost sure there's no major changes.
Hmmm.
Our conclusions are essentially consistent with what we have heard here today.
But as far as we are concerned, I will only point out some things that are different, but which, in my opinion, are more specific to Belgium.
At present, we only have a limited number of employees in the administration, because we are more than a receiver, unlike the MSID that takes over money, and depend heavily on other Member States.
But in the future, when the MOS expands most, more workers will be needed.
And you should be trained now and known in advance.
Another general conclusion that we have reached, but which has already reached, is that there have been changes in control strategies.
What has to happen is a new direction of thinking.
But our administration strongly believes in the next MSID, because when we look at conclusions like MSCON...
Just skip from one to the other.
So we see that there is a very bad control strategy.
That is why we strongly believe that every MSID will send or transfer money.
That's for us.
However, we have underlined that it is important to make some progress in the area of control strategy, namely by creating risk profiles.
Our report has not yet been able to create good risk profiles because they do not have enough data, but they think they do in the future.
I have more data in the future and I could create certain risk profiles, so in the future we will be monitoring better control policy in the future.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We are following other taxpayers on the Internet, so there is a system to look for taxpayers on the Internet.
But in the meantime, the results are worse.
There are not many things about taxpayers that can be monitored.
Then we see that...
The MSIDD registration procedure is as good as that, but under circumstances when taxpayers are exposed...
There are no follow-up steps if they grant recognition in the normal system.
There is therefore no connection or any follow-up system, which we believe is important.
Then we have... in the confession process.
There are some automatic controls, which we consider very interesting.
So this is not a real check of completeness and correctness (yes, thank you) of completeness and correctness.
But it still helps when it comes to common mistakes.
The actual checks must therefore be carried out by MSCON, but as a MSID, but Belgium is still helping to complete the recognition, so there are certain errors.
In the system there will be an output, or if you have to make a choice and all options will be limited, just click on the possible choices, so there will be fewer errors.
As a MSCON, we also found that they work in Benelux.
So together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they have created a matrix of certain risks and are developing new control activities.
Based on these risks, there are already two test files that have been launched so far.
We therefore recommend continuing to work in this small group to make progress and disseminate knowledge into European fora.
I think it's about the differences that we've had, unlike what we haven't heard before.
So we're about to do a second audit.
He ran the audit of the registry warehouse system.
It's not about the audit that Luden and I did, but about the other members of the auditory cells.
It was also an audit that was somewhat wider than just a VT, but I only present conclusions and recommendations that are important for VT.
The audit focused on the effectiveness and effectiveness of the control policy.
Installations and applications, so they looked at two problems relating to the registration warehouse system.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations reached are such that the regulation is too complex.
It is therefore recommended to simplify the regulation, as there is too much exception to the national regulation.
It was very difficult to establish a certain group only on the basis of the statement itself.
And so it was very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that had to install the registration warehouse system.
Another major conclusion was control policy.
There are problems with the choice of taxpayers for taxpayers for the registration system.
When there was a limit, there's a limit, and if it's too low, then you fall right below this limit, and there's no more control, so that's the way to avoid legislation.
There has also been a problem with cross-checks of data from the database for the selection of taxpayers for their control.
Another conclusion was that there were bad internal controls for the application of the system.
With regard to the fines granted, they found that the various control units had given various penalties.
There were therefore no provisions for fines, but some were very strict and other control teams were not strict at all, or had penalties much lower than the rates that they also gave for certain errors.
It would be an advantage, but now it is not implemented, so risk analysis was very simple and there is no online access, but once we know that this kind of system exists in other countries when they have online access, when they have online access.
They found that this could be a very good advantage.
Then there was also an exchange of information with the National Social Security Office, which was not very good.
A lot of information has therefore not been obtained from one to the other.
Finally about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with placing transactions
The system as such works very well if it is used when it is used as it should be used, but if certain transactions were not entered into the system, they could not be discovered.
The solution could therefore be to create a media campaign so that customers can apply for tickets.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise, it will not be a ticket or that the legislation would be adapted to only electronic payments being accepted, because it would be easier to track money.
However, as a real impact, there is no reliable impact measurement, so they have no idea.
Our team then carried out several tests and tried to find some impact, but found that there was an effect of expectation, because the introduction of the system was delayed a few years.
However, they all knew this was coming, so customers and companies were already expecting legislation that would change and introduce this system.
The exact differences between VAT revenues prior to 2016, when the system was introduced and then were very difficult to trace.
As tax concessions to VAT have increased a few years before 2016, taking into account the new system that would be subject to change.
Our team wasn't sure about the effect.
It's just this system or that the effect was even greater because it started earlier than they thought.
Look, I can stop you, I just have a problem, or I'd like to understand it right.
What am I supposed to imagine under the notion of a system of registration warehouses?
Does that mean that this treasury system is registered somewhere in the database?
No, it's not, it's online, it's cash treasure, yeah "cash."
Yeah, okay, so it's just for cafes, hotels and restaurants.
It's just for certain sectors.
So far, it is only in the Horeca sector and it is a system that registers each transaction or should register any project that is submitted to the system.
(So) There is no online access.
That is why the selection of the control group is so important, because the control teams must go to different locations.
They can't focus on it online on computers, they have to go to HoReCa and connect their computer to the treasure.
To retrieve the data and carry out the check.
Yeah, but they can't do it far away.
It must always reach the operator itself.
So when recognition is too low and below limit.
The teams won't go there to find out if they know the cafeteria, for example, and they know there's a lot of customers and they're not there, but it's just a coincidence.
But that's something they found out later, so they will.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was afraid I was the only one who doesn't understand.
All right, but what's the difference between this system that you're talking about in the registration box for any seller, I mean in the food?
So what's so special about this particular system is that you're there.
There is a special software that offers any possibility of fraud with the system and it is also a software that ensures that the data are transferable to the control team computer.
While you cannot extract data in the normal registry system in the same way.
So these are the registration treasury systems they have.
Yes, they are also special, but I mean there are five different brands of registry stores from which you can choose and have certification.
That all data that can be extracted in data formats are suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yeah, yeah, so compatibility is certified, which is the main part of the domain of different sections.
Yes, you mentioned this analysis of the risk that there was no risk analysis of the risk services, or that they were not all performed or.
Do I mean online access to this analysis, or?
Online access to your own registry warehouse system.
Okay, so which controls could be much easier, well, and because we can carry out automatic checks or data extraction.
Which could be inserted into the larger system and risk analysis was actually very basic because they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or this system was introduced only in 2016, so they had only two years of data available.
All right, finally.
I have two new fraud trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called the Matrimony and consisted of a large number of foreign companies.
But always the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulhar.
But they registered on names that were very similar to known names.
There was a difference only in one letter so that it was possible to presume that these companies existed, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they only applied for VAT and asked for VAT with false invoices to be returned, but they always did so in writing and in very small amounts.
Which means the report had to put all the information in the system, which took time
And so some of the doors were already made before they could actually find out that there is a possibility of fraud and they could check whether the company actually exists and whether the invoices were given.
However, this kind of fraud has been discovered and has already been disseminated through Eurofisc, so I think that every tax administration is already informed about this kind of fraud.
Another fraud consisted of green energy certificates that were very similar to earlier CO3-2 certificates.
The original plan was more similar in sending invoices.
Or they used the company's invoices, which made a lot of comments to the legal firm that would otherwise send the invoices.
So we had a fraud plan, so I shortened it a lot, and I don't have a picture of it.
But I'll explain it this way.
There was a company A in the Member State X which, according to certificates from B in another Member State A, sold these certificates to C.
Again another Member State Z and sent this company an invoice of the corresponding A with a line...
So that's the name of a company that's different from just one letter from the original.
So Company C wouldn't see that they're actually cheating.
And of course, company A and company A made the same managers that have this company A, and A with the line would be a missing trader.
I hope this kind of fraud is clear.
And that was the end of my presentation.
Well, if you will.
I would like to ask our Polish colleagues to submit their presentation.
Thank you.
And I would like to say a few words about the new regulations and the new instruments that were introduced last year and during this year to restore memory.
We met some of them at our last plenary session in Warsaw.
So those of you who were in Warsaw should know something about that.
So I would like to briefly remind you of some of them and then tell you about our previous audit in this area and our conclusions.
I would first like to mention the single audit file.
We started implementing these instruments three years ago.
Last year, however, the last phase took place because the first phase was that the single audit file had to be submitted to the financial authorities on request.
And now it's an automatic system.
The information shall be submitted electronically without any request.
And since 1 July last year
This is mandatory for all types of economic operators.
Since 2016.
it was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, smaller and now for all companies.
I will also return to this because we consider this to be key in the fight against VAT reduction.
The second legal provision I would like to mention is the so-called ‘fuel package’, and in this case it also applies that the regulation has been introduced gradually.
Dependent on the type of undertaking and its main idea is that fuel trading licences are granted only to companies established in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign companies are registered.
Another requirement is the transport package.
It should be said that the proposal for this law is based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
As we know, the first law of this kind was introduced in Hungary and in Poland we have introduced this system of monitoring the transport of goods only for certain types of certain categories of goods.
In general, these are goods from which excise duty is levied.
I mean fuel, tobacco and some others, and I mean monitoring how this goods are transported by road or by rail.
This means that each individual transport must be replaced before the start of the transport, in a special system, in a reserved system and since last year, in addition, each transport is connected with a geolocation.
So every single truck can determine where it is.
Engineering, parking, etc.
And the Minister of Finance for the Ministry of Finance, which analyzes the entire system of large data that has been delivered online, some of the public institutions, and as we know, there can be a lot of results and there can be some inconsistencies in many.
And this year we plan to carry out an audit of the Ministry of Finance.
As the Ministry of Finance is prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is introduced in the sense that all these companies must register all transport and the system is ready for analysis.
So far, however, we do not know whether the Minister of Finance is using this information for any action taken by the financial authorities.
The other legislation is, to a certain extent, similar to what our colleague, who specializes in technical issues, presented yesterday.
So we have a certain black paper, but in Poland, under the term black paper, we have a list of entities that have been removed from the VAT register.
And we have a system based on information, re-given by online banks and other entities of the financial system.
This system may be used by the Minister of Finance to identify any inconsistencies and problems, and this system is aimed at encouraging unusual transactions and providing information about them to financial authorities online.
On the basis of this information, the financial authority may block the account, the bank account and the specific transaction.
What is the risk of getting a higher fine than, let's say, 10,000 euros.
Another legal provision is the distribution of payments introduced last year.
It's not necessary right now.
But it really matters to the buyer.
If one Contracting Party uses this, then, of course, the payment method for suppliers is mandatory.
It is important that, if this mechanism of payment distribution is used, the common and unbundled liability of the taxpayer is excluded.
I'll show you some numbers, and in a little while, I'll tell you how this distribution can be used in the payment mechanism.
Finally, there is one legislative and organisational instrument that our colleague from the Ministry of Finance had relatively detailed reviews last year.
So we have a new national income management based on the previous free administration, and now we have another administration that is fighting tax and customs administration in one system.
And yet online registration system
Ha ha ha.
At the moment, we have a mandatory type of record-keeping system and the mandatory element of these records is electronic memory.
The financial office is therefore able, on the basis of memory, to verify the authorised types of registration warehouses, but we are only starting with the online registration system for some sectors.
They are primarily legal services, medical services, only certain sectors.
As a result, we must start working on the creation of a central system, which will be headed by the national revenue administration.
In this system, all these transactions should be registered immediately and easily online.
That is why we are going to use this debate to introduce a possible distribution of payments for all taxpayers affected.
This actually means that we would like the financial authorities to wish to replace the transfer of tax obligations by this mechanism of payment distribution and transfer of tax liabilities and liability to society and not share them.
This fall in all sectors where the transferred tax obligation or joint and non-discriminatory liability is binding could apply to all these sectors to this mechanism of payment distribution.
Now that I've submitted, I'll tell you something about our audit.
We ran the audit last year.
The period for which the audit was carried out was relatively long - it was twelve years, and that is why we were also asked by the Polish House of Parliament to carry out such an audit.
We have reached the following conclusions.
We must have noted that the effectiveness of the Ministry of Finance's work has been significantly deteriorating during this long period.
In 2010-2015, we believe that the Ministry of Finance and Finance have developed a somewhat insufficient effort to improve their efficiency in VAT revenue.
As the subject of the audit was the supervision of the Ministry of Finance on Tax Revenue and the choice of taxes, in particular the choice of VAT, it was just here.
One of the signs of this mentioned collapsibility is the effectiveness of the work is
VAT GAP.
And during these years, VAT GAP in Poland was on average 24%, which was about ten points more than the EU media.
Among other things, we have decided that supervision has not been effectively contacted.
So that's how it is.
It can be noted that we have information about VAT GAP in Poland and EU countries and that we have figures from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And as you can see, the average VAT gap in Europe is definitely lower than in Poland; even if we do not take into account the source of information, the figures speak quite clearly.
Mmmm.
I have already said that our main instrument and the main instrument of the financial institutions, as well as the idea put into practice in this period, has been the single audit file, and in the last two years.
For example, in 2017, four million invoices were automatically analysed, but only 3,300 warnings were issued on the basis of these analyses.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed was not too high - it was about five million, but the analysis brought more than 350 000 warnings.
This was reflected in receipts because the first stage is automatic analysis and then comes warning sent via text or email.
So without any official procedure in tax administration, etc.
And this system, and its first phase, the automatic phase, has brought us additional revenue, VAT revenue of more than EUR 150 million per year.
I am talking about numbers for 2017 and 2018.
It should be pointed out that there has been an increase in revenue under the conditions of a good economic situation and an improvement in the choice of VAT, as a result of a large package of legislative and organisational changes.
Nevertheless, we believe that one of the main sources of these results, these financial results, is the introduction of this single audit file.
As a result of another instrument, a mechanism for the distribution of payments in 2018 followed the use of a mechanism for the distribution of payments, which, as I have already mentioned, was unnecessary.
However, we note the increased interest in the implementation of payments in this way.
In July last year, taxpayers made 600 000 transactions.
In December, more than one and a half million transactions were distributed through the mechanism.
The value of the tax paid through this mechanism of distributed payments in July amounted to half a billion euros.
And half a billion euros by December 1st.
Overall, during the period July to December last year, taxpayers carried out more than seven million transactions through a mechanism for the distribution of payments and the amount of tax on special accounts for VAT.
And yet another information about the work of the financial authorities, the financial authorities and the ministry carried out 30 percent less checks last year than in 2017, but with fewer controls, the percentage of checks increased.
In our view, this is the result of the new electronic tools that have been introduced, which have helped to better select entities where checks should be carried out.
It is clear that a reduction in the number of controls has been achieved by reducing the number of controls accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is obviously less painful for taxpayers and is more time consuming.
This led to an increase of 100% in the findings last year compared to 2017.
So we generally believe that several legislative instruments have been introduced in the last few years.
In summary, the results are sufficient.
However, we must not forget that this was done under economically favourable conditions.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine exactly what part of these increased revenues was caused by any factor.
If this is the result of new organisational and legislative instruments
and whether the overall economic situation can do so.
That's all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions, please ask.
Do you have any further questions?
If not, I would like to ask our Romanian colleagues for a word.
All right, good day.
You all hear me well?
Yes?
So in Romania, we have already introduced nineteen per cent VAT for two years.
And although plans to reduce to eighteen percent have emerged, they have been postponed so far.
In addition, we have two reduced rates of VAT, nine percent and five percent.
In the past year, there have been several changes as regards products that may have a reduced rate.
The biggest change, therefore, will be the sewerage services where the first January of this year began to reduce the rate from nineteen percent to nine percent.
Other appropriations shall remain unchanged.
On the contrary, there have been many changes in the five-year rate, especially in some products, which were at nine per cent and now have been converted to five per cent.
The biggest change was made on 1 June of this year; this change concerned high-quality food and mountain products and traditional products.
And for products produced on the mountains, it is true that cows or sheep that produce them must live there at least half of their lives.
The manufacturer must obtain the authorisation, certificate from the Minister for Agriculture.
Then it will be able to apply a reduced rate.
Then here we have a mechanism transferred to tax liabilities.
In Romania, both companies must be registered in order to be able to use this system.
There are fourteen products for which this can be reduced, and in December two thousand eighteen had to be extended for some of them until the year twenty-two.
Finally, the value added tax system, which was introduced in the year of two thousand seventeen, although it now seems that the Ministry of Finance has somewhat forgotten it.
In the year two thousand seventeen it began with more than four hundred companies and now in the year two thousand nineteen their number fell to forty-six percent.
Moreover, in the year two thousand eighteen did not start using this system any new companies.
So all the companies that started with this started to return from that system to the normal VAT system.
In addition, the European Commission has ordered Romania to stop using this system.
It therefore seems that the system has not met what was expected of it, so the ministry will probably stop using it completely.
Totally?
I come from the data we have at our disposal because no new companies were registered in the year of two thousand eighteen or two thousand nineteen in the year.
So there are only companies in the system that started in the year two thousand seventeen, and their number is falling slowly.
With regard to all these findings, there are still certain regulatory frameworks for the MOSS system, which is in Romania for some reason labelled as M1SS, because they have translated it.
But that's just how it is.
In addition, we lack IT systems in financial offices that could cooperate and exchange data.
Which will not simplify the situation for companies, and last year we finally introduced the electronic system they have in Belgium.
They have introduced electronic registration treasures and companies are now obliged to start using them, so the financial authorities are checking that all companies are installed.
So far, however, we are not sure whether the system is fully functional because of the limits in the IT system of financial authorities.
And so far, no new trends have been identified.
So that would be all.
Thank you.
Okay, so we did this audit.
The audit report will be published on 16 July.
Therefore keep this information secret.
They shall be subject to the publication of the information embargo.
We are waiting for the Commission's response in all 23 official EU languages.
Because we only have an answer in English, so it's just a formality, and the audit is now behind us.
The name was "Many calls..." and the special report will be "There are a lot of challenges to deal with when choosing VAT from customs duties."
It's about to be solved.
It should initially have been “to be addressed”, but some have already been addressed to a certain extent through new legislation, a new Commission proposal, which has just referred to …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
However, there are still problems that remain to be resolved and we will see them later.
So I'm going to start with why we chose this audit topic.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
And we'll finish our recommendations.
First of all, okay, we did a survey because we're visiting previous research analyses.
On the basis of the findings of the head of these institutions in the field of electronic commerce, German colleagues, Lithuanian colleagues carried out audits.
Also in the previous decision we made on imports, we are analysing the problem of distance from countries outside the EU and related problems relating to VAT and customs duties, and we have decided that this has happened.
The problem is that fair traders are often excluded from the market by unfair traders and are no longer able to compete.
This is a problem that also arose a representative of the academic community, such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and is particularly intense in the UK.
Also estimates of loss.
There are only estimates of distance from non-EU countries.
However, these estimates are not too encouraging, because even if the Commission estimates only five billion annually, it is between £1.5 billion and £1.5 billion annually in the UK.
That's how they estimated losses.
This represents a 8-10% reduction in VAT in the United Kingdom.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently represents only four percent.
So the triple fight against fraud in the UK represents the amount of losses in electronic commerce with goods purchased from third countries.
This is a mission.
We do not count on EU remote sales here, we do not count most electronic services here.
So the basis is to raise our concerns.
Then what we are focusing on is to visit five Member States - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why have we taken into account the number of registrations to the MOS system both in programmes outside the EU and in the US?
The volume of electronic sales within the EU as well as the estimated amount of VAT saved as a result of the VAT exemption on imports of non-durable goods (LVCR).
Following the study of our resources in the Commission, we also visited the Commission.
These steps should be delayed by technology and the World Customs Organisation and the repealed period should last from 2015 to the end of 2018.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposed proposal and all the proposals that will enter into force in 2021.
What are we focusing on?
Of course, we have begun to analyze the answers to our research, and this research, which has been sent by the main group of two.
We continue with the questionnaire in all the Member States that we have visited in discussions with all possible people.
We have gained access, and what is also very important, we have set access to ABC data in the Synergia database, i.e. incident database, problems that Member States report in the MOS system.
We have received access to all project groups of taxation (fiscal) and electronic groups dealing with electronic commerce, and to all project groups related to the BUT, where there is a lot of information and discussion.
And of course, we got funding from the support of institutions from Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally we did our own samples of different transactions.
Overall, we have put together nearly nine hundred transactions related to electronic commerce.
What we find, of course, were first positive things and then we will continue with the most negative ones.
The regulatory framework is governed by the best international procedures with the OECD and World Customs Organisation extremes.
In most respects, the principle of taxation at the place of destination has been observed in most cases, with the exception of this principle.
There is now a new limit value below EUR 10 000 that you can provide in the home Member State, so that is not in line with the OECD.
In the case of the World Customs Organization dealing with imported packages, the guidelines for immediate release have been respected in most respects and also a new proposal within the framework of the standard.
The Commission is a pioneer in this area and, in most respects, adapts itself to the World Customs Organization and standards.
As regards the new provisions which will enter into force in 2021...
I'm trying to solve some weaknesses, but for us, it's the main problem that's still going to exist, underevaluation.
Losses of VAT and customs duties are experience and will continue.
This cannot be addressed by the proposal for an information network with payment service providers.
As far as trade with countries outside the EU is concerned, it will not be resolved, and we will see why later.
Why, yes, because agreements on administrative cooperation with third countries do not work.
We have a new deal with Norway.
We expect a change of information with Norway to work, but that's not a problem.
It's not Norway, the problem is China, it's the United States of America.
The information chain with China is not working because the Chinese counterpart is not responding and the percentage of responses is falling and falling, so that's the problem.
If we have information about a change of supplier that does not work through electronic interfaces, i.e. works directly on their websites that have not been registered in the MOS or even registered and after cancellation.
As we pay VAT from Europe to China, we expect VAT to return to the EU.
Unless we have administrative cooperation, too.
It will never happen.
This is also a problem between EU countries, which is not expected to work.
Administrative cooperation also, so we will see later that the checks carried out by national tax authorities are weak.
Because there are practically no tools to carry out proper risk analysis of the accident that we have already mentioned.
It will therefore be necessary for the Member State to approve the Commission's proposal to amend the information, while payment service providers subject to control by the Commission are insufficient.
And we will see later, of course, that the Commission has not carried out any monitoring or monitoring on this.
In their own electronic systems of recovery, there are weaknesses.
The traditional problem, of course, is that traders underestimated goods to be below the euro threshold for VAT for twenty-two or ten years.
This will disappear in the future, but will continue to be underestimated to pay lower VAT.
It will not be approved, but they will pay less and as far as customs duties are concerned, the assumption is set at EUR 100 50 and cannot be managed.
Because in all electronic ... we will see the EU electronic invoicing system later, they cannot stop the declaration.
Because the cover box has its own electronic..., which applies to the customer electronically because of the catches.
And they passed the system even though they declared the value that is over a hundred fifty.
The electronic system cannot stop this, they said it was something very serious, because the operators working there are hopeful economic operators.
So, the great couriers have the authority of the association of economic operators and say they're the most reliable, but they're abusing this system.
The imposition of customs duties on VAT is not effective.
Okay, provisions on the information chain on the recovery of claims relating to this tax.
The rules were used, of the five Member States that we visited, only in Austria.
Only in five cases, so it's not often used.
We are analysing the inadequacy of payments between Member States.
We have access to the harmonisation of the Committees and there are still mentioned combinations.
Important means a lot between Member States.
In the Netherlands, of course, the problem is that they cannot harmonise, which explains the amounts of VAT received with VAT.
And the problems are also with the comments that our colleagues from NKU yesterday...
They anticipated a problem with Member States' comments on consumption that are not ...
Here is a summary of our findings regarding MOS samples.
We have come to the conclusion that MOS IT infrastructure meets its objectives and is therefore strong.
This can be done by the user, so IT infrastructure is solid, but there are problems with registration and payments between Member States.
For example, as regards the analysis of the incidence reported in the Synergy, there are only twenty-two cases in the Synergy database between Member States, but in five Member States.
Which we have examined, in which Member State the problem has already arisen and as an influential Member State.
There were only twelve cases, so there were not so many cases, the problem is that the position of the Member States was really passive.
Only when the problems escalated, they started working on it, but the solution of the problems lasts a long time.
As far as MOS is concerned, it takes a long time, but there are not many problems.
Also, in view of the technical errors reported and received between Member States, the response is also very passive, it is not proactive only when the problem escalates as an incident to which they start responding.
But this infrastructure for MOS is robust.
We've assessed whether they're ready for a single contact point.
We have received several complaints, especially from Austria.
They say that they will not be prepared, nor from the Dutch road that we have not analysed, because the system is developing in particular to ban using a single point of contact for imports.
Registration problems are here.
We need to distinguish between the system outside the US and the EU system, only eighty per cent of registration applications have not been properly controlled.
As far as the known system is concerned outside the United States and we have even found it, we have found cases of two registrations, which is something serious, since as far as payments are concerned, the problem is particularly the problem of the missing ones.
And sometimes according to the Member State of identification.
And problems with registration and cancellation of registration.
This is the most relevant cooperation of the administrative authorities, it is the exchange of information between the Member States that we have visited.
And here we compare with the overall activity of information chains, which we see, for example, that there are general information requirements that have been sent to one hundred and eighty-two compared to the total information requirements.
Generally speaking, it does not have to do with the usual nine thousand two hundred, so neither in the UK will many of them be more problematic, for example three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is good, it is very low, and also some Member States have not changed, which is not why we recommend separating the centralised national office of the CNO.
A separate structure intended for electronic commerce or at least for MOS, so the level of information transmission is very weak.
Then we have multilateral controls, in two cases there were six cases of multilateral controls.
It was a really successful experience.
In two cases, however, this was not at all successful, as the Member State of identification refused to participate in multilateral checks.
This is something that should be resolved by advocating new legislation, because now two Member States can ask for control.
Another is the recent request that the other Member State should not refuse such participation.
So let us hope that this will improve, but there are other important things for Eurofisc.
There were four hundred eighty signals, a chain through Eurofisc works for electronic commerce full of five, and only one feedback link for these four hundred and eighty.
Therefore, the Member State did not consider this information to be very useful, it does not know why only five Member States were selected, the seniors entered the database.
And the others didn't read it because they didn't think the information was too useful.
There are therefore also a number of signals concerning trends or the subject of fraud, three or four topics that they consider useful.
And then there are changing tools for web crawling, but that is something that some members legally take over in their country.
In other Member States, national legislation prevents them from using web crawling tools.
The work file is now frozen and frozen activities are not useful.
They are waiting for a proposal for an information chain between payment service providers.
Because they will, they will have the database and access.
This is the Commission's proposal on all information provided to payment service providers as well as other countries on the Commission's proposal.
Of course, we support and submit a proposal very much to the report, but I did not know until yesterday that I asked myself that the Commission also needs some support for this proposal, because Lubik Lubis needs some support for it, because it does.
However, I accepted this in the Council, of course, because this proposal comes from some discussion in some forums with the Member States and with the parties involved.
Let's hope... this is very important, because the next problem is the lack of controls, audits for MOS.
Why is there so little audit?
You can compare here that no one is, because it's never how I can, if not, I don't know I don't have a data area analysis.
So my audit is going to be random with maybe a lot of information and no records, so they're going to need some data, and this is the data.
In addition, the company will have a lot more applications.
Yeah, they seem to understand Germany because we have data.
It's a team outside the United States, but information that can be available.
Phenomena.
But I don't know anymore, there's practically no control anymore.
Furthermore, remote sensing within the EU has not been too successful.
The customs office therefore has the results of a sample of courier from and abuse of postal services.
In the mail, the main problem in solving the question of undervaluation is that you have drones very expensive drones declared under ten units or up to twenty two euros.
Samples like this are thousands of times as simple.
And they can read and it's very difficult to handle it at the post office level.
And for couriers, they're abusing the usual catch of a hundred fifty, because I'm just going to take a cover box and then 50 can't close.
Declaration of termination of the declaration, even if devaluation is higher than one hundred fifty, we check that not only in the sample, but also directly in the procurement electronic system in the midst of the review, we have carried out a number of inspections.
The Member States did not work in any Member State, only in Austria.
But he didn't wake up in Austria.
We made another declaration on alcohol.
And then for alcohol it was banned and because this categorisation is applicable to alcoholic products.
There are therefore some errors in the Austrian system.
This and the problem are therefore approved by the economic operator who abuses this system of the most reliable traders on the contract.
Furthermore, we have a recommendation recommended for the Commission to use the structures provided in the mutual assistance agreements with countries outside the EU.
If you want to solve these problems, solve problems find a lack of answers.
Also carry out on-the-spot inspections of Member States' inspections on catches.
Minimally monitor the operation of distance selling within the EU, mixed goods are the only thing the Commission has not accepted.
That's why they laughed yesterday because your job is
Monitoring the commission and <CENSORED 22:25> said, "Yes, yes, yes."
I was laughing, but fine.
They help the Member State develop a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for new arrivals.
Because this is a problem, we cannot know whether or not the system works.
It is assumed that most systems will succeed, but it is usually a presumption, and that is why we estimate most of the VAT gap.
We do not know whether the system is successful, and we do not have any estimate for the European Union itself, so that would be very important.
Since the Commission helps Member States to develop, it is a matter of calculating the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative solutions.
In order to address VAT fraud, there may be aid in the form of an alternative payment distribution system.
With the use of blockchain technology, roads, KPMG KPMG and Professor E. Ensworth's proposal are proposed.
There are very interesting proposals, of course, which we have discussed with the Commission, and the Commission says that they are theoretically, in practice, coming to a solution.
In fact, there was no practical application, Professor Lamas also presented several proposals for the use of technology for imports from countries outside the EU.
However, this system is accepted by many other countries.
There's no practical experience, but I think it's also worth going deeper into blockchain technology that offers opportunities.
This is something that the Committee on the Management of the Database of Important Mixed Goods Trade is also investigating.
Number for reporting the validity of these numbers.
It is very important who the future is, the only way to deal with using the name of new technology for the Member States.
Of course, we like them to start responding to fraud and modifying Eurofisc.
Also follow the compromise in line with the new limit of EUR 10 000.
That is something the Czech colleagues have pointed out in their report.
And we took it into consideration also for the reason they explained it earlier.
In order for us to have a separate MOS and a remote coordination function for colleagues, we must ensure that the trader can introduce the VAT rate, the correct VAT rate in VAT returns to the MOS.
Because when a trader introduces a bad VAT rate, he only gets advice, but admittance can be sent the same way, so he gets advice, but he will still be sent.
Please also carry out the necessary checks after receiving an application for registration in the MOS to avoid this problem of two registrations.
Increases the audit activity of most SME traders and sellers on a remote basis through administrative cooperation instruments.
Employee of regular VAT estimates in electronic commerce.
Therefore, if we were to be very grateful for this recommendation to the Member States, we would be very grateful if you would remember in your home country the importance of following our recommendations.
That is why we are seeking your cooperation in this matter, and that is all we know if you have any questions.
I now give the floor to Mr Mayrbeurl.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
It's a great honor for me to be able to speak here.
I will try to introduce you briefly to our tool for a large amount of data that we have been using in the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
So before I really start, I'd like to inform you about the situation in the largest Austrian municipalities.
It is a municipality with more than 10,000 inhabitants, and since the year two,000 eleven we have been entitled to control all these local authorities.
This border was twenty thousand before.
The gray dots therefore represent more than twenty thousand inhabitants and the blue less than twenty thousand.
The explanation is still in German.
I'm sorry about that.
In total, therefore, we are entitled to carry out audits of seventy-five municipalities.
This represents about 3.2 per cent of the total number of municipalities
However, we provide counselling to all Austrian citizens.
That is why we in our department have decided to develop a special tool, which we call the Instrument for the Monitoring of Victims.
The development team consists of three young economists working in our department.
We all three use this tool for different purposes.
So what was the purpose of this instrument, why has this instrument been created at all?
The main reason was the effort to find an analytical tool for assessing financial risk.
So first we try to design a profile for each village.
In view of all relevant factors.
In the second step, we assess the municipalities, taking into account their importance for the audit activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we rank the municipalities according to financial risk on the basis of certain indicators.
The order is always interesting, it's all the more interesting because it gives us the opportunity to compare all the victims.
Thank you.
The main task of each database project is therefore to collect quality data.
We heard about the day before.
In this context, we must mention that Austria's statistics are very helpful to us, which is the Austrian Statistical Agency, and this agency is our most important partner in this project.
We got the following data from them.
These data are actually available to every citizen.
However, if you want aggregated data, you need to buy it from Statistics Austria.
And for analysis, only aggregated data are useful.
So we have cross-cutting accounts of budgets and accounting regulations.
We have detailed information about closed accounts, so we have accounts at the level of free tickets.
And then we have debt and commitment statements.
We are therefore mainly using financial and accounting data, but of course we have special data on the number of people and other data derived from Statistics Austria.
Now we have data from this period from 2,000 to 8,000 to 12,000.
And that's a mistake I apologize for.
This date is constantly updated, always every autumn.
Because we have data from the victim's accounting systems, we do not have any data on the contributors, we do not have any data on the rental obligations, nor do we have any residual data on the debts.
This is important because, in practice, you have an official accountant in your municipality, you will find some amount of debt, and if you look at the contributions of the civil society, it can happen that there is this value here.
So from the current data, we think our indicators are good, which I will explain later, and we will try to create an indicator model and this monitoring is based on a model that is composed of indicators.
The statistics are derived from one to one hundred, which is most relevant for the audit.
This model therefore allows indicators to be evaluated according to specific topics.
And in order to determine the relevance of the audit, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses indicators of the financial situation as a basic setting, but depending on the questions raised, depending on the subject of another audit, you can choose a different subject.
Then you get a different result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four topics and the first is the financial situation in the long term.
That means we're going to take the net debts plus the liabilities minus the holding of securities and the minus reserve.
So the first of them gives us a long-term perspective, which means debt minus assets.
And the other one gives us a short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we define the basic balance, which is the usual income without transfers minus normal expenditure without transfers and pensions.
This is an important point in the indicator model, because we do not use the key data that I have expressed to the population.
We use other data as a relevant number, and this is our own income, because it is better to show the economic strength of the village.
There are also a number of administrative structures.
There we simply put together administrative expenditure and personal expenditure.
Personal data is the most challenging task for us.
We tried to assess the quality of the accounting systems.
And yes, we take into account other accounts, different accounts, representation expenses and analysis of special accounts.
This means that using these data we are trying to find errors in the accounts.
So this image is a picture of the screen of one possible output of the monitoring tool.
And you see here the villages that are at the end of the list, from the best village to the worst.
The black column gives value, therefore, taking into account the importance of audit activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors, and is therefore evaluated for the importance of audit for our departments.
So the four columns on the right represent the indicators.
Indicators of the model I explained earlier.
The black column gives the value of three whole thirty-three, which is the village of Halvank, a small village near Salzburg and is the best village.
This is therefore a measure.
So if you want to carry out an audit of the municipality with the best financial location in the best financial situation, we will carry out an audit of Halvank.
If you want to run the worst village audit, just skip the picture and find the last one, but I don't want to show you these villages today.
In our system we have all the Austrian municipalities, but not every municipality falls within our assignment, so only the second, yes, we can audit only the second.
We are trying to compare the village with the same class of victims of the same size, so we do not compare Vienna with Halvank. We are trying to find similar villages to make this comparison fair.
So we have a lot of different possibilities to get out of this tool, and the other function is this output log for each individual village.
So here's the village of Halvank, for example.
We can make such a diary for each municipality in Austria, and you will not be able to read it, as you can see, but will provide us with a whole series of key figures, indicators, graphs and financial situation information.
Another output of the diary is these two pages, where you can see, for example, the left-hand analysis of personal expenditure, this is the red line of the graph.
And when compared to other municipalities, you can choose a blue line and where the red line crosses the blue line, the village is worse.
Or
So you can easily assess whether the municipality has excessive expenditure.
And on the right hand, we have transfers, which means we've got the rest and the income from the victim's point of view.
But it's just two outputs out of many.
We are currently using some statistical programs like R Stat Plus, and we can carry out any analysis that is necessary - which our supervisors want us to do.
As you can see, we are using this tool for auditing planning, preparing, operating and requesting, which means that if someone wants to use this village only for presentation, they can use it.
If you want to know which victims are worse in the region, we can do that and this information helps us not only in the audit itself.
And in accordance with our advisory approach, we provide information about things to the public.
This means that if we are called by some concern and want to know about his victim and what their financial situation is in this victim, we can provide them with surveys and a diary.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
<CENSORED>, are you on duty?
Shall I start?
Yes.
Yeah, ha ha ha ha, I'm sorry.
First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your conference on electronic data.
The right to access government information is a fundamental democratic right.
To this end, it is necessary for the government to share public information.
Since the entry into force of the law, the company has changed a lot.
Information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
In time, virtually all people started using the Internet, often on more devices.
The government of the twenty-first century can respond to these tasks by providing the public with direct access to government information.
In other words, the government could actively publish the open data.
In such a case, the volume of open data should be assessed in the context of the transition to digital governance.
At the same time, the pace in this area is given here by the United Kingdom, together with the United States.
Obviously, these countries do not regard the open data as a target or as a means of achieving greater transparency.
From a global point of view, they take the lead in terms of an open government partnership.
This is an initiative that should make the government as open as possible.
And there are a number of European directives and treaties in Europe that are important for legislation and open data policy.
The Dutch government also has a considerable ambition in the area of open data and has adopted new rules.
However, the actual implementation is still in the back.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former President, Mrs Stuiveling, see great potential in the open data.
In 2013, we decided to monitor the development of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We conducted a research aimed at the determination of ministries to apply an open data policy.
Our approach is positive, because we have focused on the ministry that has done well, and on the contrary, we have tried to encourage the ministry that has remained.
By meeting experts on open data and public officials and publishing good examples of information reviews at national and international level.
In the second report, we underlined the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers the government opportunities.
By openly informing the government of its expenditure and performance, it will have a better idea of its own financing.
This will change the way Parliament monitors the government.
Open data sets would increase transparency and government access for citizens.
From a commercial point of view, innovative entrepreneurs can transfer open data to new applications.
One of our objectives was to find what the Netherlands could learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Using data for an open data biometer conducted by the World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of the open data.
Information on ensuring positive results from government initiatives on open data.
The extent to which data are available.
And the impact on society, economy and government.
ehm society, economy and government.
And if we compare... excuse me.
Excuse me.
My voice on the monitor is kind of connected.
I'm pretty upset.
All right, all right.
We can continue.
Comparing the United Kingdom and the United States with the Netherlands,
based on this, the UK and the US, taking into account implementation and impact better.
With regard to their readiness to open data, there is only a small difference between them.
On the contrary, the Netherlands is well prepared for worse.
This concerns only the right to information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the United Kingdom and the United States publish much more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data files is huge in the United States.
The type of data published by the country differs from the number of points.
The Netherlands is currently publishing only a few open data on government expenditure and public procurement.
Nor is the Dutch trade register too open.
On the contrary, as you can see, Britain has open data in all areas.
The impact of open data is political, social and economic.
From a social and economic point of view, the Netherlands remains behind the UK and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands is less using open data to involve citizens in the creation and control of government policy.
The economic benefit of open data is only very small.
In both our reports, we have set out international examples that can be a good example for the Netherlands.
In Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on hospital waiting times.
We didn't just call for open data barometers.
And we did our own research.
And to make a better idea of the currently available volume and type of open data
We looked at the data published on our national open file portal.
A total of 15,000 data files were available in February.
And more than half of the data files were provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by the central government comes from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands is the Ministry of Public Works.
In the case of our two reports, we have asked all ministries what steps they are taking to publish the open data.
The scores we gave each ministry were based on six indicators.
This was, for example, support from the Ministry's management and the entity's action plan.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have adopted exceptional initiatives to publish the open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and what funding it provided in the year two thousand fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice did not have time or money to publish public data.
However, the other ministry has entrusted several employees with the publication of open data and has released the budget for these activities.
On the basis of the study of the years, we have reached the conclusion that the open data is a standard, but are not yet in practice.
And given what was lawful about open data, it was mainly about governments, what the government knows, rather than what the government does.
We also received a few comments that rely on the success of open data policy.
And the government should better inform about what data are available.
They should create the right conditions, the right conditions for the open data.
And the third was that the government must invest in both; on the other hand, offers and requests for open data.
For example, setting up an open data institute.
For our report for the year two thousand and fifteen, we have found that the government and the ministry have taken steps to increase the acceptance of open data.
Partially in response to our first open data report, the Ministry of the Interior is currently coordinating the entire government data file analysis.
The Netherlands follows the good examples set by the United Kingdom and the United States.
There was an accident.
We also found that the open data provided through the national portal was unilateral.
Almost all open data files are geo-data, geographic data and almost all are published by one ministry.
Only very few data are important for public control of government finances and government activity is available.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account in the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch Government should therefore define objectives and milestones in a specific action plan.
We also think that opening data should be mandatory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
It should determine which data are of the greatest social importance and what data should be available in any case.
And the government should use the open data itself, for example in decentralizing social networks.
In the Netherlands, this is a major national programme in which responsibility is transferred from central government to the municipality.
Our reports have had a positive impact.
The Ministry of the Interior will publish the results of the national data survey within this month.
The House adopted a proposal for a national information infrastructure.
And on the basis of the data inventory, the Ministry of the Interior will set up a national open data agenda.
It will publish in this agenda what data will be opened and when they will be opened.
We're trying to set an example.
On our websites we have published our own expenses so that everyone can see why the Dutch Court of Auditors is wasting their money.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open expenditure.
The Ministry of Finance is now planning to make detailed data on expenditure available to the government next year.
All right, all right.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is evolving positively and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor developments,
Thank you for your attention.
In case of your interest, you can find our reports on our website in English and data on our expenditure in Dutch.
we have a role a girl is about to make 3 police for
of his father
has a piece of a ring that is 12 meters long
wants the top police to be less than a meter short of
medium font
I'll do it in different colors.
So he wants the top police to be half a meter shorter than
medium font
read the entire edition first
and the underside shall be less than a half meter long
upper font
choose another color
I'll make it blue.
The lower shelf will be less than a half meter short of twice
length of upper font
how long will the individual boxes be if
consumes a whole 12-metre ring
Let's denote the variable lengths of the font
Because that's what we have to calculate.
We have the upper police and the middle police.
and underwear
So let's say t denotes the length of the upper font.
t denotes the length of the top shell
and the length of the middle line shall be equal to m
m means the middle pole
and b will denote the length of the bottom line
b is therefore the lower field
Now let's find out what these different statements tell us.
So the first statement says that the girl wants to have a top cop.
use the same color wants to have the upper
Police stations less than half a meter from the middle police
So he wants the length of the top font to be
less than half a metre in diameter
We have all the variables in meters so we can write
length of medium font min
12 meters
That's exactly what the orange word tells us.
the upper shelf must be 12 metres shorter than the length
medium font
So what's next?
and the underside shall be:
12 metres less than
double the length of the upper shelf
So it's 12 meters less than twice.
length of upper font
These are both written statements.
using equations
the length of the upper font is equal to the length of the middle font
minus 12
is 12 meters shorter than the average font
and the bottom shelf must be 12 meters shorter than
double the length of the upper shelf
And how do we solve it?
Well, just solve it with these two equations.
we can't, but there's more information in the back.
we have been given here how long each font will be if
devon uses a total of 12 meters of bread
so the length of all the poles must
be together 12 meters
consumption of all
So t plus m plus b must be 12 meters.
These are the length of each of the poles.
and she uses a total of 12 meters of breast
So the total length of the brick must be 12 meters.
So what can we do with it?
but we can all express depending on one variable
So let's say that depends on m, and then let's subtract it.
dependency t on m already expressed
we can substitute all t in the equations
relation m minus 12
but there is b dependent on t
how to express it
Well we know t is equal to m minus 12.
replace all variables t
This expression
that's t equal to
we can rewrite the blue equation as the length of the bottom
the shell is 2 times longer than the length of the top shell
And we know t is equal to m minus 12.
And if we simplify it a little bit, we get
The bottom box is equal to the square root of the two.
2 times m is 2m
2 times minus half is minus 1.
And that's minus 12.
Or we could write it as b is equal to 2 times the length.
medium font minus 32
That's right.
1 is 22 and minus 12 is
minus 32
So now we've all expressed it by m, and we can
all get back
So the top font instead of the t right over here.
without m minus 12
So here we're going to give m minus 12 plus the mean length.
font plus length of bottom font
So we've already expressed it by m.
That's what we just did.
here is the length of the bottom line according to m
So instead of writing b here, let's write 2m minus 32.
plus 2m minus 32 is equal to 12.
All we did was we replaced t
We expressed t by m and expressed b by m
Now let's add all the members with m and the constants.
here we have one m here another and
then we still have 2m here.
And they are all positive.
So 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4.
So we have 4m.
and permanent members
here we have minus 12 and then minus 32.
So minus 12 minus 32 is minus 42, which is
minus 2
So we have 4m minus 2.
And of course it's still true that this is equal to 12.
on one side of the equation we just want to have
unknown
So let's add to both sides plus 2, and let's get rid of the two over here.
on the left
So if we add 2 to both sides of this equation
so on the left hand side will only wake up 4m and these members
cancel out and that's equal to 14.
Now we divide both sides by 4 and we get m is equal to m.
14 divided by 4 is 72 meters because we're counting
in metres
Now we know him, but we still miss him.
what t a b is
Let's do this.
Let's do t.
t is equal to m minus 12
So this is equal to our m is 72 minus 12 and this is equal to
equal to 62 was not 3 meters
we count in meters because we know that
It's in meters.
So the top shelf is 3 meters long.
The middle field is 72 meters, which is the same as 3.
12 metres
And the bottom shelf is 2 times the top shelf.
minus 12
And that's how much
That's 2 times 3 meters. That's the length.
upper font minus 12, which is 6
minus 12 was not 5 and 12 meters
And we're done.
and you can check that the sum is actually 12
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 meters and that's
means that equality is met
the upper font is 12 meters shorter than the middle font
The lower shelf is 12 meters shorter than
double the top shelf
And we're done.
already known length of the shell which
devon needs to make
fill in the table with integers as follows:
to record 430 in five different ways
Think about it a little bit.
this 4 over here we can see as 4 hundred
So four hundred.
And there's 3 over here in place of ten, so 3 tens.
We have four hundred and three tenths.
But it's going to be written differently.
For example, we can only have 3 hundred
We took 100 of the hundreds and now
We can put it in place for tens.
When you take the 100 and put it in place for tens
100 is 10 decimals
Now you've got 10 tens, but you've had 3 tens before.
So you're going to have 13 tens here.
Maybe it seems a little confusing.
Don't forget it's 430.
This is 300 plus 130.
That's still 430.
like you can see as well as 200 plus 230
230 is the same as 23 tens.
the same way you can view it as 100 plus 330
33 tens is 330
It can also be seen as 0 hundreds and 43 tens
43 tens is 430
welcome to talk about the Internet
Which is what you are using
Internet is a big network of connected computers
and by 2014 more than
billion websites
Total billion
It was just a million years ago.
And it's been a lot since.
on what pages we use
initially used
scientists to share their research
for example, the accelerator of the particles
It's just that everyone's using it today, and it's almost anything.
can be written with family via social network
share with other photos
their cute cats
travel portals can plan trips abroad
and to the rapporteurs,
Find out what's going on again.
and then of course it is necessary to use the pages
khan academy for study
So what's your favorite page?
I have a little better question for you, actually.
how you should look like the website you're missing on the Internet..2<en> e.com/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc
maybe a page about you
or something you like
great is that you can program such a page yourself
And you can learn that here at khan academy.
think first about what you want to create
Because you'll learn how to do it soon.
But for the beginning, let's explain the terminology.
What exactly is the internet?
How I said it's a lot
connected computers with websites
when the computer is connected to the internet and provides the website
We call it a server
by English server to serve
the website is written in three languages
html to which page structure is formed
css then edits its view and javascript makes the site interactive
how users see these pages
we use an internet search application for this
for example chrome firefox or internet explorer
we call these applications a browser
viewer tries to view the page as well
but have certain differences
That's why we always say
if an error occurred try using another browser
what browser you are using right now
you need to use this browser on some device
For example, on a notebook with a tablet or smart TV
All of this equipment we call customers
customers can be very different
Some are smaller than others
some have touch screens other keyboards
Some are black
website tries to look good
on all different devices
and what equipment you use
And that's the Internet.
Then his double verse,
There's a lot more we can learn about.
but I think it's time to start writing some html and css
and create your own website
exhale 109
only to repeat if we want to write 109
That would be literally 109 percent, which is the same thing.
as 109 for and now I could rewrite the cent
But we already know.
So 100 literally means 100.
means 109 out of 100
If we had 100 out of 100 we would have one whole
But now we have more than the whole
we have 109 out of 100
we can write it as a ratio or a fraction
is equal to 109 divided by 100
equal to 109 over 100
So let's do it.
Here we have the whole thing we'll be
consider this square as a whole
We've been counting on it in the last video.
It's 4 to 10.
is divided into 100 parts
we want to get 109 of these 100 parts
How it's gonna look
means we're shooting everyone.
100 parts here
I'll make it a new color.
So we're going to pick this whole thing out.
If we chose, we should have 100.
would be 100 divided by 100 or 100 out of 100 or 100
I think you're starting to understand.
I don't want you to just learn to remember
literally that means 100 out of 100 or the whole
So that's the whole square.
It's 100 out of 100 here.
Question 109
We've already done 100 out of 100 but we still have to do another 9.
So let's pick another 9.
So now we have 1 2 3 4 5.
6 7 8 9
This piece right here.
That's exactly it.
It's 9 over the square.
This is 100 squared.
If we take this whole piece and add this blue part to it
we get 109 one
whole quarter
I hope that makes sense.
Let's take a few examples.
Let's take a look at this.
first example
15 out of 40
examples with percentages are dealt with by transferring
percentage of the decimal number that we then multiply
the number from which we want to count the percentage
So 15 times the decimal number is zero. So 15 times the decimal number is zero.
I hope we've already learned that in a video about moving percent to a decimal.
in vision,
And we're going to multiply it by 40.
So 40 times zero is 15 cents.
5 times 0 is 0.
5 times 4 is 20.
Moved Down
write zero
And then 0 times 0 is 0.
1 times 4 is 4.
And we get six zero zero.
write a decimal line
one two
top ten line is not so one two and a line
belong here
So 15 out of 40 is equal to zero over 15 cents times 40, which is equal to 6 over 0 cents.
That's the same thing as 6.
other example
I hope it didn't help you very much.
Now I'll try to confuse you a little bit.
if, however, you are not confused by the previous example
how much is zero the whole of two tenths percent of now figure out the number of seven
Many people are inclined to say that
oh zero the whole of two tens percent is the same as zero the whole of two tens.
If you see it the same way, it's a mistake.
Because we know it's not a zero for two decades.
It's zero, two tenths of a percent.
Think about it in two ways.
I can say that it's zero over two fractures of the stem, which is
if you multiply the reader and the denominator of the ten
Same as two fractures of a thousand.
or use technique when moving
the tenth line of two places to the left
What if we start with zero over two tens and move
the tenth line of two places to the left we get the hopla
oh
hop hop
The decimal line will come here
So that's zero over 2,000.
It's the key.
zero of the whole of two tens of percent is equal to zero of the whole of two thousand.
It can lead you to this mistake I'm making out of ignorance.
But don't be sad if you ever do.
Always shake when you see each other
decimal number and percentage
Now that we've come to write a percentage
as a decimal, we have to multiply the number.
of which we count the percentage
So zero over 2,000 times 7.
It's quite simple.
7 times 2 is 14.
How many numbers do we have?
for the tenth line
count
one two three
So we have to have three numbers per decimal.
So zero over two tenths of a percent of 7 is equal to zero over 14 thousand.
I guess you're saying it's
really small number
And that's right, because zero is a whole two-tenth percent if we think about it.
is less than 1
less than one hundred
And actually, if we're proud of this, the whole two-tenth percent is one-fifth.
And if we count this then one of the five of the seven
That's the number.
It's important to check it out.
It's always good to take a test because
when you work with decimals and percentages
It's very easy to lose in dozens of places.
or make a multiplication of ten
Always take a test
Now I'll confuse you even more
What if I say of what number is four twenty percent?
Of which number
many may lose
take 20
Which is going to be zero over twenty cents.
And I'll multiply it four times.
And that would be a mistake.
Because let's think about it.
I said how much is 20 out of 4 no
I said 20 of some number is 4.
We're going to do some algebra right now.
I bet you weren't expecting it in percentage cases.
Let's say x is the number you're looking for.
And the back says 20 of x is equal to 4.
I think in this way you already know
how to write 20 decimals
zero of twenty cents or zero of two tens
And we multiply this times x to get 4.
20 is the same as zero over two tens.
It's the same as zero over twenty cents, but it's going to be the last zero.
we don't need
zero over two tens times x is equal to four.
And there's a simple linear equation.
I bet you weren't expecting it.
What about it?
two views are possible
we can just divide both sides of this equation.
coefficient u x
So if we divide zero by two tens over here and zero by two tens over here
it turns out x is equal to 4 divided by 0 over 2 tens.
So let's figure out how many is 4 divided by 0 over 2.
Maybe we'll have plenty of room.
zero over two tens is going to go into four. So let's write this tens line over here.
Let's move the tenth line over here.
one place to the right
We get 2 and we have to move the decimal line here.
one place to the right
applies that 02 goes into 4 so many times
as 2 to 40
And that's easy.
2 to 40
2 is 4 times 2.
And to zero, 2 is going to be zero times 2.
2 is 20 times 40.
2 is 20 times 40.
So 4 divided by 0 is 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 out of 20.
And it makes sense.
There's more ways to think about it.
20 is exactly one fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
agrees
For sure we can do a test
find out what 20 of 20 is.
So 20 out of twenty is like zero over two tenths times 20.
And if we count it, we'll get 4.
So we thought the result was right.
try another similar example
I choose the numbers from the bottom
maybe 3 is 9 out of what
again x is equal to the number of which 3 is 9
You don't have to rewrite it like that.
So they knew that zero over nine times x is zero over nine times x is the same thing.
as 9 of x is equal to 3
or x is equal to 3 divided by 0 over 9.
divide by decimal number
So let's write the decimal line.
and several necessary zeros
Move the ten-line right over here by two.
We have to move it in two places and here.
009 goes into 3 so many times
as 9 to 300
9 goes into 30 three times
3 times 9 is 27.
I think I see the pattern.
Thirty-three three times nine is 27.
30 to be repeated
will still be based on 3
based on 3 is 9 of you can also write
333 periodic reports also know that 03
It's actually a third.
So 3 is 9 out of 33 whole and one third
And that's an acceptable answer.
often when we process percentages
looking for only approximate result
precision is not so important here
In this case, but we will be precise.
as in tests and there
where necessary
Maybe it wasn't too fast, and you have a percentage.
good feeling
in case of interest
watch how they are written
if you find 10 out of 100
It's easy.
We just take 10 to the decimal number and multiply it by the stem.
if 100 is 10 of the quantity
It should be noted that this is another example
of which number is 100 10 and when we count
It's going to be a thousand.
Maybe I talked pretty fast when I was counting the percent.
But I hope it didn't help you.
I'll give you some more examples.
Maybe you've heard the concept of a book when people talk about interest rates.
Or they say I'll lend you a few percentage points of money over the pound rate.
listen to the book rate quoted on some financial reporting channels
and this is only the average of interest rates that banks borrow from each other
and is calculated by the British Banking Association
In fact, the thomson reuters are calculated for the British banking association
exists for certain comparisons of other types of securities and financial transactions
and literally means London interbank offer rate
It's in London. It's the rate offered between banks.
London Interbank Tender Rate
to understand this a little bit better, we set up two banks here.
bank and bank b and you may already know
that when you go and save your money to the bank
The bank won't leave all that money.
the way he makes money is that a good amount of money borrows to other people like loans
And they only keep enough money at hand.
These things you know people could actually come and ask for their money from their usual account.
We've got enough.
you can imagine that here and there the bank gets into a situation where it has little cash
or can get close to mandatory minimum reserves
which requires the central bank of the country concerned to have
In these situations, let us say that the bank is getting into such a situation
They said we'd go and borrow some money.
we go and borrow money from another bank
This is an inter-bank loan.
bank b here is paid cash
say we don't want to keep so much cash
we want to borrow it we can actually get interest on cash we don't get interest
the bank b borrows the bank’s money, and
Maybe borrow so much cash.
This is the new cash received by the bank, and
Here's the new cash.
And of course it's a loan.
This is a new loan to settle it. Remember?
that assets are equal to liabilities plus equity
commitments are all here
This is a loan from bank b for this cash
have a little better reserve
and now the bank's credit b has increased and their cash has decreased
This is a bank loan, and
Here they took this cash and gave it to the banks and
and the rate at which they lent it
1 annual rate was required
And of course it's renewed every day, it's a one-day rate.
This rate is an inter-bank rate
on behalf of the British Banking Association
doing research in a number of banks in London
8 12 16 banks in London
They said look at what rate you all trade
and will determine
determine it as a one-day pound rate
they identified it in Greek 12 against all research banks
But what's interesting about the book rate is that it's listed in ten currencies.
It's not just in the barrels of dollars.
Or it's in ten currencies.
That's what separates her from other things.
But it really differs from the actual rate of federal funds, which is the next rate of inter-bank lending.
But it's in the door.
and more subject to political pressure
The Federal Bank is actually trying to change
Good day.
Good day.
Oh, that's a really nice trick.
What's that brand?
Well, it's not a brand, it's a logo of my bottle.
Oh, really?
Do you have a bottle?

Can we get a new market?
But you know, we're in Venice, and that's the advantage: we're close to those markets, Eastern Europe is behind the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will cost us a lot of money!
In the first year they predict a five-year loss.

And today we definitely got new customers.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, we got everyone, everyone needs to sleep well.

It's obviously in the mountains.
No, I'm kidding, we have a real city other than Vienna.
