Before I really start, I want to give you a overview of the largest Austrian municipalities.
You can see the municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, and from 2,000 to 11 we are entitled to audit all these municipalities.
The threshold was twenty thousand before.
So the gray dots have more than twenty thousand inhabitants and the blue have less than twenty thousand.
The explanations are still in German.
I'm sorry.
In total, we are therefore entitled to examine 75 municipalities.
These are about three points and two percent of the total amount.
But we advise all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, we in our department have decided to develop a special tool, which we call a community monitoring tool.
The development team in our department consists of three young economies, and I am one of them.
And we three all use the instrument for different purposes.
What was the purpose of this instrument?
The main reason was to find an analytical tool for the financial risk assessment.
So first, we're trying to create a profile for every community.
We take into account all relevant factors.
In the second step, we are evaluating the communities as to their importance for the audit activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we classify the municipalities according to certain indicators according to the financial risk.
Appointment is always the interesting method, the most interesting part of all history, because we can compare all communities.
Thank you.
The biggest challenge for each database project is to collect data of good quality.
We've heard it before the day.
In this context, we would like to use the data of the Federal Statistical Office Austria, the Austrian Statistical Agency, which represents our main partner in this project.
And we get the following data...
Where these data are actually open to every citizen
But you have to buy it from Statistics Austria if you want the aggregated data.
And only aggregated data are useful for analysis.
So we have the inter-sector accounts according to the budget and the accounting rules.
We have detailed information about the closed accounts so that we have the accounts at the free-card level.
And we have exposures of debts and liabilities.
We mainly use financial and accounting data, but of course we have securities settlement systems data separately. We have population figures and other data derived from Austria's statistics.
What we have is the data from the time of two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen.
Oh, that's a mistake. Excuse me.
And we keep updating this data every fall.
Since we take the data from the accounting systems of the municipalities, we do not have data on community contributions, no data on leasing obligations and no data on sales and assets, as the municipalities do not perform this data.
This is an important point, since in practice, if you go to the community and agree with the official accountant, you will find the number of debts, and if you pursue the body or community contributions, you can do so.
Based on the data available, we assume that our indicators of good distribution, which I will explain later on, can develop an indicator model, and this monitoring is based on a model that consists of indicators.
And there's a statistic going on between one and a hundred that's going to be relevant to the next test.
This model therefore allows the use of indicators by specific themes.
In order to establish the relevance of the audit, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses the indicators for the financial situation as a basis, but depending on the question raised and the question to be examined, another indicator may be used.
And then you get another result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four themes, and the first is the long-term financial situation.
In other words, we assume the net debt in addition to the liabilities with respect to securities and reserves.
So the first one gives us the long-term perspective, i.e. debts against assets.
And the second issue is the short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we define the core ldo, i.e. the current revenue without transfers in respect of current expenditure without transfers and pensions.
This is an important point in the indicator model, as we do not apply the figures I have expressed per head.
We apply a different number, and this is the actual income as a relevant number, as it is better able to show the economic power of the community.
The next item is the administrative structure.
Because we're just putting together the administrative and personnel costs.
The last one was the biggest challenge for us.
We have tried to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And yes, we take into account other accounts, the other accounts, the representation costs and the analysis of special accounts.
That means we're trying to find accounting errors with these data.
This slide is a screenshot of a possible release of the monitoring tool
And you can see the listed communities from the best to the worst community.
The black column gives us the value and refers to the importance of the audit activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors, and it is therefore classified in this picture according to the relevance of the audit for our department.
So the four columns on the right give us the indicators.
I explained the indicators of the model earlier.
And the black column gives us the value of three and thirty commas, which is the municipality of Hallwang, a small community near Salzburg, and this is the best community.
That means it's a judgment.
So if we want to look at a community with the best financial situation, we'll look at Hallwang.
If we like to test the worst, we just jump over the picture and take the last one, but today I don't want to show you these communities.
And we have all the Austrian congregations in our system, but not every community falls under our jurisdiction, so that only the second, yes the second, can be audited by us.
And we're trying to compare the municipalities with the same size, so we don't compare Vienna with Hallwang, so we're looking for similar communities, so it's a fair comparison.
So we have many different representation possibilities of the search results of this instrument, and another feature is this diary for each community.
Here we have, for example, the municipality of Hallwang.
We can create such a diary for each municipality of Austria, and as you can see, you will probably not be able to read it, but we have a lot of numbers, indicators, graphs and information.
Another feature of the diary is these two pages. For example, you can see the analysis of personal tasks on the left, this is the red line of the diagram.
And compared to the other municipalities, you can choose the blue line and where the red line exceeds the blue line, the municipality is worse.
Or
So you can easily assess whether the municipality has excessive spending.
So on the right hand side, we have the references, which means that we have the outgoing and the detailed money in a community perspective.
These two expenditure, however, are only two of many.
We are now using some statistical programs like R Stat Plus and are able to perform any analysis that is necessary or required by our predefined.
As you can see, we use this tool for audit planning, for preparing, for the operational level and on request, i.e. if anyone is only allowed to attend a presentation in the municipal administration, he/she/she/she can
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in a region, we can do this, and this information does not only help us in the examination itself.
And in accordance with our advisory approach, we provide the community with the specific Fact Sheets.
In other words, if the mayor wants to call us and know what his municipality looks like and what the financial situation in this community is like, we can give him a Fact Sheet and a diary.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
Marcus, are you online, can you hear us?
Should I start?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Ha ha ha ha, sorry.
First of all, thank you for inviting me to speak at your e-data conference.
