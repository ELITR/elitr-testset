Access to government information is a democratic fundamental right.
And this role requires the government to provide public information.
Since the entry into force of the law, society has changed very much.
And information is no longer stored on the paper, but stored in dynamic computer systems.
And now virtually everyone is connected to the Internet via a number of devices.
And the 21st-century government can respond to these challenges by providing direct access to government information to the public.
In other words, the government can actively publish open data.
The volume of open data cannot be seen separately from the transition to digital administration.
And here the United Kingdom and the United States present the pace.
They understand that the open data is clearly not an objective, but a means of becoming transparent.
And in the open government partnership, they are global leaders.
An initiative to encourage the government to be as open as possible.
There are several European directives and treaties in Europe, which are important for the legislation and policy of open data.
And the Dutch government has open data ambitions and policies.
However, the actual implementation is still at the beginning of an early stage.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former President, Saskia J. Stuiveling, saw the great potential for open data.
And in two thousand thirteen we have decided to monitor the progress of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We conducted a survey of the use of open data ministries.
Our approach is positive, because we are referring to ministries that cut off well, and we have tried to encourage the ministries that have fallen behind.
Through meetings with experts and officials for open data and through the publication of fact sheets with good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we stressed the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have recognised several potential benefits from open data.
Open data provide the government with good opportunities.
And by opening up data about their spending and services, the government gets a better understanding of its own funding.
In this way it shows how Parliament is reviewing the government.
For citizens, the collections of open data would make the government more transparent and accessible.
From a business point of view, innovative entrepreneurs can use open data in new applications.
One of our objectives was to determine what the Netherlands can learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Using data for the biometer with open data from the World Web Foundation, we compare three aspects of open data.
The awareness to ensure positive results from open government data initiatives.
The extent to which open data are available.
And the impact on society, economy and government.
Society, Economy and Government
And if we have compared...
I'm sorry.
I'll get my voice back to the monitor.
That's very disgusting.
O.K.
But let's go on.)
If we compare the United Kingdom and the United States with the Netherlands,
We can see that the United Kingdom and the United States are cutting down better with regard to implementation and impact.
There are hardly any differences in the availability of open data.
If we look at the readiness, the Netherlands is less good at cutting off.
Only with regard to the right of information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the UK and the United States publish open data much more than the Netherlands.
The number of open data collections in the United States is enormous.
The type of data published by the countries depends on the number of points.
The Netherlands is currently publishing only a few open data on public expenditure and public procurement.
The Dutch trade register is also not open.
As you can see, the United Kingdom has open data on all policy areas.
The impact of open data can be divided into political, social and economic dimensions.
And the Netherlands remains in the social and economic dimensions of the shows behind the UK and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in the design and review of government policy.
Companies generate only little added value with open data.
In our two reports, we have added international examples that can serve as a good example for the Netherlands.
In Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on waiting times for hospitals.
We didn't just leave on open data barometers.
And we've been looking for ourselves.
And to get a better picture of the volume and the type of open data currently available,
we have seen the data published on our national open data portal.
A total of 3,000,200 collections of open data were available in February for 2,000 and 15,000.
And something more than half of the data collection is provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by the central government is produced by the Ministry of Infrastructure.
The Ministry of Public Works is the main source of open data in the Netherlands.
For our two reports, we have asked all the ministries what measures they are taking to publish open data.
The number of points we assigned to each ministry was based on six indicators.
For example, support for an action plan from the top and by persons of the Ministry.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have taken extraordinary initiatives to publish open data.
We have also asked the ministries how many people and how much money they have provided in two thousand fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice had neither spent time nor money on publishing public data.
However, other ministries have entrusted several persons with the publication of open data and have provided a cost framework for the activities.
And in the conclusions of two thousand thirteen to fourteen, we came to the conclusion that the open data represent a standard but are not yet practical.
And the open data that was collected there are mainly about the government, and rather what the government knows than what the government does.
We have also received a few comments and they rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should provide a greater insight into the available data.
It should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third said that the government must invest both in the supply and demand side of open data.
For example, through the establishment of an open data institution.
For our report of 2,500, we found that the government and the ministries had taken steps to increase the acceptance of open data.
In part, in response to our first report on open data, the Ministry of the Interior is currently coordinating a government-wide data set analysis.
The Netherlands therefore follows the good examples of the United Kingdom and the United States.
There was also a turning point for days.
We found that the open data provided via the national portal was unique.
Almost all collections of open data are geodata, geographic data, and almost all are published by a Ministry.
There are only very few important data available that are important for public control of public finances and government activities.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following should be taken into account in the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch Government should therefore define objectives and milestones in a specific action plan.
And we also think that opening data should be mandatory.
And the government should build a national information infrastructure.
This platform should determine which data are of the greatest social importance and which data should be open in any event.
And the government has to use open data itself, for example when it comes to decentralization in the social field.
This is a major national programme in the Netherlands, in which the responsibility of the central government is transferred to the municipalities.
Our reports were positive.
The Ministry of the Interior will publish the results of a government-wide data collection this month.
And the House of Representatives accepted the request for a national information infrastructure.
On the basis of the data file, the Ministry of the Interior will establish a national agenda for open data.
And in this agenda they will publish what data will be opened and when they will be opened.
We are also trying to set an example.
We have published our own expenditures on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors spends its money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open budget.
And the Ministry of Finance has now planned to open up detailed government spending data next year.
O.K.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is increasing and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to make progress.
Thank you for your attention.
And if you are interested, you will find our reports in English and our expenditure data in Dutch on our website.
