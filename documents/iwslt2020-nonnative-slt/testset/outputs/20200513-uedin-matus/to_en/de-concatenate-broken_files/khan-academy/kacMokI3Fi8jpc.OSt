So it literally means
109 per 100
If it were 100 per 100 then we would have it all but
Now it's more than a whole
we have 109 per 100
We can write that as a relationship or a break
That's the same thing as 109 per 100.
It's the same as 109100.
So let's do this.
So here we have a whole
this square is a whole
in the last video we have counted
That's a 10x10square.
it is divided into 100 pieces
So if we want 109 of this piece
What does that mean?
It means that we all
Take 100 pieces here
I'll take a new color.
So we're going to screw this up.
If we only punish these, we have 100.
100 or 100 per 100 or 100
I think you know what I want to do.
I just want you to understand.
that really means only 100 out of 100 or from a whole
And as we can see, this is the whole square.
That's exactly 100 out of 100.
now we should delete 109
we already have 100 per 100 missing 9
So let's multiply 9.
So let's go, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
eight nine
So this piece here has what we see.
exactly
That's 9 of a whole square.
this is 100 of a whole square.
When we angle this whole square and the blue pieces over there
over here, we'll see 109 of one.
Quadratic geese
I hope that made sense.
start with a few tasks
1 task which is 15 percent of 40
I solve percentage data by
Convert the percentage to a decimal number and then multiply by the number
Of which I want the percentage
