When I was a kid, we only had a million.
And we thought we were cool.
what we do websites for
to share websites used at the beginning of the researcher
their research as on high-energy accelerators
But now everyone's using it for pretty much everything.
Maybe they're using a social network to talk to their family.
a photo website for the exchange of photos
their skins and cuts thereof,
a travel website to decide where to go on an exotic trip
or a news website to find out
What is going on in the world
and of course they must use
learn the khan academy website
So what's their love website?
Actually, I have a better question.
which website they want to exist but not yet
maybe a website about itself
Or something they love
the cool thing is you can program a website yourself
And they can learn how to do it here at khan academy.
start them brainstorming what they want to do
For they will be in the lowest place, doing it early enough.
let us first make sure a little bit and disable some concepts
what is the web exactly
Now as I said it's a bundle of
connected computers that have pages
if a computer is connected to the internet
and spurred a website out we call that computer a server
because they serve on the website of the
a website is written in three languages
html to mark web content
css for the styling it
and javascript to make it interactive
how users like they actually see these websites
now they use an app dedicated to websitebrowsing
like chrome firefox or internet explorer
and we call these applications browser
browsers try to show everything elbe website in the same way
But they have their differences because
we sometimes say hoppla there is a problem with this browser
try another
which browser they are using right now
Now they have to be with that browser
Of a kind of device like a laptop
smartphone tablet or also a smartphone
and we call these devices customers
customers can be quite different
Some are smaller than others
some have touchscreens others have keyboards
Some are black and white
So websites have to try to work well
in all types of clients
which client they are currently using
And this is the way
Now the two-minute session
It's about learning a lot more about the road.
But now I think it's time to start writing them
some html and css make them their own websites
Paragraph 109
if we write 109
then it's literally 109 percent and that's the same thing as
109 per cent and now I could write again, but that
we already had
