So 15 is equal to 015.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
And then we multiply this number by 40.
So 40 times 015.
5 times 0 0
5 times 4 20
Place a 0 here
1 times 0 0
1 times 4 4
equals 6 0 0
And they are numbered of them.
one two
no decimals here that equals one two
And the same place is coming here.
So 15 of 40 is the same thing as 015 times 40 and that's 600.
And 600 is equal to 6.
Now the next task
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's going to be a little more complicated.
what is 02 percent of 7
many are deceived, and
think 02 is the same as 02
But that's wrong thinking.
Because that's not 02.
This is 02
you can imagine that on 2 different ways
first road 02 divided by 100 the percentage means as much as divide me by 100
then count and multiply by 10
So this is going to be 2 divided by 1,000.
the 2 away is the komma disk technology
this is just going to be about two stitches to the left move other countries using a point like this
So let's start with 02.
and go 2 set to the left
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
So 2 times left
Then this is the decimal.
which will then be 0002,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
This is the technique
02 is equal to 0002
this error can easily happen to everyone
Why don't you take it so tragically when it happens?
So always be careful if
and meet
Now that we know
what 02 as decimal number is visible 0002
we still have to multiply it by the number of times we want to know the percentage
So we multiply 0002 by 7.
That's easy.
7 times 2 is 14.
And how many of them do we have in sum?
And how many of them do we have in sum?
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
That's one two three.
So we need to put one two three behind the decimal.
So 02 percent of 7 is equal to 0014.
young young man who looks like a pretty small number
young young man who looks like a pretty small number
And that makes sense, because when you think about it,
is 02 even less than 1 percent
And that's even smaller than a hundred.
and 02 is 1500
And when you calculate 7,500, you get to this number.
And when you calculate 7,500, you get to this number.
And it's important to do that.
It's always good to make a reality test
when this man counts the same and the percentages
It's easy to lose a factor 10 there or there.
or to be won
therefore always make a reality test to see if the result can be right
And it will be more confusing.
Next task 4 is 20 percent of which number
many think reflexively
I take 20 percent.
so 020
And multiply it by 4.
And that would be wrong thinking again.
warum
the task is not what are 20 of 4
the task is 20 of a given number is 4
We need some algebra now.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
x is this number
So the function is 20 of x is 4.
Now the task will perhaps become somewhat more transparent
what is 20 as the same number
is 020 or 02
And multiply this by x to get 4.
So 20 is the same thing as 02.
And that's the same thing as the 020 without the last zero.
which has no further meaning here
02 times x is equal to 4.
And now we have a linear equation of first degree
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
now there are 2 possibilities
you can divide both sides by the coefficient of x
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
So divide the left side by 02 and also the right side
And so you get x is equal to 4 divided by 02.
Now let's figure out what 4 is divided by 02.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
how often 02 goes into 4
to calculate this
Move the dot point to the right
So we get a 2 here.
And move it right over here.
So 02 fits kind into 4 who
2 in 40 fit
simple
2 fits as often in the 40
in 4, the 2 fits twice.
in 0 the 2 matches zero times
that goes in the head too
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
So 4 is divided by 02 is equal to 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 percent of 20.
makes sense
This can be viewed differently
20 percent is exactly a fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
that fits
for safety, we can check that again.
take 20 of 20
20 of 20 is equal to 02 times 20.
if you calculate this, the 4
so we checked the result
Let's do another exercise.
I choose the numbers randomly
here the task 3 is 9 percent of which number
again algebra x is the number of 3 is exactly 9 percent
You don't have to write that down.
Now we know 009 x means 9 percent of x.
So 9 percent of x is equal to 3.
or x is equal to 3 divided by 009
Now we run the division by 009 goes as often as in 3
We're going to make a decimal here.
I still don't know how many zeros we need.
I move the decimal two times to the right
I'll do that on the right.
So 009 fits exactly as often as 3 as
9 in 300 fit
in 30 fits 9 three times in
3 times 9 is 27.
it already looks like a pattern
30 3 times 9 is 27
you always get 3 3 3
forever and ever 3 3 3
the result is now 3 is 9 percent of 333
333 period dh the three never listen to 3333333
03 period as 0 033333 is the same as 13
So 3 is 9 percent of 33 and 13.
both answers are correct
and often you want to calculate the percentage
actually only have a rough estimate
precision is not always the most important
But in this case, we are precise.
and obviously you have to work in class and test
be very precise
I hope it wasn't too fast and a certain
Percentage fee generated
important in this kind of tasks is to be closely observed
how the problem is formulated
if it means 10 percent of 100
That's easy.
You just have to convert the 10 into a decimal number and multiply it by 100.
but if the formula is 100 is 10 percent of which number
then you have to remember that this is another problem.
in this case 100 is 10 percent of and if you calculate that
comes out 1000
I think in this module we had a great tempo
And I hope it wasn't too confusing.
But I'll take more of it.
Maybe you heard the concept of libor when people talk about phrases.
Or they say hey I'll lend you money a few percentage points over libor
You will hear libor in a few of the financial markets
what it really is is is just the average value of the interest rates in which banks borrow mutual money
and this value is calculated by the British bank association association association of the British banks
