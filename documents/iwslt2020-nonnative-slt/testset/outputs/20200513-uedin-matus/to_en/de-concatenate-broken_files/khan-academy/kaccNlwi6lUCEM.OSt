So we have the question devon will depend 3 times for
It has a piece of wood that is 12 feet long American size unit
She wants the top width to be a half foot shorter than that
I'll show you this in another color.
She wants the top width to be a half foot shorter than that
Let's just read the whole text first.
the underside breadth shall be half a foot shorter than the double length
I'll show you this again in another color.
the underside breadth one half foot shorter than twice the
how long each width must be if it
let's define a few variables for our different width
Because that's what we need to find out.
we have the upper width the middle width
let's say t the length of the top top width is t for
then we make m the length of the middle width
m for medium
And then we take b for the length of the bottom
width this is b for bottom angle bottom bottom
Let's see what the various information exhibits give us.
So the first view is that the top width
I take the same color as the top width t
a half foot shall be shorter than the median width m
So she wants the length of the top width t
It's like a half foot shorter than the middle width.
If we count everything in foot then we get
the length of the middle width in foot minus
So that's what the orange set means.
the upper deck must be 12 feet shorter than the longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal longitudinal
Okay what the next exhibition means
and the bottom width b must be
equal to 12 feet shorter than
twice the length of the upper width t
So b is 12 feet shorter than twice the
Now we have written two exhibitions as
the length of the upper width shall be equal to the length of the middle width;
So the top width is 12 feet shorter than the middle width.
and the bottom width must be 12 feet shorter than
how do we solve this
you can't solve the equations yet with just two equations
but we have more information
here is how long all the breeders will be if they
So the length of all the breastplates has to be together.
Because she uses the whole wood.
So t is the top width plus m the middle width plus b the bottom width is equal to 12 feet.
So t is the top width plus m the middle width plus b the bottom width is equal to 12 feet.
it uses all 12 feet wood
So the length of the breadth must be 12.
What can we do now?
we can transform all equations so that they describe a variable
Let's take m and then substitute m.
So t has already been expressed as the function of m
we could substitute everywhere t stands
so m 12 sign
But here we have b expressed in t
how can we write this down only with m
So we know that t is 12.
So wherever we see a t, we substitute
Because that's the same thing as t.
So we can write this blue equation as the length of the
bottom width is 2 times the length of the top width
But we know that t m12
But to make it easier
Let's split it up differently and count the clamps out
2 times m is 2m
2 times 12 is 1.
And then again minus 12.
or we could write this down so that b 2m
minus 32
ok
1 is 22 iminus is still 12
So now we have all expressed depending on m and we can now
So for the top width t let's substitute t
So we have m12 plus m.
plus the length of the bottom width
But that's what we've already expressed in my
just now
This is the length of the lower width expressed in m
So instead of b, we write 2m32.
plus 2m minus 32 is 12.
All we've done is subscribe for t.
we have expressed t depending on m and b also
so now we combine the m equation and the constant term so that
we only have one m here and one m there and
then another 2m there
So all m is positive.
1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4.
So we have 4m.
So what does the constant equation tell us?
we have a negative 12 and then we have a negative 32.
So 12 minus 32 is 42 or so
So we have 4m 2.
And the equation says these 4 times 2 is equal to 12.
So we isolate m on one side of the
Let's count 2 times 2 to both sides to get rid of these 2.
So we add 2 to both sides of the equation.
then stay left only 4,000 left, the two of them up here.
Now we divide both sides by 4 and then we get m is equal to 14 by 4.
Or we could say 72 feet because we're counting
So we have the equation for m solved now
missing t and b
So let's do this.
Let's solve it.
t is m minus 12
So t is equal to our m is 72 minus 12 that's the same thing as
62 or 3 feet
everything is expressed in foot about it we know that
Okay, so the top width t is 3 feet long.
the average is 72 feet which is the same as
And then the bottom breadth twice as big as that
What do we do the same thing?
We're going to put it equal to 2 times 3 feet because that's the
length of the top width and minus 12 that is
And we're done.
you can still check if the lengths together are 12
So 5 12 plus 3 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12.
the upper breadth is a half foot shorter than the middle breadth
And the lower breadth is a half foot shorter than 2
And we're done.
we know the length of the bretter the

Let's think about how we do this.
