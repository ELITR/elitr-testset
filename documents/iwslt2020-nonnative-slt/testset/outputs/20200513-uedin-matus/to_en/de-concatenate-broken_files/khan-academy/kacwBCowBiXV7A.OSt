You can imagine, and again, the cash file of the bank could sink.
or very close to a kind of reserve requirement to impose minimum liability
which the central bank of a country requires the banks
So in this situation we say bank a approaches this situation
They say let me rent some money
Let me rent money from another bank.
This is interbank borrowing interbank credit taking
bank b right here have a lot of cash
So they say we don't want to have so much cash around
We want to rent it so we get zinc we don't get any zinc on barley
So bank b could give a bank a money
So maybe they give so much money.
So that's the new cash the bank got a
right here the new cash
And of course that's a credit.
So a new credit to calculate this reminds you
assets are equal to liabilities liabilities plus equity equity equity
So the connections are the whole thing here.
So it's a credit of b for this bargain.
They now have a bigger security buffer
And now b her loan to a has grown and her cash has fallen
So this is a loan a loan to a
They just took this cash and gave it to bank a
And the price for which they rent it,
maybe it was 1 per year.
and of course it has to be renewed daily it is the overnight rate overnight daily debt rate
this rate of interest is the interbank rate
So what do they do now on behalf of the British bank association?
They go and watch a big bank in London.
eight twelve sixteen banks in London
And they say hey, what was the zinc rate in which you carried out transitions?
And the banks give it to
and this entry is the overnight libor overnight daytime libor
So let's say 12 over all the banks that we've been watching.
But what's interesting about the libor is it's calculated for ten different currencies
not only in British pasta or dollars
or yen but in ten currencies
That's what really differentiated him, among other things.
and really differentiated from the efficiency rate of federal funds rate that is another interbank rate
But it's in the usa.
and this is more about monetary policy objectives
the federal bank central bank of usa is trying to control this actively
