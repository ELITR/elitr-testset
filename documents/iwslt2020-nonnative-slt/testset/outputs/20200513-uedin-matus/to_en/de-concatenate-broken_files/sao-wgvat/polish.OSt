So those of you who were present in Warsaw know what they are looking for.
So I would just like to remind you of a few of these, and then I will tell you about our previous examination in this area and our findings.
The first legislation I would like to mention is therefore a single audit concept.
The implementation of this instrument started three years ago.
But last year was the year of the last phase, because the first phase was that the only audit act was the one that had to be submitted to the tax administration on request.
And now this is an automatic system.
And the information must be transmitted electronically without request.
It shall apply from 1 July of the last year.
This is mandatory for all types of business.
And since 2016.
It was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, small and now for all companies.
I will also come back because we regard it as the most important thing in the fight against VAT fraud.
The second legislation I want to emphasise is the so-called 'fuel package', and this legislation has been gradually introduced again.
It depends on the nature of the company, and the idea is that the licence for the fuel trade will be granted only to those companies that are located in Poland, i.e. all Polish branches of foreign companies, which are located in Poland.
The next legislation is the transport package.
I can say that the draft law was based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this kind was introduced in Hungary, but in Poland we have introduced this system of monitoring the transport of goods only for certain types of goods.
In general, the goods subject to excise duties.
I mean fuel, tobacco and some others, and monitoring means monitoring the transport of these goods by public roads or by rail.
This means that each individual transport must be reported before the start of the transport, in a specific system, a specific system, and also, since last year, any transport is connected to the settlement system.
This is how it is possible to verify each individual truck where it is.
About the roads, the parking spaces, etc.
And the Finance Minister for the Ministry of Finance, who analyses the whole system of mass data, is taught by online, one of the public institutions, and as we now know, they can take many results and some irregularities.
And this year we plan to look at the Ministry of Finance.
As the Ministry of Finance is prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is implemented after the mass tax, that all these units must register all transport, and the system is ready for the purposes of the analysis that is being carried out by the Ministry of Finance.
At the moment, however, we do not know whether the Minister of Finance is using this information for tax administration measures.
The next legislation is something similar to what our technical colleague presented yesterday.
So we have a sort of black list, but in Poland the black list means a list of companies that were sent out of the VAT register.
And we have a system that is based on the information that banks and other entities of the financial system are again making available online.
And this system allows the Minister of Finance to identify any irregularities, and the system aims to collect extraordinary transactions and to provide the tax authorities with online information about them.
Based on this information, the tax administration may close the account, the bank account and the transaction.
What is the risk of an amount exceeding EUR 10000?
The next legislation is the payment entered in the last year.
First of all, this is only an option.
In fact, however, it is an option for the buyer.
If part of the contract uses this, the type and manner of payment for the suppliers is of course required.
And what is important is that, if this mechanism is applied to the split payment mechanism, the taxable person's official liability is excluded.
I will show you a few figures on the use of this payment mechanism in a second.
And the last legislative and organisational instrument that our colleague from the Ministry of Finance has presented quite thoroughly last year.
So we have a new national financial and tax administration based on the previous tax administration, and now we get an administration that unites tax and customs administration in a system.
And an online registration system.
Ha ha ha.
At present, we have the mandatory type of cash register system and the mandatory elements of these registration boxes with the electronic storage.
The tax administration can therefore check the registration boxes based on the storage of the authorized type, but we start with the online registration system only for some sectors.
First of all, we run legal services, medical services, fuels and only a few specific sub-areas.
And that means preparing for the establishment of a central system that will be led by the head of national financial management.
In this system, all these transactions should be registered immediately and simply online.
And so we are discussing the question of how to apply the split payments for all sensitive taxpayers.
This means, in fact, that we want the tax administration to replace the conversion of the tax debtor through this shared payment mechanism as well as official liability.
All sectors in which the conversion of the taxable person or the taxable person's liability is binding could be covered by this shared payment mechanism.
And as I said, I want to say a few words about our examination.
We've done the exam last year.
The period covered by the examination was quite long as it was 12 years; we were asked by the Committee on Public Finance of the Polish Parliament to carry out such an examination.
Our results were as follows.
We had to find that the efficiency of the Ministry of Finance's activities during this long period was different in the subperiods of this year.
In the years 2010 to 2015, we believe that the Ministry and the tax administration have made insufficient efforts to improve the efficiency of VAT revenue.
One of the points of view, as the subject of the audit was the supervision of the Ministry of Finance on tax collection or tax revenue, is the VAT levy.
And one of the indicators for the effectiveness of this surveillance is:
Uh, the VAT gap.
In these years, the VAT gap in Poland was on average 24% and was about 10 points above the EU average.
So this was one of the signs for us that supervision was not effectively conducted.
Yeah, here we go.
It can be said that we have information about the VAT gap in Poland and the EU countries, as we have received the figures from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And as you can see, the average European VAT gap, regardless of the source of information, is definitely lower than in Poland; the figures are quite clear here.
Mmmm.
And as I said, the main instrument in our discovery and tax administration, as well as the view that has taken place in this period, was the only audit document, and in the last two years, the tax administration has been competent.
And for example, in J. 2017, four million accounts were analyzed automatically, but only 30000 warnings were the result of this analysis process.
Last year, the number of accounts analysed was about five million, which is not too high, but there are more than 350000 warnings.
This resulted in an impact on income as the first phase of automatic analysis is followed by the warning sent by SMS or email.
So without any official interference in the tax procedure, etc.
And this system, this first stage, the automatic level, gives us the results in income, VAT revenue of more than 150 million euros per year.
It concerns the last two years 2017 and 2018.
The increase in revenue has taken place under the conditions of a good economic situation and improved VAT collection resulting from the broad package of legislative and organisational changes in recent years.
However, we believe that one of the main sources of these financial results is the implementation of this single audit act.
The results of the other instrument allowing the allocation of payments were as follows: in June 2018, the application of the shared payment mechanism, as I said, was voluntary.
However, we note the increased interest in payments in this form.
In July of last year, the taxpayers made 600 apologies, yes, 600000 transactions.
In December, more than half a million transactions were carried out with the shared payment mechanism.
The value of the taxes paid by this payment mechanism in July was half a billion euros.
On December 1 and a half billion Euros.
Overall, over seven million transactions have been carried out by taxpayers during the period July to December of the last year using the mechanism of paid-up and the tax amount on special accounts for VAT was estimated to be VAT.
And so one more information about the activity of tax administration: Last year, the national tax authorities carried out 30 percent less checks than in 2017, but with less checks, the percentage of controls increased, when compared to 2017.
We believe that this is a result of the introduction of new electronic means that have contributed to identifying the company to be properly selected as an object of control.
The decrease in the number of controls, as I said, has been achieved by a higher number, excuse me, the decrease in the number of controls was accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical investigations.
And it led to a 100 percent increase in inventions in the last year compared to J. 2017.
In our view, in the last few years Poland has been largely time for the implementation of the various laws.
And the overall results are sufficient.
However, we must remember that the economic environment was quite good.
It is therefore difficult to allocate the source of these revenue.
The results of the new organisational and legislative instruments.
And only the results of the general economy.
That's all.
Thank you for your attention.
If you have any questions, we will try to answer them...
Do you have any further questions on your side?
If not, I would ask our Romanian colleagues to continue.
Okay, hello.
Can you hear me?
Yes?
