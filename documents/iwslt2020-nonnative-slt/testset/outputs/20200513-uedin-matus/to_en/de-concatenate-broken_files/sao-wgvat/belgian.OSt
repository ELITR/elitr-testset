We would therefore like to continue and I would ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to present the presentation.
Okay, I'll introduce you to our state of affairs.
We have two national laws to introduce the European regulation of two directives.
The first law deals with paper and digital publications.
You now have the same tax rate,
And under certain circumstances, it's zero, and under other circumstances it's six percent.
For real estate rental we have adopted a financial aid option for renting property of their kind and a mandatory VAT for the short-term rental of property.
Then we did two audits,
One of them is most of what we've heard several times, so I'll be very brief.
The second is for an approved cash register system,
And there are two new four trends.
Therefore our audit of most of the things is not complete,
not yet published. All conclusions and recommendations are only provisional,
But we are very confident that there will be no major changes.
M m.
In our conclusions, there are very similar statements as we have heard today, but for us I would just like to point out a few things that are different, but I think more or less specific to Belgium.
Meanwhile, we only have limited staff in our administration because, in general, we work rather than a recipient than a transferring Member State of identification, and we rely heavily on the other Member States.
But in the future, if most are expanded, we will need more staff and this staff should already be provided and trained.
Another general conclusion that we have made and which we are already hearing more or less is that a change in control policy is being made.
It must be a new way of thinking, but our administration has strong confidence in other Member States in identifying it, because we regard the conclusions as a Member State of consumption.
Just a jump from one pattern to the other.
We see that there is a very bad control policy, so we believe that every Member State of identification sends or transfers the money.
It happens because of us.
However, we have pointed out that it is important to make progress on control policy by creating risk profiles.
So far, our administration has not been able to create a good risk profile as it does not have sufficient data, but it hopes to do so.
I will have more data in the future, and I will make some risk profiles, so we will follow this if the control policy gets better.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We monitor other taxpayers on the Internet, there is a system to find taxpayers over the Internet, but at present the results are worse.
We haven't found many tax matters.
But we'll see.
As the registration procedure of the Member State of identification, it is all right, but not under the circumstances in which the taxpayers are reported.
There are no follow-up measures if they have entered and declared something in the regular system.
So there is no link or follow-up system, which we still think is important.
Then we have something to do with the declaration procedure.
There are some automatic checks that we consider very interesting, but it is not a real check of completeness and accuracy (yes, thank you), but it helps, however, if frequent mistakes are made.
The actual checks must therefore be carried out by the Member State of consumption, but as a Member State of identification, Belgium continues to assist in the fulfilment of the declaration, i.e. certain errors still exist.
A warning is displayed in the system or if you have to make a choice, all options are limited and you can only click on the selected options to make less mistakes.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
As a Member State of consumption, we have also found that this works in the Benelux countries.
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have created a matrix of certain risks and are now developing control activities.
With regard to these risks, there are already two test files that were first launched.
We have therefore recommended that we continue to work in this small group to make progress there and to extend knowledge to European forums.
I think that's the differences we've won from what we've never heard before.
Let's move on with the second audit.
An audit was carried out for the cash register system.
This audit was not carried out by Luden and me, but by other members of the auditorium.
It was also an examination that was much more comprehensive than just VAT, but I will only present the conclusions and recommendations that are important for VAT.
The audit concerned concerned concerned the effectiveness and effectiveness of the control policy.
The installation and application examined two problems related to the registration system.
And the effects of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations concluded that the Recommendation Regulation is too complex.
It was therefore recommended that the Regulation be simplified because the Regulation and the national rules allowed too many exceptions.
Because it was very difficult to determine a particular group solely on the basis of the explanation.
It was therefore also very difficult to monitor or control certain business groups which should install the cash register system.
Another important conclusion is the policy on control.
There are problems with selecting the taxpayers of the cash register system.
Since a threshold has been set, the threshold is applicable, and if the tax declaration is too low, it falls below the fair threshold and there is no control; therefore, it is as if it were a way of doing so.
There was also a problem with cross-checking data from databases for the purpose of selecting taxpayers to check them.
Another conclusion was that there were also bad internal controls for the application of the system.
It was found by the penalties imposed that different control bodies have provided for different penalties.
So there were no rules on penalties, but some control teams were very strict, because the others were not strict at all, or they imposed such penalties, which were far below the rates for certain errors.
It would be a benefit, but it is not implemented now, so the risk analysis was only very elementary and there is no online access, but now we have learned that such a system exists in other countries if they have online access.
They found that this could be a very good advantage.
Moreover, the exchange of information with the National Social Security Office did not work too well.
Therefore, many information was not transmitted to the other party.
Finally, something about the effects of the system.
There was still a problem with the introduction of transactions
So the system as such works very well when it is used as it should be used, but if certain transactions are not entered into the system, they cannot be recognized.
The solution could therefore be to carry out a medical campaign for customers to ask for a disc.
This would therefore ensure that any transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise, it should not be a scheme, but the legislation would be adapted to accept only electronic payments, since it would then be easier to pursue the cash flows.
However, there is no reliable measurement of the management of impacts, so that they have no knowledge of it.
And then our team did some tests and tried to find some effects, but found that there was a preliminary effect here, as the system was delayed for a few years.
But everyone knew that it was going to come, and that is why customers and businesses have already foreseen what laws would change and how the system should be introduced.
It was therefore very difficult to identify and identify the exact differences between VAT revenue before 2016 when the system was introduced.
For a few years before 2016, VAT declarations only increased in view of the expected new system and its changes.
So our team wasn't sure about the result.
This was only about this system or that the effect was even greater because it started earlier than expected.
Look, let me interrupt, I have a problem, and I want to understand it right now.
What do I mean by the term Cash Registration System?
Does this mean that this cash register system is registered somewhere in a database?
No, it's not online, it's a cash, it's a cash.
Yeah, so it's only for cafes, hotels, restaurants.
It's only for a certain branch.
It is currently only available in the HoReCa sector (hotels, restaurants and cafes) and means a system that should register any transaction or register any wedding entered in the system.
There is no online access here.
Therefore, the selection of the control group is very important, as the control teams have to look for different locations.
The control team cannot view the locations online on a computer, but must go to the HoReCas and connect its computer to its registry box.
Then it takes out the data and runs the check.
Yeah, but from the distance it can't do this.
The control team must always go to the premises.
Then and therefore, if a tax declaration is too low and below the threshold.
The teams won't go there just to see if they know the café, for example, and know that many customers are visiting and they haven't been included, but that's just an accident.
But they only found out later, so they'll go.
Thank you very much, Janet, for your question, because I was worried that I was the only one who doesn't understand.
Okay, but what's the difference between this system when you talk about the cash register system for every seller, I mean, in a food business.
So what is the special thing about this special system that we have there?
There is a special software available that determines any possibility of fraud with the system, and this software also ensures that the data can be transmitted to the control team's computer.
On the contrary, using a normal cash register system, you cannot extract the data in the same way.
So this is a cash register system that has a advantage.
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
Yes, there are also other special control instruments, I think there are five different brands of cash registry systems that you can choose from and which have a certificate.
All data that can be extracted into the data formats are suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yes, so compatibility is certified, that is the other part of the main domain.
Yes, you mentioned this risk analysis, there was rather a lack of risk service analysis or it was not done at all.
I mean online access to this analysis or
Online access to the register box itself.
Well, this is what could make the controls much easier, and since we could then carry out automatic checks or extract data.
What could be incorporated into a larger system and the risk analysis was really only very elementary because not enough data was available.
This was also due to the fact that this audit or this system was only introduced in June 2016, so that they could only work with data of two years.
All right, let's get this over with.
I have recognized two new fraud strengths within our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called “marriage”: it was the registration of many foreign companies.
But always through the same two managers, a Russian, a Bulgarian.
But they registered under the names that were very similar to the names already known.
There were only differences in one letter and only to make it credible that these companies exist, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they only gave a VAT declaration and applied for VAT refund on false accounts, but they always submitted this statement in paper form and for very small amounts.
This means that the administration had to include all the information itself in the system, which took some time.
And that is why some refunds were already made before the administration could actually determine that there was a possible fraud and before it could verify whether the company actually existed and whether the company actually existed.
But this kind of fraud has been discovered and the information is being disseminated about Eurofisc, so I think that every tax administration now knows about this kind of fraud.
Another fraud involved eco-ROM certificates that were very similar to the previous CO3-2 certificates.
This was a scheme more or less in the same sense as they sent the accounts.
Or they use accounts on behalf of a firm that is very much like a legal firm that should send the bill.
So we had a scheme that I had very short-lived and didn't take a picture of.
But I would like to explain it that way.
So it was a company A in a Member State X that wanted to sell these certificates to company C through certificates from company B in another Member State A.
Again a company in another Member State Z sends the last company an invoice from an A-with-Shareholders company.
This is also the company with the name that has only one letter difference to the original.
Thus, the company C cannot recognize that there is actually a fraud here.
And of course, it was the company A and the company A with shares representing the same business manager and owning the company A, and the A-with-shareholders company would be the missing dealer.
I hope this kind of schema is clear.
That was the end of my presentation.
