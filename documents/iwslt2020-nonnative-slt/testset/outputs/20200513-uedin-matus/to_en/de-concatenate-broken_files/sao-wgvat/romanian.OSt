In Romania, the nineteen percent of the VAT we have had in the last two years remains.
And although there was a plan to cut it to eighteen percent, it was postponed earlier.
We also have two reduced VAT rates, nine percent and five percent.
And last year, there were some changes to the products that could have the reduced rate.
The biggest change occurred in the wastewater sector, which was reduced from nineteen to nine per cent from the first January of this year.
The others stayed the same.
And at the five percent rate there were a little, a lot of changes, mostly some of the products that were at nine percent were reduced to five percent.
The biggest and the last was from the first of June of this year in terms of quality high quality food, mountain products and equivalent and traditional products.
And for that, the products must be seen on a mountain, or how the cows or sheep live at least half of their lives there.
And the manufacturer must approve a certificate from the Minister for Agriculture.
Thus, it can apply the reduced rate.
Next, we have the reverse tax mechanism.
In Romania, both companies must be registered for application purposes.
There are fourteen products for which the rate can be reduced, and in December 2018 the deadline for some of them was extended to twenty-two.
Finally, we also have the shared VAT system, which was introduced in June 2017, although it now seems a little abandoned by the Ministry of Finance.
Since it started with more than four hundred companies in 2017 and now in 2019 the figure has fallen to sixty-four percent.
As no new companies have used the system since 2018.
That is why all the companies that have started to set up the system and have returned to the normal VAT system.
In addition, the European Commission has allowed Romania to no longer apply this system.
So it looks as if it hadn't achieved its potential, so the Ministry would probably set it up.
All the time?
This is derived from the data we have, I think, because no new companies were registered in J. 2018 and nothing was registered in J. 2019.
So only the companies that started in J. 2017 remain in the system, and their number is slowing down.
In all these findings, there are still some regulatory failures with regard to the MOSS system, which in Romania means, for some reason, M1SS, as it was translated.
But so was it.
And there are also shortcomings in the IT systems in the tax departments that work together and exchange data.
This does not make it easier for companies, and last year they have finally used an electronic machine, a similar machine as in Belgium.
They set up the electronic registers, and the companies are now obliged to use them, as the tax authorities are coming and checking that all the registers have been installed.
But at the moment we are not really sure if the system is fully functional because the IT system has limitations on the part of the Steuerbeh√∂rde.
And no new trends have been identified so far.
So that's it.
Thank you very much.
