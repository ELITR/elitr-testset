Since we only have the answer in English, this is only a formality and the examination is now over.
The title was "Many of the Challenges ..." and this special report reads "Many of the challenges in collecting VAT on duties still need to be solved".
They still have to be solved.
It was originally ‘still to be treated’, but to some extent they were addressed by new Commission legislation and new proposals, which just mentioned <CENSORED>.
But there are still the problems that need to be solved, and we will see later.
So I start with why we chose this subject for the audit.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
We will complete our recommendations.
First of all, we conducted a survey as we follow the previous research analysis.
Based on the findings of the chair of this post in the field of e-commerce, there were some audits by German colleagues and Lithuanian colleagues.
In a report on imports previously identified, we analysed the problem of the removal of non-EU countries and the problems associated with them in terms of VAT and duties and decided that it would be worth it during this review.
The problem is that honest traders are often excluded from the market by unfair traders and cannot compete anymore.
This is a problem that has also been addressed by a scientist such as Professor Rita de la Feria and which is particularly intense in the UK.
Estimates of losses too.
There are only estimates of the distance from non-EU countries.
These estimates are not very encouraging, however, as the Commission has only proposed five billion a year, but in the UK there are between one and a half billion pounds a year.
You've estimated these losses.
This corresponds to between 8% and 10% of the UK VAT reduction.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently accounts for only four percent.
So we have the triple amount of fraud in the UK, which represents the loss of electronic trade in goods purchased from non-EU countries.
So that's an order.
We do not count on intra-EU TV sales, we do not count on most electronic services here.
So this is about expressing our concerns.
Then, of course, we look at five Member States – Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we have most often taken into account the number of registrations in MOS in both non-EU and US systems.
The volume of intra-EU e-commerce sales and, ultimately, the estimated amount of VAT that is due to the low value of Simon's release.
After examining our source by the Commission, we have also visited the Commission.
These actions should debug the technology and the World Customs Organization, and the period of time spent ranged from 2,500 to the end of 2,000 eighteen.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal submitted and all the proposals that will enter into force in 2021.
What are we talking about?
Of course, we have begun to analyse the answers to our survey sent by the second core group.
We continue with the questionnaire in all the Member States that we have visited with interviews with all possible people.
We have received access, and this is also very important, to have set up an ABC data access to the synergy database, the database with incidents and problems reporting the data from the Member States in the MOS.
We have access to all fiscal project groups and electronic groups on e-commerce and all related project groups, so that there is a lot of information and discussions on the functioning of the MOS system.
And of course, we have received funding from the institutions of Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally we have carried out our own samples of various transactions.
Overall, we have examined almost nine hundred transactions in connection with e-commerce.
What we find here, of course, are the first positive things and then we will continue to work with the most negative things.
The legal framework follows the international best practices of the OECD and the World Customs Organization, which show extremes.
In most aspects of the OECD, the principle of taxation at a destination has been respected in the majority.
There is now a new threshold of less than ten thousand euros that you can report to the home Member State, which does not comply with the OECD rules.
For the World Customs Organization dealing with the imported packages, the directives on immediate release have been followed in most respects, and this also applies to the new proposal for the standard framework.
The Commission adopts this proposal as a priority and agrees in many respects with the World Customs Organization and with the standards.
For the new regulation to be introduced in 2021...
I intend to address some of the weaknesses, but for us the main problem that will continue to arise is underevaluation.
We are experiencing losses from VAT and duties and will thus continue to do so.
This cannot be done by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As far as trade with non-EU countries is concerned, this will not be resolved and we will see why later.
Why, yes, because administrative cooperation with non-EU countries does not work?
We have a new agreement with Norway.
We expect an intact exchange of information with Norway, but that is not a problem.
It is not Norway, the problem is China, it is the United States.
The information chain with China is not working because the Chinese side is not responding and the percentage of responses is still falling, so that makes a real problem.
If we have information about the supplier exchange that does not work via an electronic interface, i.e. he works directly on his website, which is mostly not registered or even registered, and then we cancel the registration, and then we cancel the registration.
What is it like to pay the VAT from Europe to China, and we expect VAT to be reimbursed to the EU.
If we do not have administrative cooperation.
This will never happen.
This is also a problem between the EU countries where it does not work as expected.
Administrative cooperation, as we will see later, and the checks carried out by the national tax authorities are also weak.
Therefore, there are practically no instruments to carry out a proper risk analysis of an opportunity, as has already been mentioned.
It is also necessary for the Member State to agree with the Commission's proposal to exchange information with payment service providers, while payment service providers controlled by the Commission are not sufficient.
And we will see later that the Commission had not carried out any monitoring, no monitoring.
There are also difficulties in the customer-specific electronic customs processing systems.
The traditional problem is, of course, that traders underestimate the goods so that prices are below the two, twenty or ten-year threshold for VAT.
And this will fall away in the future, but they will continue to underestimate the goods in order to pay less VAT.
It is not accepted, but they will pay less, and with regard to customs duties, the adoption is set at EUR 100.50 and cannot be achieved.
Thanks to all the electronic support we can look forward to an EU electronic customs clearance system that does not stop the customs declarations.
If an e-customs office is affixed to the relevant field, he/she shall electronically apply for the exemption of customs duties for the customer.
And it will be better to apply the system even if a value is declared that is more than fifty-one.
The electronic system cannot stop them from saying that, and that is something very serious, because the operators that work there are hopeful economic participants.
So, the great couriers, they have an authority for economic operators and they propose to be the most reliable, but they abuse the system.
A compulsory levy of VAT and customs duties is not effective.
O.K., the provisions for the information chain on claims relating to this tax.
They are rarely used by the five Member States we have visited in Austria.
Only on five occasions, so they are not often used.
There are inconsistencies in the payments between the Member States we have analysed.
We have access to the vote held by the Commission and there are still no meetings.
Much is important between Member States.
There is obviously a problem in the Netherlands that they are not in a position to bring the VAT amounts received into line with VAT declarations.
And there are also problems with the payment certificates that our fellow Members of the NKU discussed yesterday.
They alleged a problem with the payment certificates from Member States of consumption that were not processed.
Here is the summary of our findings on the MOS sample.
We have come to the conclusion that the MOS IT infrastructure is suitable for its purposes and is so strong.
The user can handle this, so the IT infrastructure is strong, but there are problems with registration and payments between Member States.
For example, we analysed the incidence reported in the synergy database between Member States, but in the five Member States there are only a few 22 cases.
We then examined in which Member State the problem has already arisen and how the Member State is affected.
There were only twelve cases, so not too many cases, but the problem is that the attitude of the Member States was really passive.
Only when the problems escalated, they began to work on it, but it took a long time until the problems were resolved.
As far as MOS is concerned, it takes away long periods, but there are not many problems.
In the case of technical errors sent and received between the Member States, responsibility is very passive and not proactive until the problem is extended as an incident, they begin to react.
But the infrastructure is robust for the MOS.
We haven't checked if they're ready for the only plant.
This is another thing that we have received some complaints, particularly from Austria.
They say they are not ready, even from the Dutch path that we have not analysed, because the system is specifically developed for customer-specific purposes by using only one plant for import.
There is a problem with registration here.
We need to distinguish between the non-US system and the EU system, where only eighty percent of registration applications have not been properly checked.
As far as the knowledge of the non-US system is concerned, we have even identified cases of double registration, which is something of a disadvantage, then the problem of the Member State's deficiencies in payments is, in particular, the problem of the Member State's deficiencies.
And sometimes also in the Member State of identification.
Further problems with registration and cancellation of registration.
This concerns in particular administrative cooperation, i.e. the exchange of information between the Member States we visited.
And if we compare the overall activity of the information networks here, we can see that, for example, the total need for information sent for one hundred and twenty-two is compared to the total need for information.
Not related to the average in general are ninety-two thousand, so that not even many in the UK are even more problematic, for example three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is sometimes good, sometimes very low, some Member States have not changed anything and there is no reason to do so; we recommend having a separate, centralised CNO Home Office.
A tight structure that is determined by the IT business or at least by the MOS, so that the level of information transmission is very weak.
Then we have the multilateral controls, there were six cases of multilateral controls in two cases.
That was a really successful experience.
In two cases, however, this was not at all successful, as the Member State of identification refused to participate in multilateral control.
This is intended to be resolved through the implementation of the new legislation, as two Member States can now request the implementation of a control.
And then there is another recent challenge to the other Member State of identification that it should not refuse participation.
Hopefully we will see improvement, but there are other things that are important for Eurofisc.
There were forty-four signals to Eurofisc that a chain is full of e-commerce trade, and only a feedback to these forty-four signals.
So the Member State did not find this information very useful, they do not know why they were selected, since only five Member States have included the seniors in the database.
And the others didn't read it because they didn't find the information very useful.
There is also a signal formation on fraud issues, three or four issues which they considered useful.
And then there are various tools of a self-employed web-crawler tool, but this is something that only some members in their countries use legally.
In other Member States, domestic legislation prevents the use of web crawling tools.
This is why the work files are frozen and the frozen activities are no longer useful.
They are awaiting the proposal of the information chain between payment service providers.
That's why they want to have a database and access it.
This is the Commission's proposal on all information supplied by the payment service provider from other countries.
Of course, we support the proposal very much and add it to the report, but I did not know that the Commission itself needs support for this proposal, because now that I have not asked for it yesterday, Lubik Lubis said that
In the Council, however, I am of course in favour of this proposal, because it comes from a number of discussions in some forums with Member States and with stakeholders.
Hopefully this is very important, because there is another problem: the lack of controls and audits for MOS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here, there's no reason for that, because I can't do anything like that if I don't know, I don't have a regional analysis.
So my audit will be based on a random selection and will probably contain a lot of information and no records, because some data is needed, and this is the data.
In addition, the company will need a lot more applications.
Yes, it's Germany, they understand it because we have the data.
Not an American team, but the information might be available to him.
A phenomenon.
But I don't know, and still, there's practically no control.
The inspections of knowledge of distance within the EU were also not very successful.
That is why we have at customs the results of the sample per courier from the postal use.
In order to address the question of undervaluation, the main problem in the post offices, they have very expensive drones here, which have been declared under ten units or at twenty-two euros.
Try them a thousand times easier.
And they can read and it's very difficult to create this at the level of a post office.
And for the couriers it is easy to abuse the duty exemption of fifty-one, because they simply tighten the box for the takeover and then don't close the fifty.
In order to stop the explanation, although the depreciation is more than fifty-one, we will not only check this in the sample, but also directly in the electronic customs system in the dampened environment where we have made some attempts.
It has not worked in any Member State, it only works in Austria.
However, it was not accepted in Austria.
We have introduced another explanation for alcohol.
And then it was applied to alcohol, and because this category is applicable to alcoholic products.
There are also some errors in the Austrian system.
Another problem is that the approved economic operators and the most reliable customs dealers abuse the system.
Then we have a recommendation for the Commission to take advantage of the structures provided for in the Treaties on mutual assistance with non-EU countries.
In order to address the problems, a lack of answers must be identified.
To carry out inspections in the Member States relating to local reductions.
Monitoring the functioning of telecommunications within the EU, the minimum, the only operator; this recommendation is the only one not accepted by the Commission.
That's why you succeeded yesterday because you're still on duty.
The Commission is monitoring and <CENSORED 22:25> said, "Yes, yes."
I did it, but OK.
They support Member States in the development of a methodology for estimating the VAT gap in newcomers.
Since this is a problem, we cannot know whether or not the system works.
It is assumed that the system is mostly successful, but this is usually an acceptance, and that is why we have an estimation of most VAT gaps.
We do not know for sure whether the system is successful, and for EU internal trade itself we do not have an estimate, so that would be very important.
What the Commission supports in the development of the Member States is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative technology solutions.
In order to combat VAT fraud, an alternative system of shared payments could be supported under circumstances.
Using block chain technology, new paths are proposed, the KPMG and also Professor E. Ensworth's proposal.
There are very interesting proposals, of course, which we have discussed with the Commission, and the Commission says that they are theoretically and practically capable of finding solutions.
In reality, they have not found any practical application, yet Professor Lamas has made some proposals for the use of technology for imports from non-EU countries.
But this system is accepted by many other countries.
There is no practical experience, but I think we also think it is worth getting deeper into the possibilities of block chain technology.
This is also examined by the Commission for the management of the database of the main single operators.
Numbers to maintain the validity of these numbers of the only establishments.
It is very important that the Member States use the new technologies, because only so can they catch the fleet for the future.
Of course, we are pleased that they have begun to respond to the fraud of the elderly and to rebuild the euro.
Please also monitor the compensation corresponding to the new threshold of ten thousand euros.
This is something the Czech colleagues highlighted in their report.
And we took it up, also for the reason they explained it before.
In order to have a separate MOS and Remote Coordination function in colleagues, we must ensure that the dealer only has the VAT rate, the correct VAT rate in the MOS VAT rebate.
If the trader introduces a false VAT rate, he only receives a notification, but the explanation can still be sent, so he gets a warning, but the explanation will be given anyway.
Please also carry out the necessary checks when entering the registration application into the MOS to avoid the problem of double registration.
Increase the audit activity of most MOS traders and broadcasters using administrative cooperation tools.
An employee of the regular estimates of VAT compliance for e-commerce.
We would therefore be very grateful if you could remind the Member States of this recommendation in your home country.
That is why we ask you to cooperate in this matter and to serve you with everything we know when you have questions.
Mr Mayrbeurle, the floor is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you for the invitation.
It's an honor to be here to talk to you.
My theme is to give you a brief overview of our mass data instrument, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
