Excuse me!
Good morning.
Can I see, please?
Good morning, yes, of course, here it is.
Thank you.

I work with the travel agency "Il Gabbiano"; are you interested in any specific holiday offer?
Yes, I would like to travel to a European city, but I don't know which one.
Well, we are working all over Europe and I would recommend a cold place like Vienna, because I like it; otherwise I would suggest Barcelona.
Can you tell me how your agency works?
We work in different groups that have their respective tasks; they are called Marketing, Front Office and they all work together to develop holiday offers.
That's great, that's really interesting.
Do you also have a visitor card so I can call you later for more information?
Yeah, I think...
Yes, here she is.
That's great.
Thank you so much.
Back.
Bye!
Bye!
