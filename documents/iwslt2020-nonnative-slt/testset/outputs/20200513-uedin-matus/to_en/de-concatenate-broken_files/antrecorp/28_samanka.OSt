Hello!
I am from the staff department of the company Å amanka, s. r. o., which was founded in Liberec in 2018.
We're bringing in alcohol-free fruit lemonade.
We support both local and foreign fruit suppliers.
Currently we sell six flavours worldwide and one of the varieties is a limited edition.
It's the Cotton Candy variety.
If you'd like to try them out, there's... there's some cost-effective charges on our stand.
Our position has number 7, and I think it's not open now, but maybe tomorrow.
We should be there.
I would like to thank you for letting me tell you something about my companies, and I would like to wish you much happiness and fun at this fair.
