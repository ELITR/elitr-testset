Hi!
Hi!
Do you work in a travel agency?
I've seen your name shield.
Yeah, I work at a travel agency in Venice called Magic Travel.
I was just planning a trip with my girlfriend.
We offer romantic requirements, but if you are a more entertaining couple, we also offer sports and culinary trips.
We'd rather be a romantic couple.
We offer trips to Russia, Spain and England.
If you want to look in our catalog...
Yeah, yeah.
Wow, that's very interesting.
Which would you recommend?
I would recommend Verona because it's the city of love, and I think your girlfriend would feel very well there.
For more information, I'll give you my visitor card where you can contact us at any time.
But I have to tell you something: I don't have a girlfriend at all and I'd like to take you to my romantic practice.
I think we'll meet again at the agency.
