Good afternoon.
My name is <NAME> and today I present to you the Time Travel Agency.
The company has taken over our class since 2014. 2018 and has missed a new image, which is why the company's focus today is more on historical packages.
The team has three leading members and 22 eleven members.
As I said, we combine the magic of the past with modern trends to meet customer requirements.
Each package we offer to our customers has three basic services: transport, accommodation and catering, and a number of additional services.
For example, a folklore art workshop, wine tastes, camps for children, riding and boxing tours, paintball evenings, talks and conferences.
As a tribute to the past, Time Travel Agency spends 5% of its revenue on the locks we work with.
They reach us in many ways, Facebook, email, Instagram and Post.
We have a website on timetravelsrl.wixsite.com.
Please visit Stand 66.
Take time with the Time Travel Agency.
Thank you for your attention.
