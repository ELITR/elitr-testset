Oh, that was a tough day!
You're right, very hard!
Do you think it's worth being here at the fair?
Yes, of course!
You know, I'm very confident: selling fashionable and sophisticated products like bed linen and furniture...
People will be brought to buy with us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are produced in Italy: everyone who gives something of high quality knows that.
Yeah, you're absolutely right, but don't forget, we're here to... contact new customers.
Will we be able to reach these new markets?
Well, you know, our seat is in Venice, and that's an advantage: we're so close to these markets, Eastern Europe is just around the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, Czech Republic and Russia will cost a lot of money!
They are expected to make a loss of 5% in the first year.
Come on, think positive! These 5% will match our growth in the third year!
And I'm sure we'll win new customers today.
Yes, you're right.
It's just that all people have to sleep well.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, comfortable mattresses and warm bedding to sleep?
And everything is manufactured by our skilled craftsmen and artists!
It's such a dream!
Yes, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!
