Hi!
I'd like to introduce you to the company I represent.
Develop Bridge.
Our company was founded this year, but we have already won awards... awards... awards.
So we have a pretty bright future ahead of us.
We offer cloud services and minerals.
Cloud services mainly involve Office 365.
So the actual provider is Microsoft, we only sell the licenses.
In particular, we offer three basic licences for a household, individuals and businesses and a large package called E three.
Each option is different in its kind, but it contains all basic applications such as Word, Excel or Powerpoint.
And Minecraft was mentioned.
An open-world construction game suitable for every age.
Perhaps because of his popularity I do not have to imagine it at all; there are now millions of players worldwide.
It is also important to mention that we offer customer-specific applications.
Depending on customer demand, we are able to develop applications that are suitable for it.
If you want to find out more, I can give you a visitor card.
We are pleased to answer your questions at any time.
