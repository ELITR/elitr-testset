Hello!
Which floor are you going to?
Hey, 15.
And you?
22.
Do you mind if I pull out my shoes?
These High Heels are killing me.
Of course I do.
I don't care about that.
Thank you.
Why wear these high heels if you could wear sneakers?
I know a really good store that sells recreational shoes.
Oh, really?
Yeah, I even work there.
His name is CaspoWalk LTD. and we offer many different shoes of different brands like Nike, Adidas for every age and gender.
Do you offer unique shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you what.
We have this month as a special offer a kind of Dutch clogs and if you like sports, you would like the nail-free Nike shoes called Nike Adapt BB.
These are smart shoes that you can control with your phone.
You can customize the cutting angle individually, as you see there, and choose a color for the light diodes with a mobile app.
If I were to buy shoes with you, would you offer me any accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer snowflakes and deposits and much more.
Here's my card.
Come over to our branch.
Oh, thank you.
You'll find us in this building, too.
We're taking part in a fair for school companies.
Thank you so much!
We came to my floor, so...
It's nice to meet you.
See you later.
I was happy too.
See you later.
