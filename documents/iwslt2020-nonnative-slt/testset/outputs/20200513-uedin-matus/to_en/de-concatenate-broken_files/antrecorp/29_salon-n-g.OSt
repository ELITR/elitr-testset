Hello, do we know each other?
Hello, I think we've met before, maybe we visited the same college a few years ago.
I am, and you?
I'm what are you doing?
Well, I'm the manager of a small company Salon NG, an animal hairdresser.
Oh, that sounds very interesting, could you please tell me more about it?
Yes, of course.
We specialize in the care of dogs, cats, horses and nagetiers.
We offer services such as cutting the claws, cleaning the ears or simply cutting the field.
But we also offer things like dog beds and streaming, so... animal clothing or just dog food, especially from the Czech Republic, and anti-allergy of a brand in Ontario.
Do you have pets?
We can offer you the highest quality of care if you want.
Yeah, I got a dog, I'd like to cut his claws, they're too long for me.
Could you please give me your card?
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot them upstairs, but I'm gonna get them right away, if you want, you can come with me.
Okay, let's go.
