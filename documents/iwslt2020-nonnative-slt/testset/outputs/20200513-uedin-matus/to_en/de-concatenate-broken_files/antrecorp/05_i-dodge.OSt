Beautiful weather outside...
Yeah, it's pretty hot today.
Yeah, I think it's a good day to eat, don't you think?
Yes, but I didn't know who; do you know anyone?
I know an amazing Venetian entrepreneur.
Who's that?
He's right in front of you.
Seriously?
Yeah, I'll pick you up at 8:00.
I didn't say yes.
Not yet, where am I supposed to take you with my Lamborghini?
What do you mean?
That is exactly what I said; my Lambo was delivered yesterday by my company from Italy.
So you're in the transport business?
Yes, I have a company in Venice, it's called Idoge; we deliver and send worldwide.
What's the company's name again?
Idoge; we also sell devices that can make pasta, for example Italian pasta.
Oh, that's interesting.
And that's not all: we started 2016, it's not that long ago, but our customers trust us; we're very familiar with our professionalism, they give us really excellent feedback and excellent reviews.
And that's why I'm taking you to Mario's restaurant today, so you can try pasta that was made with our equipment.
Man, you're too self-confident.
It's because I'm proud of what I'm doing.
So, are you waiting for me at home?
Oh, I'm so glad, but I'm already surprised.
Oh, I'm used to...
Bye, all right.
I'm sorry...
