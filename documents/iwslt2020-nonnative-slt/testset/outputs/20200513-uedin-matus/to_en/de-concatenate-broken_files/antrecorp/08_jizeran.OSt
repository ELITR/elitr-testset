So, hello, I'd like to introduce you to my company, Jizeran.
We're from Liberec and we need beer.
It started with a small group of friends who just wanted to use beer and after a while we found out everyone liked it.
We gave it to our friends and they liked it and so we started exporting abroad and in great style needed it.
We offer four types of beer.
Reichenbier Nummer Zehn, Reichenbier Elf, Reichenbier Dreizehn and our dark Special Fifteen.
Our beer is available in doses, bottles, glasses and PET bottles.
And we... our beer is from hops imported from Å½atec.
I'm glad you've all agreed, and if you want to try our beer, you can visit us at Stand 45.
Thank you.
