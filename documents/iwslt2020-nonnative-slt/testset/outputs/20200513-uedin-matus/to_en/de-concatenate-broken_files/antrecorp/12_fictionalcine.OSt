Ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> I am the director of the fictional company FictionalCine, which operates a cinema, shows movies and creates educational programs for schools.
Our company was founded in Mělník on 1 September 2018.
Our company had five members, but we are currently running the company with four people.
Every month we create the new programs and offers for our customers.
As an additional activity, we provide our customers with refreshments.
If you are interested in our education programs, you can contact us by e-mail fictionalcine at gmail Point com or visit our status 55.
We look forward to you.
Thank you.
