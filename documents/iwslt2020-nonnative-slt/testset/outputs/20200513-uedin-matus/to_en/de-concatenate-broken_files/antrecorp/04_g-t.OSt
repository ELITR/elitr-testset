So, hello all together, my name is <NAME> and I would like to introduce the G and T LTD company.
I work in the executive.
We are from the Czech Republic and we are studying at the Economic Academy.
The company's headquarters are in Neveklov.
I'm here today to introduce my company.
Our company is a Ltd., but we are not a big company.
Our company has seven employees and three departments.
The first section is the Economic Division, the second is the Finance Division and the third is the Executive.
I'd like to tell you what our company is making.
Our company creates advertising for other companies.
We put stickers for cars, for pens, for pockets, advertising tables and more.
We also present marketing articles.
For example, we make visiting cards and catalogues.
At the end of my speech, I would like to thank you for your attention and invite you to stand 47.
Thank you.
