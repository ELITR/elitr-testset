Hello.
Hey.
Oh, that's a very nice T-shirt.
What is this brand?
Oh, that's not a brand, it's a logo of my message.
Oh, really?
You got a message?
Oh, yeah, I did.
It is located in the heart of České Budějovice on the Vlatava and has three rooms.
The first category is called Goldfish, it is the most luxurious room in our boat.
Then comes the second category, Silverfish, and the third category is called Bronzefish.
Wow, do you have any special rooms?
Oh, yes, we do.
We have a special room for lovers where you can spend the wedding day and stuff like that.
Wow, you also have a restaurant...
Oh, yes, we do.
We have a restaurant for our guests, which is also publicly available; but our guests eat there for free.
And if you spend more time in our restaurant than you wanted - you know that can happen - you can use our fitness centre with the latest equipment.
Wow, I'm sorry, I don't like fitness, you have massages and...?
Well, if you're not so sharp at fitness, you can visit our relaxation centre with massages, sauna, hot rocks and so on.
Wow, okay, I like that, great.
And I would like to add that we have free Wi-Fi and free parking for our guests throughout the Bottle.
Oh wow, thanks.
I hope you'll come.
I will.
