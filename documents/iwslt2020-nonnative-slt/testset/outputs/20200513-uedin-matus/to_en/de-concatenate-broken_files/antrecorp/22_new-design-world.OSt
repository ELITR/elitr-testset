I'm tired.
This railroad is so striking.
I have to sit down somewhere.
Did I hear that right?
Are you looking for a comfortable chair on which you can sit and rest?
They're in the right place at the right time, and I'm probably the right man.
Another nervous seller who wants to apply for his product.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
My name is <NAME> and I'm the boss of New Design World.
Our company was founded in 1981 in northeast Italy by a group of young people who linked their passion for furniture.
We would like to make our high quality and refined products available to a large range of users.
Our comfortable chairs, for example, are the right compromise of beauty and elegance.
Oh, interesting.
That sounds like a good proposal.
I just really wanted to modernize my office, so go on.
We want to offer something that focuses on the customer without ever giving up quality; and that is why we want to offer our refined products on the basis of user statements.
And that's why...
Are you interested?
Yes, you convinced me!
Fantastic!
And now that you have planned the foundations of your office, look at our modern books and tables.
They are carefully selected, environmentally friendly and fully made in Italy, like all our products.
