Hello.
My name is <NAME> and I'm from the Folkstyle practice firm from <CITY>.
I'd like to tell you a little bit about our company.
Our company Folkstyle comes from Slovakia and produces heavy-duty clothing and fashion accessories that are decorated with traditional Slovak folklore emotions.
As you know, folklore has a very long tradition in Slovakia, and that is why there is still plenty of choice.
It is important to point out that all our products are covered by hand.
In our wide range you will find handmade dresses, skirts, necklaces and also boots or the currently very popular flights - I am wearing one of them anyway.
For our production, we retreat to folkloremotives from various parts of Slovakia.
We are trying to combine these motives with the current fashion trends, so that at the end of the day, there will be timeless clothing pieces that should not be missing in any wardrobe.
Our products are also available for all ages, younger and older people will feel with us.
If you order our products, wait no longer than 30 days for your product.
The payment may be made by transferring or transferring.
