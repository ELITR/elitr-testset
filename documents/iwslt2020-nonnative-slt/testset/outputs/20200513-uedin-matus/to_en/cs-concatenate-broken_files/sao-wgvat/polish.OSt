Well, if you will.
I would like to ask our Polish colleagues to submit their presentation.
Thank you.
And I would like to say a few words about the new regulations and the new instruments that were introduced last year and during this year to restore memory.
We met some of them at our last plenary session in Warsaw.
So those of you who were in Warsaw should know something about that.
So I would like to briefly remind you of some of them and then tell you about our previous audit in this area and our conclusions.
I would first like to mention the single audit file.
We started implementing these instruments three years ago.
Last year, however, the last phase took place because the first phase was that the single audit file had to be submitted to the financial authorities on request.
And now it's an automatic system.
The information shall be submitted electronically without any request.
And since 1 July last year
This is mandatory for all types of economic operators.
Since 2016.
it was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, smaller and now for all companies.
I will also return to this because we consider this to be key in the fight against VAT reduction.
The second legal provision I would like to mention is the so-called ‘fuel package’, and in this case it also applies that the regulation has been introduced gradually.
Dependent on the type of undertaking and its main idea is that fuel trading licences are granted only to companies established in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign companies are registered.
Another requirement is the transport package.
It should be said that the proposal for this law is based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
As we know, the first law of this kind was introduced in Hungary and in Poland we have introduced this system of monitoring the transport of goods only for certain types of certain categories of goods.
In general, these are goods from which excise duty is levied.
I mean fuel, tobacco and some others, and I mean monitoring how this goods are transported by road or by rail.
This means that each individual transport must be replaced before the start of the transport, in a special system, in a reserved system and since last year, in addition, each transport is connected with a geolocation.
So every single truck can determine where it is.
Engineering, parking, etc.
And the Minister of Finance for the Ministry of Finance, which analyzes the entire system of large data that has been delivered online, some of the public institutions, and as we know, there can be a lot of results and there can be some inconsistencies in many.
And this year we plan to carry out an audit of the Ministry of Finance.
As the Ministry of Finance is prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is introduced in the sense that all these companies must register all transport and the system is ready for analysis.
So far, however, we do not know whether the Minister of Finance is using this information for any action taken by the financial authorities.
The other legislation is, to a certain extent, similar to what our colleague, who specializes in technical issues, presented yesterday.
So we have a certain black paper, but in Poland, under the term black paper, we have a list of entities that have been removed from the VAT register.
And we have a system based on information, re-given by online banks and other entities of the financial system.
This system may be used by the Minister of Finance to identify any inconsistencies and problems, and this system is aimed at encouraging unusual transactions and providing information about them to financial authorities online.
On the basis of this information, the financial authority may block the account, the bank account and the specific transaction.
What is the risk of getting a higher fine than, let's say, 10,000 euros.
Another legal provision is the distribution of payments introduced last year.
It's not necessary right now.
But it really matters to the buyer.
If one Contracting Party uses this, then, of course, the payment method for suppliers is mandatory.
It is important that, if this mechanism of payment distribution is used, the common and unbundled liability of the taxpayer is excluded.
I'll show you some numbers, and in a little while, I'll tell you how this distribution can be used in the payment mechanism.
Finally, there is one legislative and organisational instrument that our colleague from the Ministry of Finance had relatively detailed reviews last year.
So we have a new national income management based on the previous free administration, and now we have another administration that is fighting tax and customs administration in one system.
And yet online registration system
Ha ha ha.
At the moment, we have a mandatory type of record-keeping system and the mandatory element of these records is electronic memory.
The financial office is therefore able, on the basis of memory, to verify the authorised types of registration warehouses, but we are only starting with the online registration system for some sectors.
They are primarily legal services, medical services, only certain sectors.
As a result, we must start working on the creation of a central system, which will be headed by the national revenue administration.
In this system, all these transactions should be registered immediately and easily online.
That is why we are going to use this debate to introduce a possible distribution of payments for all taxpayers affected.
This actually means that we would like the financial authorities to wish to replace the transfer of tax obligations by this mechanism of payment distribution and transfer of tax liabilities and liability to society and not share them.
This fall in all sectors where the transferred tax obligation or joint and non-discriminatory liability is binding could apply to all these sectors to this mechanism of payment distribution.
Now that I've submitted, I'll tell you something about our audit.
We ran the audit last year.
The period for which the audit was carried out was relatively long - it was twelve years, and that is why we were also asked by the Polish House of Parliament to carry out such an audit.
We have reached the following conclusions.
We must have noted that the effectiveness of the Ministry of Finance's work has been significantly deteriorating during this long period.
In 2010-2015, we believe that the Ministry of Finance and Finance have developed a somewhat insufficient effort to improve their efficiency in VAT revenue.
As the subject of the audit was the supervision of the Ministry of Finance on Tax Revenue and the choice of taxes, in particular the choice of VAT, it was just here.
One of the signs of this mentioned collapsibility is the effectiveness of the work is
VAT GAP.
And during these years, VAT GAP in Poland was on average 24%, which was about ten points more than the EU media.
Among other things, we have decided that supervision has not been effectively contacted.
So that's how it is.
It can be noted that we have information about VAT GAP in Poland and EU countries and that we have figures from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And as you can see, the average VAT gap in Europe is definitely lower than in Poland; even if we do not take into account the source of information, the figures speak quite clearly.
Mmmm.
I have already said that our main instrument and the main instrument of the financial institutions, as well as the idea put into practice in this period, has been the single audit file, and in the last two years.
For example, in 2017, four million invoices were automatically analysed, but only 3,300 warnings were issued on the basis of these analyses.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed was not too high - it was about five million, but the analysis brought more than 350 000 warnings.
This was reflected in receipts because the first stage is automatic analysis and then comes warning sent via text or email.
So without any official procedure in tax administration, etc.
And this system, and its first phase, the automatic phase, has brought us additional revenue, VAT revenue of more than EUR 150 million per year.
I am talking about numbers for 2017 and 2018.
It should be pointed out that there has been an increase in revenue under the conditions of a good economic situation and an improvement in the choice of VAT, as a result of a large package of legislative and organisational changes.
Nevertheless, we believe that one of the main sources of these results, these financial results, is the introduction of this single audit file.
As a result of another instrument, a mechanism for the distribution of payments in 2018 followed the use of a mechanism for the distribution of payments, which, as I have already mentioned, was unnecessary.
However, we note the increased interest in the implementation of payments in this way.
In July last year, taxpayers made 600 000 transactions.
In December, more than one and a half million transactions were distributed through the mechanism.
The value of the tax paid through this mechanism of distributed payments in July amounted to half a billion euros.
And half a billion euros by December 1st.
Overall, during the period July to December last year, taxpayers carried out more than seven million transactions through a mechanism for the distribution of payments and the amount of tax on special accounts for VAT.
And yet another information about the work of the financial authorities, the financial authorities and the ministry carried out 30 percent less checks last year than in 2017, but with fewer controls, the percentage of checks increased.
In our view, this is the result of the new electronic tools that have been introduced, which have helped to better select entities where checks should be carried out.
It is clear that a reduction in the number of controls has been achieved by reducing the number of controls accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is obviously less painful for taxpayers and is more time consuming.
This led to an increase of 100% in the findings last year compared to 2017.
So we generally believe that several legislative instruments have been introduced in the last few years.
In summary, the results are sufficient.
However, we must not forget that this was done under economically favourable conditions.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine exactly what part of these increased revenues was caused by any factor.
If this is the result of new organisational and legislative instruments
and whether the overall economic situation can do so.
That's all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions, please ask.
