I would like to ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to present its presentation.
All right, this is our current state.
We have two national laws to give European regulation two directives.
One is about paper and digital publications.
Now they have the same rate.
And under certain circumstances, it's a zero rate, but under other circumstances it's six percent.
In the case of the rental of real estate we have accepted ...the possibility of renting real estate ... .. and the duty of VAT for the short-term rental of real estate.
Then we did two audits.
One relates to what we've heard several times, so I'll be very brief about it.
The second concerns the registration system.
And then we also have two new four trends.
Our MOS audit... so it's not complete yet and it's not even published.
All conclusions and recommendations are therefore only preliminary.
But we're almost sure there's no major changes.
Hmmm.
Our conclusions are essentially consistent with what we have heard here today.
But as far as we are concerned, I will only point out some things that are different, but which, in my opinion, are more specific to Belgium.
At present, we only have a limited number of employees in the administration, because we are more than a receiver, unlike the MSID that takes over money, and depend heavily on other Member States.
But in the future, when the MOS expands most, more workers will be needed.
And you should be trained now and known in advance.
Another general conclusion that we have reached, but which has already reached, is that there have been changes in control strategies.
What has to happen is a new direction of thinking.
But our administration strongly believes in the next MSID, because when we look at conclusions like MSCON...
Just skip from one to the other.
So we see that there is a very bad control strategy.
That is why we strongly believe that every MSID will send or transfer money.
That's for us.
However, we have underlined that it is important to make some progress in the area of control strategy, namely by creating risk profiles.
Our report has not yet been able to create good risk profiles because they do not have enough data, but they think they do in the future.
I have more data in the future and I could create certain risk profiles, so in the future we will be monitoring better control policy in the future.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We are following other taxpayers on the Internet, so there is a system to look for taxpayers on the Internet.
But in the meantime, the results are worse.
There are not many things about taxpayers that can be monitored.
Then we see that...
The MSIDD registration procedure is as good as that, but under circumstances when taxpayers are exposed...
There are no follow-up steps if they grant recognition in the normal system.
There is therefore no connection or any follow-up system, which we believe is important.
Then we have... in the confession process.
There are some automatic controls, which we consider very interesting.
So this is not a real check of completeness and correctness (yes, thank you) of completeness and correctness.
But it still helps when it comes to common mistakes.
The actual checks must therefore be carried out by MSCON, but as a MSID, but Belgium is still helping to complete the recognition, so there are certain errors.
In the system there will be an output, or if you have to make a choice and all options will be limited, just click on the possible choices, so there will be fewer errors.
As a MSCON, we also found that they work in Benelux.
So together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they have created a matrix of certain risks and are developing new control activities.
Based on these risks, there are already two test files that have been launched so far.
We therefore recommend continuing to work in this small group to make progress and disseminate knowledge into European fora.
I think it's about the differences that we've had, unlike what we haven't heard before.
So we're about to do a second audit.
He ran the audit of the registry warehouse system.
It's not about the audit that Luden and I did, but about the other members of the auditory cells.
It was also an audit that was somewhat wider than just a VT, but I only present conclusions and recommendations that are important for VT.
The audit focused on the effectiveness and effectiveness of the control policy.
Installations and applications, so they looked at two problems relating to the registration warehouse system.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations reached are such that the regulation is too complex.
It is therefore recommended to simplify the regulation, as there is too much exception to the national regulation.
It was very difficult to establish a certain group only on the basis of the statement itself.
And so it was very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that had to install the registration warehouse system.
Another major conclusion was control policy.
There are problems with the choice of taxpayers for taxpayers for the registration system.
When there was a limit, there's a limit, and if it's too low, then you fall right below this limit, and there's no more control, so that's the way to avoid legislation.
There has also been a problem with cross-checks of data from the database for the selection of taxpayers for their control.
Another conclusion was that there were bad internal controls for the application of the system.
With regard to the fines granted, they found that the various control units had given various penalties.
There were therefore no provisions for fines, but some were very strict and other control teams were not strict at all, or had penalties much lower than the rates that they also gave for certain errors.
It would be an advantage, but now it is not implemented, so risk analysis was very simple and there is no online access, but once we know that this kind of system exists in other countries when they have online access, when they have online access.
They found that this could be a very good advantage.
Then there was also an exchange of information with the National Social Security Office, which was not very good.
A lot of information has therefore not been obtained from one to the other.
Finally about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with placing transactions
The system as such works very well if it is used when it is used as it should be used, but if certain transactions were not entered into the system, they could not be discovered.
The solution could therefore be to create a media campaign so that customers can apply for tickets.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise, it will not be a ticket or that the legislation would be adapted to only electronic payments being accepted, because it would be easier to track money.
However, as a real impact, there is no reliable impact measurement, so they have no idea.
Our team then carried out several tests and tried to find some impact, but found that there was an effect of expectation, because the introduction of the system was delayed a few years.
However, they all knew this was coming, so customers and companies were already expecting legislation that would change and introduce this system.
The exact differences between VAT revenues prior to 2016, when the system was introduced and then were very difficult to trace.
As tax concessions to VAT have increased a few years before 2016, taking into account the new system that would be subject to change.
Our team wasn't sure about the effect.
It's just this system or that the effect was even greater because it started earlier than they thought.
Look, I can stop you, I just have a problem, or I'd like to understand it right.
What am I supposed to imagine under the notion of a system of registration warehouses?
Does that mean that this treasury system is registered somewhere in the database?
No, it's not, it's online, it's cash treasure, yeah "cash."
Yeah, okay, so it's just for cafes, hotels and restaurants.
It's just for certain sectors.
So far, it is only in the Horeca sector and it is a system that registers each transaction or should register any project that is submitted to the system.
(So) There is no online access.
That is why the selection of the control group is so important, because the control teams must go to different locations.
They can't focus on it online on computers, they have to go to HoReCa and connect their computer to the treasure.
To retrieve the data and carry out the check.
Yeah, but they can't do it far away.
It must always reach the operator itself.
So when recognition is too low and below limit.
The teams won't go there to find out if they know the cafeteria, for example, and they know there's a lot of customers and they're not there, but it's just a coincidence.
But that's something they found out later, so they will.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was afraid I was the only one who doesn't understand.
All right, but what's the difference between this system that you're talking about in the registration box for any seller, I mean in the food?
So what's so special about this particular system is that you're there.
There is a special software that offers any possibility of fraud with the system and it is also a software that ensures that the data are transferable to the control team computer.
While you cannot extract data in the normal registry system in the same way.
So these are the registration treasury systems they have.
Yes, they are also special, but I mean there are five different brands of registry stores from which you can choose and have certification.
That all data that can be extracted in data formats are suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yeah, yeah, so compatibility is certified, which is the main part of the domain of different sections.
Yes, you mentioned this analysis of the risk that there was no risk analysis of the risk services, or that they were not all performed or.
Do I mean online access to this analysis, or?
Online access to your own registry warehouse system.
Okay, so which controls could be much easier, well, and because we can carry out automatic checks or data extraction.
Which could be inserted into the larger system and risk analysis was actually very basic because they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or this system was introduced only in 2016, so they had only two years of data available.
All right, finally.
I have two new fraud trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called the Matrimony and consisted of a large number of foreign companies.
But always the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulhar.
But they registered on names that were very similar to known names.
There was a difference only in one letter so that it was possible to presume that these companies existed, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they only applied for VAT and asked for VAT with false invoices to be returned, but they always did so in writing and in very small amounts.
Which means the report had to put all the information in the system, which took time
And so some of the doors were already made before they could actually find out that there is a possibility of fraud and they could check whether the company actually exists and whether the invoices were given.
However, this kind of fraud has been discovered and has already been disseminated through Eurofisc, so I think that every tax administration is already informed about this kind of fraud.
Another fraud consisted of green energy certificates that were very similar to earlier CO3-2 certificates.
The original plan was more similar in sending invoices.
Or they used the company's invoices, which made a lot of comments to the legal firm that would otherwise send the invoices.
So we had a fraud plan, so I shortened it a lot, and I don't have a picture of it.
But I'll explain it this way.
There was a company A in the Member State X which, according to certificates from B in another Member State A, sold these certificates to C.
Again another Member State Z and sent this company an invoice of the corresponding A with a line...
So that's the name of a company that's different from just one letter from the original.
So Company C wouldn't see that they're actually cheating.
And of course, company A and company A made the same managers that have this company A, and A with the line would be a missing trader.
I hope this kind of fraud is clear.
And that was the end of my presentation.
