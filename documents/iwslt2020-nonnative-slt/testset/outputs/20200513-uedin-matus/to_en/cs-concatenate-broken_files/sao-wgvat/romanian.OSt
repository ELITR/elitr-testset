Do you have any further questions?
If not, I would like to ask our Romanian colleagues for a word.
All right, good day.
You all hear me well?
Yes?
So in Romania, we have already introduced nineteen per cent VAT for two years.
And although plans to reduce to eighteen percent have emerged, they have been postponed so far.
In addition, we have two reduced rates of VAT, nine percent and five percent.
In the past year, there have been several changes as regards products that may have a reduced rate.
The biggest change, therefore, will be the sewerage services where the first January of this year began to reduce the rate from nineteen percent to nine percent.
Other appropriations shall remain unchanged.
On the contrary, there have been many changes in the five-year rate, especially in some products, which were at nine per cent and now have been converted to five per cent.
The biggest change was made on 1 June of this year; this change concerned high-quality food and mountain products and traditional products.
And for products produced on the mountains, it is true that cows or sheep that produce them must live there at least half of their lives.
The manufacturer must obtain the authorisation, certificate from the Minister for Agriculture.
Then it will be able to apply a reduced rate.
Then here we have a mechanism transferred to tax liabilities.
In Romania, both companies must be registered in order to be able to use this system.
There are fourteen products for which this can be reduced, and in December two thousand eighteen had to be extended for some of them until the year twenty-two.
Finally, the value added tax system, which was introduced in the year of two thousand seventeen, although it now seems that the Ministry of Finance has somewhat forgotten it.
In the year two thousand seventeen it began with more than four hundred companies and now in the year two thousand nineteen their number fell to forty-six percent.
Moreover, in the year two thousand eighteen did not start using this system any new companies.
So all the companies that started with this started to return from that system to the normal VAT system.
In addition, the European Commission has ordered Romania to stop using this system.
It therefore seems that the system has not met what was expected of it, so the ministry will probably stop using it completely.
Totally?
I come from the data we have at our disposal because no new companies were registered in the year of two thousand eighteen or two thousand nineteen in the year.
So there are only companies in the system that started in the year two thousand seventeen, and their number is falling slowly.
With regard to all these findings, there are still certain regulatory frameworks for the MOSS system, which is in Romania for some reason labelled as M1SS, because they have translated it.
But that's just how it is.
In addition, we lack IT systems in financial offices that could cooperate and exchange data.
Which will not simplify the situation for companies, and last year we finally introduced the electronic system they have in Belgium.
They have introduced electronic registration treasures and companies are now obliged to start using them, so the financial authorities are checking that all companies are installed.
So far, however, we are not sure whether the system is fully functional because of the limits in the IT system of financial authorities.
And so far, no new trends have been identified.
So that would be all.
Thank you.
