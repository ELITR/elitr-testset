Okay, so we did this audit.
The audit report will be published on 16 July.
Therefore keep this information secret.
They shall be subject to the publication of the information embargo.
We are waiting for the Commission's response in all 23 official EU languages.
Because we only have an answer in English, so it's just a formality, and the audit is now behind us.
The name was "Many calls..." and the special report will be "There are a lot of challenges to deal with when choosing VAT from customs duties."
It's about to be solved.
It should initially have been “to be addressed”, but some have already been addressed to a certain extent through new legislation, a new Commission proposal, which has just referred to …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
However, there are still problems that remain to be resolved and we will see them later.
So I'm going to start with why we chose this audit topic.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
And we'll finish our recommendations.
First of all, okay, we did a survey because we're visiting previous research analyses.
On the basis of the findings of the head of these institutions in the field of electronic commerce, German colleagues, Lithuanian colleagues carried out audits.
Also in the previous decision we made on imports, we are analysing the problem of distance from countries outside the EU and related problems relating to VAT and customs duties, and we have decided that this has happened.
The problem is that fair traders are often excluded from the market by unfair traders and are no longer able to compete.
This is a problem that also arose a representative of the academic community, such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and is particularly intense in the UK.
Also estimates of loss.
There are only estimates of distance from non-EU countries.
However, these estimates are not too encouraging, because even if the Commission estimates only five billion annually, it is between £1.5 billion and £1.5 billion annually in the UK.
That's how they estimated losses.
This represents a 8-10% reduction in VAT in the United Kingdom.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently represents only four percent.
So the triple fight against fraud in the UK represents the amount of losses in electronic commerce with goods purchased from third countries.
This is a mission.
We do not count on EU remote sales here, we do not count most electronic services here.
So the basis is to raise our concerns.
Then what we are focusing on is to visit five Member States - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why have we taken into account the number of registrations to the MOS system both in programmes outside the EU and in the US?
The volume of electronic sales within the EU as well as the estimated amount of VAT saved as a result of the VAT exemption on imports of non-durable goods (LVCR).
Following the study of our resources in the Commission, we also visited the Commission.
These steps should be delayed by technology and the World Customs Organisation and the repealed period should last from 2015 to the end of 2018.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposed proposal and all the proposals that will enter into force in 2021.
What are we focusing on?
Of course, we have begun to analyze the answers to our research, and this research, which has been sent by the main group of two.
We continue with the questionnaire in all the Member States that we have visited in discussions with all possible people.
We have gained access, and what is also very important, we have set access to ABC data in the Synergia database, i.e. incident database, problems that Member States report in the MOS system.
We have received access to all project groups of taxation (fiscal) and electronic groups dealing with electronic commerce, and to all project groups related to the BUT, where there is a lot of information and discussion.
And of course, we got funding from the support of institutions from Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally we did our own samples of different transactions.
Overall, we have put together nearly nine hundred transactions related to electronic commerce.
What we find, of course, were first positive things and then we will continue with the most negative ones.
The regulatory framework is governed by the best international procedures with the OECD and World Customs Organisation extremes.
In most respects, the principle of taxation at the place of destination has been observed in most cases, with the exception of this principle.
There is now a new limit value below EUR 10 000 that you can provide in the home Member State, so that is not in line with the OECD.
In the case of the World Customs Organization dealing with imported packages, the guidelines for immediate release have been respected in most respects and also a new proposal within the framework of the standard.
The Commission is a pioneer in this area and, in most respects, adapts itself to the World Customs Organization and standards.
As regards the new provisions which will enter into force in 2021...
I'm trying to solve some weaknesses, but for us, it's the main problem that's still going to exist, underevaluation.
Losses of VAT and customs duties are experience and will continue.
This cannot be addressed by the proposal for an information network with payment service providers.
As far as trade with countries outside the EU is concerned, it will not be resolved, and we will see why later.
Why, yes, because agreements on administrative cooperation with third countries do not work.
We have a new deal with Norway.
We expect a change of information with Norway to work, but that's not a problem.
It's not Norway, the problem is China, it's the United States of America.
The information chain with China is not working because the Chinese counterpart is not responding and the percentage of responses is falling and falling, so that's the problem.
If we have information about a change of supplier that does not work through electronic interfaces, i.e. works directly on their websites that have not been registered in the MOS or even registered and after cancellation.
As we pay VAT from Europe to China, we expect VAT to return to the EU.
Unless we have administrative cooperation, too.
It will never happen.
This is also a problem between EU countries, which is not expected to work.
Administrative cooperation also, so we will see later that the checks carried out by national tax authorities are weak.
Because there are practically no tools to carry out proper risk analysis of the accident that we have already mentioned.
It will therefore be necessary for the Member State to approve the Commission's proposal to amend the information, while payment service providers subject to control by the Commission are insufficient.
And we will see later, of course, that the Commission has not carried out any monitoring or monitoring on this.
In their own electronic systems of recovery, there are weaknesses.
The traditional problem, of course, is that traders underestimated goods to be below the euro threshold for VAT for twenty-two or ten years.
This will disappear in the future, but will continue to be underestimated to pay lower VAT.
It will not be approved, but they will pay less and as far as customs duties are concerned, the assumption is set at EUR 100 50 and cannot be managed.
Because in all electronic ... we will see the EU electronic invoicing system later, they cannot stop the declaration.
Because the cover box has its own electronic..., which applies to the customer electronically because of the catches.
And they passed the system even though they declared the value that is over a hundred fifty.
The electronic system cannot stop this, they said it was something very serious, because the operators working there are hopeful economic operators.
So, the great couriers have the authority of the association of economic operators and say they're the most reliable, but they're abusing this system.
The imposition of customs duties on VAT is not effective.
Okay, provisions on the information chain on the recovery of claims relating to this tax.
The rules were used, of the five Member States that we visited, only in Austria.
Only in five cases, so it's not often used.
We are analysing the inadequacy of payments between Member States.
We have access to the harmonisation of the Committees and there are still mentioned combinations.
Important means a lot between Member States.
In the Netherlands, of course, the problem is that they cannot harmonise, which explains the amounts of VAT received with VAT.
And the problems are also with the comments that our colleagues from NKU yesterday...
They anticipated a problem with Member States' comments on consumption that are not ...
Here is a summary of our findings regarding MOS samples.
We have come to the conclusion that MOS IT infrastructure meets its objectives and is therefore strong.
This can be done by the user, so IT infrastructure is solid, but there are problems with registration and payments between Member States.
For example, as regards the analysis of the incidence reported in the Synergy, there are only twenty-two cases in the Synergy database between Member States, but in five Member States.
Which we have examined, in which Member State the problem has already arisen and as an influential Member State.
There were only twelve cases, so there were not so many cases, the problem is that the position of the Member States was really passive.
Only when the problems escalated, they started working on it, but the solution of the problems lasts a long time.
As far as MOS is concerned, it takes a long time, but there are not many problems.
Also, in view of the technical errors reported and received between Member States, the response is also very passive, it is not proactive only when the problem escalates as an incident to which they start responding.
But this infrastructure for MOS is robust.
We've assessed whether they're ready for a single contact point.
We have received several complaints, especially from Austria.
They say that they will not be prepared, nor from the Dutch road that we have not analysed, because the system is developing in particular to ban using a single point of contact for imports.
Registration problems are here.
We need to distinguish between the system outside the US and the EU system, only eighty per cent of registration applications have not been properly controlled.
As far as the known system is concerned outside the United States and we have even found it, we have found cases of two registrations, which is something serious, since as far as payments are concerned, the problem is particularly the problem of the missing ones.
And sometimes according to the Member State of identification.
And problems with registration and cancellation of registration.
This is the most relevant cooperation of the administrative authorities, it is the exchange of information between the Member States that we have visited.
And here we compare with the overall activity of information chains, which we see, for example, that there are general information requirements that have been sent to one hundred and eighty-two compared to the total information requirements.
Generally speaking, it does not have to do with the usual nine thousand two hundred, so neither in the UK will many of them be more problematic, for example three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is good, it is very low, and also some Member States have not changed, which is not why we recommend separating the centralised national office of the CNO.
A separate structure intended for electronic commerce or at least for MOS, so the level of information transmission is very weak.
Then we have multilateral controls, in two cases there were six cases of multilateral controls.
It was a really successful experience.
In two cases, however, this was not at all successful, as the Member State of identification refused to participate in multilateral checks.
This is something that should be resolved by advocating new legislation, because now two Member States can ask for control.
Another is the recent request that the other Member State should not refuse such participation.
So let us hope that this will improve, but there are other important things for Eurofisc.
There were four hundred eighty signals, a chain through Eurofisc works for electronic commerce full of five, and only one feedback link for these four hundred and eighty.
Therefore, the Member State did not consider this information to be very useful, it does not know why only five Member States were selected, the seniors entered the database.
And the others didn't read it because they didn't think the information was too useful.
There are therefore also a number of signals concerning trends or the subject of fraud, three or four topics that they consider useful.
And then there are changing tools for web crawling, but that is something that some members legally take over in their country.
In other Member States, national legislation prevents them from using web crawling tools.
The work file is now frozen and frozen activities are not useful.
They are waiting for a proposal for an information chain between payment service providers.
Because they will, they will have the database and access.
This is the Commission's proposal on all information provided to payment service providers as well as other countries on the Commission's proposal.
Of course, we support and submit a proposal very much to the report, but I did not know until yesterday that I asked myself that the Commission also needs some support for this proposal, because Lubik Lubis needs some support for it, because it does.
However, I accepted this in the Council, of course, because this proposal comes from some discussion in some forums with the Member States and with the parties involved.
Let's hope... this is very important, because the next problem is the lack of controls, audits for MOS.
Why is there so little audit?
You can compare here that no one is, because it's never how I can, if not, I don't know I don't have a data area analysis.
So my audit is going to be random with maybe a lot of information and no records, so they're going to need some data, and this is the data.
In addition, the company will have a lot more applications.
Yeah, they seem to understand Germany because we have data.
It's a team outside the United States, but information that can be available.
Phenomena.
But I don't know anymore, there's practically no control anymore.
Furthermore, remote sensing within the EU has not been too successful.
The customs office therefore has the results of a sample of courier from and abuse of postal services.
In the mail, the main problem in solving the question of undervaluation is that you have drones very expensive drones declared under ten units or up to twenty two euros.
Samples like this are thousands of times as simple.
And they can read and it's very difficult to handle it at the post office level.
And for couriers, they're abusing the usual catch of a hundred fifty, because I'm just going to take a cover box and then 50 can't close.
Declaration of termination of the declaration, even if devaluation is higher than one hundred fifty, we check that not only in the sample, but also directly in the procurement electronic system in the midst of the review, we have carried out a number of inspections.
The Member States did not work in any Member State, only in Austria.
But he didn't wake up in Austria.
We made another declaration on alcohol.
And then for alcohol it was banned and because this categorisation is applicable to alcoholic products.
There are therefore some errors in the Austrian system.
This and the problem are therefore approved by the economic operator who abuses this system of the most reliable traders on the contract.
Furthermore, we have a recommendation recommended for the Commission to use the structures provided in the mutual assistance agreements with countries outside the EU.
If you want to solve these problems, solve problems find a lack of answers.
Also carry out on-the-spot inspections of Member States' inspections on catches.
Minimally monitor the operation of distance selling within the EU, mixed goods are the only thing the Commission has not accepted.
That's why they laughed yesterday because your job is
Monitoring the commission and <CENSORED 22:25> said, "Yes, yes, yes."
I was laughing, but fine.
They help the Member State develop a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for new arrivals.
Because this is a problem, we cannot know whether or not the system works.
It is assumed that most systems will succeed, but it is usually a presumption, and that is why we estimate most of the VAT gap.
We do not know whether the system is successful, and we do not have any estimate for the European Union itself, so that would be very important.
Since the Commission helps Member States to develop, it is a matter of calculating the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative solutions.
In order to address VAT fraud, there may be aid in the form of an alternative payment distribution system.
With the use of blockchain technology, roads, KPMG KPMG and Professor E. Ensworth's proposal are proposed.
There are very interesting proposals, of course, which we have discussed with the Commission, and the Commission says that they are theoretically, in practice, coming to a solution.
In fact, there was no practical application, Professor Lamas also presented several proposals for the use of technology for imports from countries outside the EU.
However, this system is accepted by many other countries.
There's no practical experience, but I think it's also worth going deeper into blockchain technology that offers opportunities.
This is something that the Committee on the Management of the Database of Important Mixed Goods Trade is also investigating.
Number for reporting the validity of these numbers.
It is very important who the future is, the only way to deal with using the name of new technology for the Member States.
Of course, we like them to start responding to fraud and modifying Eurofisc.
Also follow the compromise in line with the new limit of EUR 10 000.
That is something the Czech colleagues have pointed out in their report.
And we took it into consideration also for the reason they explained it earlier.
In order for us to have a separate MOS and a remote coordination function for colleagues, we must ensure that the trader can introduce the VAT rate, the correct VAT rate in VAT returns to the MOS.
Because when a trader introduces a bad VAT rate, he only gets advice, but admittance can be sent the same way, so he gets advice, but he will still be sent.
Please also carry out the necessary checks after receiving an application for registration in the MOS to avoid this problem of two registrations.
Increases the audit activity of most SME traders and sellers on a remote basis through administrative cooperation instruments.
Employee of regular VAT estimates in electronic commerce.
Therefore, if we were to be very grateful for this recommendation to the Member States, we would be very grateful if you would remember in your home country the importance of following our recommendations.
That is why we are seeking your cooperation in this matter, and that is all we know if you have any questions.
