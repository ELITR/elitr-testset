welcome to talk about the Internet
Which is what you are using
Internet is a big network of connected computers
and by 2014 more than
billion websites
Total billion
It was just a million years ago.
And it's been a lot since.
on what pages we use
initially used
scientists to share their research
for example, the accelerator of the particles
It's just that everyone's using it today, and it's almost anything.
can be written with family via social network
share with other photos
their cute cats
travel portals can plan trips abroad
and to the rapporteurs,
Find out what's going on again.
and then of course it is necessary to use the pages
khan academy for study
So what's your favorite page?
I have a little better question for you, actually.
how you should look like the website you're missing on the Internet..2<en> e.com/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc/doc
maybe a page about you
or something you like
great is that you can program such a page yourself
And you can learn that here at khan academy.
think first about what you want to create
Because you'll learn how to do it soon.
But for the beginning, let's explain the terminology.
What exactly is the internet?
How I said it's a lot
connected computers with websites
when the computer is connected to the internet and provides the website
We call it a server
by English server to serve
the website is written in three languages
html to which page structure is formed
css then edits its view and javascript makes the site interactive
how users see these pages
we use an internet search application for this
for example chrome firefox or internet explorer
we call these applications a browser
viewer tries to view the page as well
but have certain differences
That's why we always say
if an error occurred try using another browser
what browser you are using right now
you need to use this browser on some device
For example, on a notebook with a tablet or smart TV
All of this equipment we call customers
customers can be very different
Some are smaller than others
some have touch screens other keyboards
Some are black
website tries to look good
on all different devices
and what equipment you use
And that's the Internet.
Then his double verse,
There's a lot more we can learn about.
but I think it's time to start writing some html and css
and create your own website
