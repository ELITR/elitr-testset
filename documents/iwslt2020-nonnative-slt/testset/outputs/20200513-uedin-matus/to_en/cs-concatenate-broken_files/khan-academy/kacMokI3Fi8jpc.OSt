exhale 109
only to repeat if we want to write 109
That would be literally 109 percent, which is the same thing.
as 109 for and now I could rewrite the cent
But we already know.
So 100 literally means 100.
means 109 out of 100
If we had 100 out of 100 we would have one whole
But now we have more than the whole
we have 109 out of 100
we can write it as a ratio or a fraction
is equal to 109 divided by 100
equal to 109 over 100
So let's do it.
Here we have the whole thing we'll be
consider this square as a whole
We've been counting on it in the last video.
It's 4 to 10.
is divided into 100 parts
we want to get 109 of these 100 parts
How it's gonna look
means we're shooting everyone.
100 parts here
I'll make it a new color.
So we're going to pick this whole thing out.
If we chose, we should have 100.
would be 100 divided by 100 or 100 out of 100 or 100
I think you're starting to understand.
I don't want you to just learn to remember
literally that means 100 out of 100 or the whole
So that's the whole square.
It's 100 out of 100 here.
Question 109
We've already done 100 out of 100 but we still have to do another 9.
So let's pick another 9.
So now we have 1 2 3 4 5.
6 7 8 9
This piece right here.
That's exactly it.
It's 9 over the square.
This is 100 squared.
If we take this whole piece and add this blue part to it
we get 109 one
whole quarter
I hope that makes sense.
