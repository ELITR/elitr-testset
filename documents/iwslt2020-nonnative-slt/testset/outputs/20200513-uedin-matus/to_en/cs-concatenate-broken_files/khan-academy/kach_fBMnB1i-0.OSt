fill in the table with integers as follows:
to record 430 in five different ways
Think about it a little bit.
this 4 over here we can see as 4 hundred
So four hundred.
And there's 3 over here in place of ten, so 3 tens.
We have four hundred and three tenths.
But it's going to be written differently.
For example, we can only have 3 hundred
We took 100 of the hundreds and now
We can put it in place for tens.
When you take the 100 and put it in place for tens
100 is 10 decimals
Now you've got 10 tens, but you've had 3 tens before.
So you're going to have 13 tens here.
Maybe it seems a little confusing.
Don't forget it's 430.
This is 300 plus 130.
That's still 430.
like you can see as well as 200 plus 230
230 is the same as 23 tens.
the same way you can view it as 100 plus 330
33 tens is 330
It can also be seen as 0 hundreds and 43 tens
43 tens is 430
