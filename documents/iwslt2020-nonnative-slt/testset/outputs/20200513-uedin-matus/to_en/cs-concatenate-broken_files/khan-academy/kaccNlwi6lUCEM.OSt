we have a role a girl is about to make 3 police for
of his father
has a piece of a ring that is 12 meters long
wants the top police to be less than a meter short of
medium font
I'll do it in different colors.
So he wants the top police to be half a meter shorter than
medium font
read the entire edition first
and the underside shall be less than a half meter long
upper font
choose another color
I'll make it blue.
The lower shelf will be less than a half meter short of twice
length of upper font
how long will the individual boxes be if
consumes a whole 12-metre ring
Let's denote the variable lengths of the font
Because that's what we have to calculate.
We have the upper police and the middle police.
and underwear
So let's say t denotes the length of the upper font.
t denotes the length of the top shell
and the length of the middle line shall be equal to m
m means the middle pole
and b will denote the length of the bottom line
b is therefore the lower field
Now let's find out what these different statements tell us.
So the first statement says that the girl wants to have a top cop.
use the same color wants to have the upper
Police stations less than half a meter from the middle police
So he wants the length of the top font to be
less than half a metre in diameter
We have all the variables in meters so we can write
length of medium font min
12 meters
That's exactly what the orange word tells us.
the upper shelf must be 12 metres shorter than the length
medium font
So what's next?
and the underside shall be:
12 metres less than
double the length of the upper shelf
So it's 12 meters less than twice.
length of upper font
These are both written statements.
using equations
the length of the upper font is equal to the length of the middle font
minus 12
is 12 meters shorter than the average font
and the bottom shelf must be 12 meters shorter than
double the length of the upper shelf
And how do we solve it?
Well, just solve it with these two equations.
we can't, but there's more information in the back.
we have been given here how long each font will be if
devon uses a total of 12 meters of bread
so the length of all the poles must
be together 12 meters
consumption of all
So t plus m plus b must be 12 meters.
These are the length of each of the poles.
and she uses a total of 12 meters of breast
So the total length of the brick must be 12 meters.
So what can we do with it?
but we can all express depending on one variable
So let's say that depends on m, and then let's subtract it.
dependency t on m already expressed
we can substitute all t in the equations
relation m minus 12
but there is b dependent on t
how to express it
Well we know t is equal to m minus 12.
replace all variables t
This expression
that's t equal to
we can rewrite the blue equation as the length of the bottom
the shell is 2 times longer than the length of the top shell
And we know t is equal to m minus 12.
And if we simplify it a little bit, we get
The bottom box is equal to the square root of the two.
2 times m is 2m
2 times minus half is minus 1.
And that's minus 12.
Or we could write it as b is equal to 2 times the length.
medium font minus 32
That's right.
1 is 22 and minus 12 is
minus 32
So now we've all expressed it by m, and we can
all get back
So the top font instead of the t right over here.
without m minus 12
So here we're going to give m minus 12 plus the mean length.
font plus length of bottom font
So we've already expressed it by m.
That's what we just did.
here is the length of the bottom line according to m
So instead of writing b here, let's write 2m minus 32.
plus 2m minus 32 is equal to 12.
All we did was we replaced t
We expressed t by m and expressed b by m
Now let's add all the members with m and the constants.
here we have one m here another and
then we still have 2m here.
And they are all positive.
So 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4.
So we have 4m.
and permanent members
here we have minus 12 and then minus 32.
So minus 12 minus 32 is minus 42, which is
minus 2
So we have 4m minus 2.
And of course it's still true that this is equal to 12.
on one side of the equation we just want to have
unknown
So let's add to both sides plus 2, and let's get rid of the two over here.
on the left
So if we add 2 to both sides of this equation
so on the left hand side will only wake up 4m and these members
cancel out and that's equal to 14.
Now we divide both sides by 4 and we get m is equal to m.
14 divided by 4 is 72 meters because we're counting
in metres
Now we know him, but we still miss him.
what t a b is
Let's do this.
Let's do t.
t is equal to m minus 12
So this is equal to our m is 72 minus 12 and this is equal to
equal to 62 was not 3 meters
we count in meters because we know that
It's in meters.
So the top shelf is 3 meters long.
The middle field is 72 meters, which is the same as 3.
12 metres
And the bottom shelf is 2 times the top shelf.
minus 12
And that's how much
That's 2 times 3 meters. That's the length.
upper font minus 12, which is 6
minus 12 was not 5 and 12 meters
And we're done.
and you can check that the sum is actually 12
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 meters and that's
means that equality is met
the upper font is 12 meters shorter than the middle font
The lower shelf is 12 meters shorter than
double the top shelf
And we're done.
already known length of the shell which
devon needs to make
