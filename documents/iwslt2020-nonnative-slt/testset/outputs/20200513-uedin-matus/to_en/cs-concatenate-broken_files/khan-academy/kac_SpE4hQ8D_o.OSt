Let's take a few examples.
Let's take a look at this.
first example
15 out of 40
examples with percentages are dealt with by transferring
percentage of the decimal number that we then multiply
the number from which we want to count the percentage
So 15 times the decimal number is zero. So 15 times the decimal number is zero.
I hope we've already learned that in a video about moving percent to a decimal.
in vision,
And we're going to multiply it by 40.
So 40 times zero is 15 cents.
5 times 0 is 0.
5 times 4 is 20.
Moved Down
write zero
And then 0 times 0 is 0.
1 times 4 is 4.
And we get six zero zero.
write a decimal line
one two
top ten line is not so one two and a line
belong here
So 15 out of 40 is equal to zero over 15 cents times 40, which is equal to 6 over 0 cents.
That's the same thing as 6.
other example
I hope it didn't help you very much.
Now I'll try to confuse you a little bit.
if, however, you are not confused by the previous example
how much is zero the whole of two tenths percent of now figure out the number of seven
Many people are inclined to say that
oh zero the whole of two tens percent is the same as zero the whole of two tens.
If you see it the same way, it's a mistake.
Because we know it's not a zero for two decades.
It's zero, two tenths of a percent.
Think about it in two ways.
I can say that it's zero over two fractures of the stem, which is
if you multiply the reader and the denominator of the ten
Same as two fractures of a thousand.
or use technique when moving
the tenth line of two places to the left
What if we start with zero over two tens and move
the tenth line of two places to the left we get the hopla
oh
hop hop
The decimal line will come here
So that's zero over 2,000.
It's the key.
zero of the whole of two tens of percent is equal to zero of the whole of two thousand.
It can lead you to this mistake I'm making out of ignorance.
But don't be sad if you ever do.
Always shake when you see each other
decimal number and percentage
Now that we've come to write a percentage
as a decimal, we have to multiply the number.
of which we count the percentage
So zero over 2,000 times 7.
It's quite simple.
7 times 2 is 14.
How many numbers do we have?
for the tenth line
count
one two three
So we have to have three numbers per decimal.
So zero over two tenths of a percent of 7 is equal to zero over 14 thousand.
I guess you're saying it's
really small number
And that's right, because zero is a whole two-tenth percent if we think about it.
is less than 1
less than one hundred
And actually, if we're proud of this, the whole two-tenth percent is one-fifth.
And if we count this then one of the five of the seven
That's the number.
It's important to check it out.
It's always good to take a test because
when you work with decimals and percentages
It's very easy to lose in dozens of places.
or make a multiplication of ten
Always take a test
Now I'll confuse you even more
What if I say of what number is four twenty percent?
Of which number
many may lose
take 20
Which is going to be zero over twenty cents.
And I'll multiply it four times.
And that would be a mistake.
Because let's think about it.
I said how much is 20 out of 4 no
I said 20 of some number is 4.
We're going to do some algebra right now.
I bet you weren't expecting it in percentage cases.
Let's say x is the number you're looking for.
And the back says 20 of x is equal to 4.
I think in this way you already know
how to write 20 decimals
zero of twenty cents or zero of two tens
And we multiply this times x to get 4.
20 is the same as zero over two tens.
It's the same as zero over twenty cents, but it's going to be the last zero.
we don't need
zero over two tens times x is equal to four.
And there's a simple linear equation.
I bet you weren't expecting it.
What about it?
two views are possible
we can just divide both sides of this equation.
coefficient u x
So if we divide zero by two tens over here and zero by two tens over here
it turns out x is equal to 4 divided by 0 over 2 tens.
So let's figure out how many is 4 divided by 0 over 2.
Maybe we'll have plenty of room.
zero over two tens is going to go into four. So let's write this tens line over here.
Let's move the tenth line over here.
one place to the right
We get 2 and we have to move the decimal line here.
one place to the right
applies that 02 goes into 4 so many times
as 2 to 40
And that's easy.
2 to 40
2 is 4 times 2.
And to zero, 2 is going to be zero times 2.
2 is 20 times 40.
2 is 20 times 40.
So 4 divided by 0 is 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 out of 20.
And it makes sense.
There's more ways to think about it.
20 is exactly one fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
agrees
For sure we can do a test
find out what 20 of 20 is.
So 20 out of twenty is like zero over two tenths times 20.
And if we count it, we'll get 4.
So we thought the result was right.
try another similar example
I choose the numbers from the bottom
maybe 3 is 9 out of what
again x is equal to the number of which 3 is 9
You don't have to rewrite it like that.
So they knew that zero over nine times x is zero over nine times x is the same thing.
as 9 of x is equal to 3
or x is equal to 3 divided by 0 over 9.
divide by decimal number
So let's write the decimal line.
and several necessary zeros
Move the ten-line right over here by two.
We have to move it in two places and here.
009 goes into 3 so many times
as 9 to 300
9 goes into 30 three times
3 times 9 is 27.
I think I see the pattern.
Thirty-three three times nine is 27.
30 to be repeated
will still be based on 3
based on 3 is 9 of you can also write
333 periodic reports also know that 03
It's actually a third.
So 3 is 9 out of 33 whole and one third
And that's an acceptable answer.
often when we process percentages
looking for only approximate result
precision is not so important here
In this case, but we will be precise.
as in tests and there
where necessary
Maybe it wasn't too fast, and you have a percentage.
good feeling
in case of interest
watch how they are written
if you find 10 out of 100
It's easy.
We just take 10 to the decimal number and multiply it by the stem.
if 100 is 10 of the quantity
It should be noted that this is another example
of which number is 100 10 and when we count
It's going to be a thousand.
Maybe I talked pretty fast when I was counting the percent.
But I hope it didn't help you.
I'll give you some more examples.
