I'm tired.
This train service is so exhausting.
I have to sit somewhere.
Did I hear you right?
You're looking for a comfortable chair you could sit in and rest?
You're in the right place at the right time, and I'm probably the right person.
Another poisonous salesman who wants to offer his products.
Wait, wait... before you take the wrong picture, let me introduce myself.
My name is <NAME> and I am the Director of New Design World.
Our company was founded in 1981 in northeastern Italy by a group of young people who combine passion for furniture.
Our aim is to produce high quality and sophisticated products available to a wide range of users.
For example, our comfortable chairs are a perfect combination of beauty and elegance.
Yeah, interesting.
That sounds like a good offer.
I just wanted to improve my office, so keep going.
We would like to offer something that focuses on the customer without forgetting the quality. So we would like to offer our sophisticated products.
And, so...
Would you be interested?
Yes, you mentioned me.
Great!
So now that you've planned your office, what about looking at our modern chairs and tables?
They are carefully chosen, environmentally friendly and the entire production is taking place in Italy, as in all our products.
