Hello, nice to meet you.
I'd like to introduce myself and my co-worker.
My name is <NAME> and I am the manager of our travel office.
And this is our IT specialist, Miss <NAME>.
It's nice to meet you.
We're glad we can be at this fair.
We represent a team of nine people from Russia and the name of our travel office is Remoa.
Our travel agency focuses on the road to Japan, especially after its largest island of Hong Kong.
Our goal is to satisfy customers with every wish, even the most demanding, with an individual approach.
You will discover many faces of Japan with us, such as the modern city of Tokyo.
Osaka's living town, full of concrete sharks.
The culturally rich city of Nagoja with a famous 17th-century castle.
Hakone with Japanese bathrooms under Fuji Mountain.
And Nikko with breathtaking nature and beautiful shrines.
Discover the wonderful country with us, Japan.
The land of the rising sun.
So different, so attractive.
Thank you for your attention.
