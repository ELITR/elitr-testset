I work in Hotel Bosco.
Our address is in Barcelona, in the heart of the city.
As you know, Barcelona offers a lot of busy tourist destinations.
We're here to help you find these places and get on them.
That's why we offer you a car rental, but you can also use a city-wide transport, which is located two minutes from our hotel.
We also offer a gym in case you want to go through your body.
We also have a conference room.
If you are an entrepreneur, then you have the opportunity to visit new business relationships here.
We also offer interesting bathrooms and swimming pool.
You'll rest in our hotel.
So this is about our hotel, and you'll find us at the station number one hundred and five, and if you want to come, I'd love to see you.
I hope you liked my presentation and thank you for coming.
