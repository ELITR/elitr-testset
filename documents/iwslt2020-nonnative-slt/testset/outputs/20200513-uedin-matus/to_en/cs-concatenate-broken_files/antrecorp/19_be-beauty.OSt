Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
Our company is called Be Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on 15 May 2017 and was taken over by <NAME>.
We sell clothes and clothes from Czech designers and creative works.
We work on the quality of materials. Our clothes and clothes are made of recycled and natural materials.
We would also like to mention environmental problems in the fashion industry.
The fashion industry contributes most to environmental pollution.
And yet... it produces over a hundred and fifty billion pieces of clothing, and billions of other clothing are burned or buried in the pit.
By 2030, the fashion industry will grow, as the population increases.
The typical clothing production cycle is as follows: obtaining material for the production of substances, production of substances, fabrics, preparations, dyeing and printing, and finally sewing and final cleaning of clothing.
Thank you for your attention, we wish you a nice day.
