Hello!
I'd like to introduce you to the company I represent.
Develop Bridge.
Our company was founded this year, but has already received several awards.
So there's a great future ahead of us.
We offer cloud service and Minecraft.
Cloud service is mainly related to Office 365.
So the real supplier is Microsoft, we're just selling licenses.
In particular, we offer three licences, for households, individuals, companies and one large package called E3.
Each of these variants differs slightly, but all contain basic programs such as Word, Excel or Powerpoint.
And then we have mentioned Minecraft.
A building game with an open world suitable for every age.
Maybe she doesn't even have to be introduced, because of her favorite, she's got millions of players around the world.
It should also be mentioned that we offer apps in peace.
On the basis of customer requirements, we can create an app that will perfectly fit it.
If you want more information, I can give you my card.
I'd love to answer your questions at any time.
