Excuse me!
Good morning.
Can I have a look, please?
Good morning, yeah, sure, here you are.
Thank you.

I'm working for the Il Gabbiano travel agency, would you like to know if there's any particular interest?
Yes, I would like to visit a European city, but I don't know which one.
Our offer covers the whole of Europe, and I would recommend a cool place like Vienna, because I like it. Otherwise I can suggest Barcelona.
Could you tell me how your agency works?
We work in several groups divided by tasks. They are marketing, customer contact department, ... and all work together to develop a travel offer.
That's great, really interesting.
Don't you have a card so I can call you later for more information?
Yes, I mean...
Yes, there he is.
That's great.
Thank you so much.
Please.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
