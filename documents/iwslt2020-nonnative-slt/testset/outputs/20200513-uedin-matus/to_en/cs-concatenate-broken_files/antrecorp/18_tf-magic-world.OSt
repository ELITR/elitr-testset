Hello!
My name is <NAME> and I represent the Magic World team.
Magic World focuses on organizing social events, especially for children and teenagers, such as birthday parties, private and thematic celebrations.
Our goal is to become the most famous company that organizes such events.
Our mission is to do something spectacular from the usual event.
Over the course of time, the company's activities differed by how more and more we take into account the needs and requirements of our customers.
Today we have a wide range of age categories, such as clown parties, fairy parties, comic book parties, magic and karaoke performances and loutkov√© theatre.
We are taking steps with marketing trends, so we organise celebrations at home, in maternal and elementary schools and in other places as desired by the customer.
We offer complete services: facial painting, various types of balloons and thematic decorations for memorable celebrations.
Our employees have experience with children and we have been working in this field for a long time.
We are convinced that our company has a business idea that is profitable, because it is focused on the future, has experienced employees who work with enthusiasm, and mainly its offer is comprehensive and comprehensive.
That's why our motto is, "We're having fun!"
