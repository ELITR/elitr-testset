Hi friends, my name is <NAME> and I'll introduce you to today's corporate presentation in which I represent the most famous fictional firm, just like Austria, Total Regal.
We've been ruling the market since 1999, and we've been fighting the dreams of other companies.
Our CEO actually led this company before some of you were born at all.
Imagine that.
So where is our headquarters?
Of course on the mountains.
No, I'm kidding, we really have other cities than Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirt and short leather pants, no, I'm kidding.
Actually, it can happen, though, that we're going to pull out traditional clothes to one of the countless parties that we're having when we want to get a beer or something.
Well, well, maybe two beers.
So why should you buy our products?
The most popular of our products, of which we have actually become real icons, we have been selling since 1999, i.e. for two decades.
For example, Helping Hand, which is a great way to store all kinds of clothes, such as jacket, or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and cables.
So come and look at our store and as we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
