Nice weather out there...
Yeah, it's pretty hot.
Well, I think today's the day to go out for dinner, what do you think?
Yes, but I don't know who you know about.
I know a wonderful Venetian entrepreneur.
Who's that?
They're standing right in front of you.
You mean that?
Yes, I'll pick you up at 8:00.
I didn't say yes.
Where can I get you to my Lamborghini?
What do you mean, man?
Just like I said, my Lambo sent me my company from Italy yesterday.
So you're in transport?
Yes, I have a company based in Venice, called Idoge, we are engaged in the transportation of goods around the world.
What's your company's name?
Idoge.
Yeah, that's interesting.
And not only that. We started in 2016, quite recently, but our customers trust us, we know our professional approach and we get a really great response and evaluation from them.
That's why I'm going to invite you to Mario's restaurant tonight so you can taste the cookies made by our machine.
Hoch, you obviously believe too much.
Because I'm proud of what I'm doing.
So you'll wait for me at home?
Oh, you've made me very happy, but I've got something else.
Well, yeah, I'm used to...
Bye, bye.
I'm sorry...
