Good afternoon.
My name is <NAME> and I represent the Time Travel Agency.
The company was founded in 2014. In 2018 it took over our class, did rebranding and the result is that today the company is more focused on historical packages.
The team has three leading members and twenty-two eleven students.
As I said, we combine a piece of the past with modern trends to meet customer requirements.
Each package we offer contains three basic services: transport, accommodation and food and various additional services.
For example, works of folk art, wine tasting, children's camps, riding courses and luxury clubs, night paintball, meetings and conferences.
In terms of respect for the past, Time Travel Agency provides five percent of the profits of the gardens with which it cooperates.
You can contact us in many ways, on Facebook, email, Instagram and mail.
Our website is on timetravelsrl.wixsite.com.
Don't hesitate and come and see our tent number sixty-six.
Enjoy a moment with the Time Travel Agency!
Thank you for your attention.
