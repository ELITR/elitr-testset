Oh, that would be a tough day!
You're right, really tough!
Do you think we'll get paid to participate in this fair?
Oh, sure!
You know, I don't feel confident because we sell fashion and trendy products like bedding and furniture...
People don't come to buy anything from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are made in Italy: everyone knows that this is a guarantee of high quality.
You're absolutely right, but remember, we're here to contact new customers.
Can we apply to these new markets?
Well, you know, our headquarters are in Venice, and that's the advantage: we're so close to these markets, Eastern Europe is right behind the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will be expensive!
This will mean a five-year loss in the first year.
Come on, think positive, these five percent will be our profit in the third year!
And I'm sure we got new customers today.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, everyone needs to sleep well.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, a comfortable mattress and a warm bed cover?
And it's all manufactured by our shock absorbers!
It's a dream!
Well, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!
