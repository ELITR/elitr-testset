Hello!
I am from the staff department of Å amanka, s.r.o., which was founded in 2018 in Liberec.
We make non-alcoholic fruit lemonade.
We support local and foreign fruit suppliers.
We are currently selling six flavours worldwide, one of which is a limited edition.
It's the taste of sugar cane.
If you'd like to taste them, you'll find samples in our stand.
We've got stage number seven, and I don't think it's open now, but maybe tomorrow.
We should be there.
I would like to thank you for listening to my company's presentation, and I would like to support you with much happiness and fun at this fair.
