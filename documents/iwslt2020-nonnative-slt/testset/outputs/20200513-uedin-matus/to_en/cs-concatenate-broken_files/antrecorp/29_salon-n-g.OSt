Hello, don't we know each other?
Hello, I feel like we've met before, maybe we went to the same school a few years ago.
Yes, and you?
Yes, what are you living with?
I'm the director of Salon NG's small business, which is the zoo.
Yeah, that sounds really interesting, could you tell me more about him?
Yeah, sure.
We're looking after dogs, cats, horses and rodents.
We offer services such as cutting wire, cleaning ears, or just cutting hearts.
However, we also offer various products such as dog fur and podest√Ωlky, animal clothing and dog food, especially without allergens, from the Czech company Ontario.
Do you have any pets?
We can provide you with the highest quality of care if you are interested.
Yes, I have a dog, I'd like to let him shave his drapes, I'm gonna get too long.
Would you please give me a card?
Oh, sorry, I forgot them upstairs, but I'll be right there for them.
All right, let's go.
