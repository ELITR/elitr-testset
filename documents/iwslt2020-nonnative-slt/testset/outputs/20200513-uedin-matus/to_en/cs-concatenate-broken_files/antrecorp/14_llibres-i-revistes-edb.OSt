Good afternoon!
Good afternoon.
You know EDB?
No, I never heard of her.
Where does he live?
We are a company from Barcelona and we have more than a century of experience and good news.
This is a great idea, because our society would like to expand to Europe as a whole.
That's a great idea.
And what exactly are you selling?
We sell books, magazines, events like October, Tomorrowland, which are so popular.
Our company focuses on the same kind of services and products, so it could be good to become business partners.
And what is your company focusing on?
Our society creates educational products and services to support the mental development of young people.
That's a great idea to help teenagers make them great students.
And how do you see the near future of your company?
In the future, we would like to expand and improve the quality of our products so that we can help students better.
If you'd like to be a part of this, don't call and contact us.
Okay, I'll talk to my partners, and if they're interested, I'll call you.
All right, all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
