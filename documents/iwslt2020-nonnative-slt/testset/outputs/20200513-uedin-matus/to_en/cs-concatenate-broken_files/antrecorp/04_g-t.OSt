So, good day to everyone, my name is <NAME> and I want to..., I would like to introduce you to G and T Ltd..
I'm a manager of the department.
We're from the Czech Republic, and we're students of the business academy.
The company's headquarters are in Nevekla.
I came here today to introduce you... I want... I want to introduce my company.
Our company is a limited-arm company, but we're not a big company.
Our company has seven employees and three departments.
We have business divisions, financial and then management divisions.
Now I'd like to tell you what our company is doing.
Our company makes advertising for other companies.
We're making car sticks, tuxedo sticks, billboards and stuff.
We also make advertising objects.
These are, for example, cards and catalogues.
At the end of my presentation, I would like to thank you for your attention and invite you to our stand, which has a number forty-seven.
Thank you.
