Hello, I'd like to introduce you to Jizeran.
We're from Liberca and we cook beer.
We started as a small group of friends who just wanted to cook beer, but soon we found out that everyone liked it.
We offered our friends and they enjoyed it, so we started taking him abroad and cooking in a big one.
Today we offer four types of beer.
Ten Reichenbier, eleven Reichenbier, Reichenbier thirteen and our specialty, a dark specialty of fifteen.
We offer beer in towels, bottles, bars and five bottles.
Our beer is made of jelly bread.
I'm glad you listened to me, and if you'd like to taste our beer, you can visit us at stand number forty-five.
Thank you.
