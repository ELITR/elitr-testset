Hi, I'm <NAME> and I'm working for Mole GP Technologies in the Communications Department.
Hi, I'm <NAME>, I'm sixteen years old and I work in the marketing department.
For this action we prepared a small scene in the elevator:
Yes, I'm late, I'm working on the last floor for Mole GP Technologies and where are you going?
I'm going home.
Tell me about your company.
Well, Mole GP Technologies is a young company founded in 2018 in Turin by young experts from Pean's high school in Turin.
We offer a range of services such as database management, software development and graphic design.
Besides, we're printing the logs on the writers and pens.
All right, all right, and you're an Italian firm?
Yes, we will help you with your company's development and improve its performance. Thanks to the international background, we can work across Europe.
Yeah, yeah, so you'll help me if I need to?
Yeah, yeah... that's right.
Thank you.
