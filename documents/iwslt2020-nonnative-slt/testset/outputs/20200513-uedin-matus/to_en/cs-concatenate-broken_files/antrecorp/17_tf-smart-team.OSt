Hello, my name is <NAME> and I am the CEO of Smart Team from the Maria Teiulen High School of Economics in Pitești, Romania.
The aim of our company is to provide agrotourism services in tourist areas of Romania and to support tourism potential by being the only market in this area.
After the 2019 Winter Season Market Analysis, we have created an offer for you that you do not like.
We called the package "Discover the Dragon Land."
It offers wonderful experiences in Bran, Poiana Brašov, where Drakula was born.
We offer you three incredible days during which you can rest, have fun, visit the area, photograph and get memories of your entire life.
The first day begins with a visit to the famous Bran castle, or "the castle upriver Drakuly", a place full of mystery.
On the second day, you will enjoy visiting Dino Park, the only dinosaur park in Romania and the largest such park in Southeast Europe.
Another goal will be to discover one of the wonderful creatures of nature, "The Seven Steps of Canyon", which consists of seven waterfalls, of which the highest measures thirty-five meters.
The last day you will have enough time to enjoy twelve meetings because we will provide you with free daily subsistence.
And how much better could you finish your trip than a special photo lesson in Karpatech?
We hope that we have raised your awareness to find out more about our offers and services, and we cannot wait until we meet you at our tent number fifty-eight.
