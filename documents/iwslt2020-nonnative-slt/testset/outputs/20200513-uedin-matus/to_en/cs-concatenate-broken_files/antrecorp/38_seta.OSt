Good afternoon, everyone, my name is <NAME>. And my name is <NAME>.
I would like to introduce you to SETA, which is a short one: smart phones, electronics and technological supplements.
We are a company that sells electronic equipment, such as printers, smart phones and watches.
In addition, we are an international company that communicates in French, English, Dutch and German.
We came to the fair and we have special offers ready for the buyers.
One of the slides concerns the Instax camera.
When you buy this camera, you'll get 100 free photo papers.
It is important to note that we also have quantitative discounts on orders over thirty products.
