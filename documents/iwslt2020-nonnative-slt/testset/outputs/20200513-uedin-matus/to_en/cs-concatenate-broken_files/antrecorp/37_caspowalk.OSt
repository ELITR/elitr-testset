Hello!
What floor are you going to?
Hello, to the fifteenth.
And you?
Twenty-second.
Do you mind if I take my shoes?
Those high heels are destroying me!
Of course I do.
I won't mind.
Thank you.
Why are you wearing high heels when you can wear tennis?
I know a good store that's focused on selling free shoes.
Yeah, really?
Yes, actually, I work for him.
Its name is CaspoWalk Ltd. and we offer different types of footwear from different brands such as Nike, Adidas, for all age categories and sex.
Do you offer any special shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some shoes.
The special offer this month are Danish-type wood, and if you like sports, you would like brand new Nike shoes called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes you control on the phone.
You can modify the bonding of fabrics and the color of LED diodes using the mobile app.
If I bought my shoes at your place, would you offer me some supplements?
Yes, of course.
We offer fabrics and footwear and many more accessories.
Here's my card.
I'm sure you'll stop at our store.
All right, thanks.
You'll find us in this building.
We're taking part in the student company fair.
Thank you so much!
We came to my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
See you later.
Nice to meet you, too.
See you later.
