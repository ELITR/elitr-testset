Good day.
My name is <NAME> and I'm from the fictional Folkstyle company of <CITY>.
I'd like to tell you a few words about our company.
Our Folkstyle company comes from Slovakia and focuses on the production of clothes and fashionable accessories made of traditional Slovak folklore motifs.
Folklore, as you know, has a very long tradition in Slovakia, and that is why we still have rich sources of ideas.
It should be emphasised that all our products are hand-spread.
In our wide range you will find scattered dresses, skirts, bands and also tools or today very popular butterflies - I, by the way, have one right on me.
In our products we draw from popular motifs from different areas of Slovakia.
We are trying to combine these motives with the latest fashion trends to create overtime pieces of clothes that should not be missed in any dress.
We offer products for all age categories that satisfy younger and older customers.
When you order our products, you will not wait for goods for more than thirty days.
Payment may also be in cash by bank transfer.
