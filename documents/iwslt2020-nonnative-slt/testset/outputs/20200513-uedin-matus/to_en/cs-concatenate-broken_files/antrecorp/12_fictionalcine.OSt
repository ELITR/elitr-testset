Ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I am the director of the FictionalCine fictional company that operates cinema, prompts movies and prepares educational programs for schools.
Our company was founded on September 1, 2018.
Our company has... had five members, but at the moment there's only four in it.
Every month we prepare new programs and offers for customers.
As an additional activity, we also offer food to customers.
If you are interested in our educational order, you can contact us by email to fictionalcine, call, gmail, dot, com or visit us at the tent number fifty-five.
We're glad to meet you.
Thank you.
