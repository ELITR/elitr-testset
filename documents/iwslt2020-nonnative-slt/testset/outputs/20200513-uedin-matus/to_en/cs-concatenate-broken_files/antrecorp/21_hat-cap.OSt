Hello, good morning!
Good morning!
I'm sorry...
Oh, my God, that's a great hat.
Of course! This is our main product, we are Hat&Cap from Italy.
I mean... so you make onions?
No, we sell them, we're all young people with innovative ideas.
Teda!
But this is a dechberating hat!
I mean, I think it must be very expensive, it's excellent quality.
Yes, we really use the best materials the market offers, because our goal is the complete satisfaction of the customer.
But how can I buy a hat like that?
Find us on social networks.
You'll find our catalog and business conditions there.
That sounds good!
And also... we're here at the fair, in the tent number ninety-two.
Come visit us!
Really?
I don't think I have to buy a hat.
Goodbye!
Hey, my socks, my socks!
