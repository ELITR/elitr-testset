Good day.
Hey, hey.
But that's a very nice trick.
What's that brand?
Yeah, it's not a brand, it's a logo of my bottle.
Really?
You got a bottle?
Yeah, sure.
It is located in Vltava in the heart of the Czech BudÄ›jovic and offers three rooms.
The first class is called Golden Fishing and belongs to the most luxurious room in our bottle.
Then we have the second class, the Red Fisher, and the third class called the Bronze Fisher.
I mean, do you offer any special rooms?
Yes, we do.
We have a special room for lovers to celebrate the anniversary and so on.
I mean, do you have a restaurant?
Yes, we do.
We have a restaurant for customers where the public can come, but our customers eat it for free.
And if you stay in our restaurant longer than you want - you know, it can happen - then you can use our fitness centre with the latest equipment.
I mean, I'm sorry, but I don't like fitness, don't you guys like massages?
Well, if you really don't like fitness, then you can visit our recreation centre where we offer massages, saunas, massage of lava rocks and more.
Well, yeah, I like that, great!
And if I can add, there's free Wi-Fi throughout the bottle and free parking for guests.
Well, thank you.
I hope you visit us.
I'm sure so.
