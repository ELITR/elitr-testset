Good afternoon, we're Mela e Piu, we're from <ADRESA> and now we're singing you a song...
Mela and Piu, apple for you, apple for you - Mela and Piu!
Hey, buddy, this rap is really good!
We're from Italian school - this trip to Prague is dense.
We have a tent here and we represent the brand.
Mela e Piu - apple for you, apple for you - Mela e Piu.
Our valley is called di Non, from which we come.
Apple cake, apple juice, cookies, quartz, apple cream.
Tasty, sweet and excellent, ideal wedding, natural, nutritious.
Mela and Piu, apple for you, apple for you - Mela and Piu.
Mmmmm, so good, but don't worry, our products are organic.
They continue in a long tradition, but we also add innovation.
Mela and Piu, apple for you, apple for you.
