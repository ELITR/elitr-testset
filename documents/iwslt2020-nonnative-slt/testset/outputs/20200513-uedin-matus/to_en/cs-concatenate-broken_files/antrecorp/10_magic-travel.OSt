Hello!
Hello!
You work for the travel office?
Because I saw your jacket.
Yes, I work for a travel office in Vienna, called Magic Travel.
I'm planning on taking a trip with my girlfriend.
We offer romantic excursions, but if you're more of an adventure couple, we also offer sports and culinary excursions.
We're more than romantic.
We offer trips to Russia, Spain and England.
If you'd like to look at our catalog...
Yes.
I mean, that's interesting.
Which one would you recommend?
I would recommend Verona because it's a city of love, and I think your girlfriend would really like it.
If you have any further questions, I'll give you our card that you can contact us at any time.
But I have to admit, I don't have a girlfriend, and on a romantic journey, I'd like to go with you.
I think we'll meet again at the office.
