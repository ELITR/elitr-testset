<CENSORED>, are you on duty?
Shall I start?
Yes.
Yeah, ha ha ha ha, I'm sorry.
First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your conference on electronic data.
The right to access government information is a fundamental democratic right.
To this end, it is necessary for the government to share public information.
Since the entry into force of the law, the company has changed a lot.
Information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
In time, virtually all people started using the Internet, often on more devices.
The government of the twenty-first century can respond to these tasks by providing the public with direct access to government information.
In other words, the government could actively publish the open data.
In such a case, the volume of open data should be assessed in the context of the transition to digital governance.
At the same time, the pace in this area is given here by the United Kingdom, together with the United States.
Obviously, these countries do not regard the open data as a target or as a means of achieving greater transparency.
From a global point of view, they take the lead in terms of an open government partnership.
This is an initiative that should make the government as open as possible.
And there are a number of European directives and treaties in Europe that are important for legislation and open data policy.
The Dutch government also has a considerable ambition in the area of open data and has adopted new rules.
However, the actual implementation is still in the back.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former President, Mrs Stuiveling, see great potential in the open data.
In 2013, we decided to monitor the development of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We conducted a research aimed at the determination of ministries to apply an open data policy.
Our approach is positive, because we have focused on the ministry that has done well, and on the contrary, we have tried to encourage the ministry that has remained.
By meeting experts on open data and public officials and publishing good examples of information reviews at national and international level.
In the second report, we underlined the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers the government opportunities.
By openly informing the government of its expenditure and performance, it will have a better idea of its own financing.
This will change the way Parliament monitors the government.
Open data sets would increase transparency and government access for citizens.
From a commercial point of view, innovative entrepreneurs can transfer open data to new applications.
One of our objectives was to find what the Netherlands could learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Using data for an open data biometer conducted by the World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of the open data.
Information on ensuring positive results from government initiatives on open data.
The extent to which data are available.
And the impact on society, economy and government.
ehm society, economy and government.
And if we compare... excuse me.
Excuse me.
My voice on the monitor is kind of connected.
I'm pretty upset.
All right, all right.
We can continue.
Comparing the United Kingdom and the United States with the Netherlands,
based on this, the UK and the US, taking into account implementation and impact better.
With regard to their readiness to open data, there is only a small difference between them.
On the contrary, the Netherlands is well prepared for worse.
This concerns only the right to information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the United Kingdom and the United States publish much more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data files is huge in the United States.
The type of data published by the country differs from the number of points.
The Netherlands is currently publishing only a few open data on government expenditure and public procurement.
Nor is the Dutch trade register too open.
On the contrary, as you can see, Britain has open data in all areas.
The impact of open data is political, social and economic.
From a social and economic point of view, the Netherlands remains behind the UK and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands is less using open data to involve citizens in the creation and control of government policy.
The economic benefit of open data is only very small.
In both our reports, we have set out international examples that can be a good example for the Netherlands.
In Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on hospital waiting times.
We didn't just call for open data barometers.
And we did our own research.
And to make a better idea of the currently available volume and type of open data
We looked at the data published on our national open file portal.
A total of 15,000 data files were available in February.
And more than half of the data files were provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by the central government comes from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands is the Ministry of Public Works.
In the case of our two reports, we have asked all ministries what steps they are taking to publish the open data.
The scores we gave each ministry were based on six indicators.
This was, for example, support from the Ministry's management and the entity's action plan.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have adopted exceptional initiatives to publish the open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and what funding it provided in the year two thousand fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice did not have time or money to publish public data.
However, the other ministry has entrusted several employees with the publication of open data and has released the budget for these activities.
On the basis of the study of the years, we have reached the conclusion that the open data is a standard, but are not yet in practice.
And given what was lawful about open data, it was mainly about governments, what the government knows, rather than what the government does.
We also received a few comments that rely on the success of open data policy.
And the government should better inform about what data are available.
They should create the right conditions, the right conditions for the open data.
And the third was that the government must invest in both; on the other hand, offers and requests for open data.
For example, setting up an open data institute.
For our report for the year two thousand and fifteen, we have found that the government and the ministry have taken steps to increase the acceptance of open data.
Partially in response to our first open data report, the Ministry of the Interior is currently coordinating the entire government data file analysis.
The Netherlands follows the good examples set by the United Kingdom and the United States.
There was an accident.
We also found that the open data provided through the national portal was unilateral.
Almost all open data files are geo-data, geographic data and almost all are published by one ministry.
Only very few data are important for public control of government finances and government activity is available.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account in the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch Government should therefore define objectives and milestones in a specific action plan.
We also think that opening data should be mandatory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
It should determine which data are of the greatest social importance and what data should be available in any case.
And the government should use the open data itself, for example in decentralizing social networks.
In the Netherlands, this is a major national programme in which responsibility is transferred from central government to the municipality.
Our reports have had a positive impact.
The Ministry of the Interior will publish the results of the national data survey within this month.
The House adopted a proposal for a national information infrastructure.
And on the basis of the data inventory, the Ministry of the Interior will set up a national open data agenda.
It will publish in this agenda what data will be opened and when they will be opened.
We're trying to set an example.
On our websites we have published our own expenses so that everyone can see why the Dutch Court of Auditors is wasting their money.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open expenditure.
The Ministry of Finance is now planning to make detailed data on expenditure available to the government next year.
All right, all right.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is evolving positively and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor developments,
Thank you for your attention.
In case of your interest, you can find our reports on our website in English and data on our expenditure in Dutch.
