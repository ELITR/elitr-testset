Hello fellas, my name is <NAME> and I am your host for today's infomercial which is presented by the most famous practice firm, straight outta Austria, Total Regal.
We have conquered the market all the way since nineteen ninety nine and we have crushed other firm's dreams also.
So, in fact our chief executive officer has led this successful organization before some of you all weren't even born yet.
Think about that.
So we are our... where are our headquarters located?
They are obviously in the mountains.
No just kidding, we actually do have real cities besides Vienna.
And, our dress code?
Short skirts and leather shorts, no just kidding.
But we actually might crack up our traditional clothes at some of the countless parties that we have, to have one beer or something.
Alright make that two beers.
So, why should you buy our products?
We have been selling our most popular products, which have become really iconic by the way, since nineteen ninety nine, so two decades.
And... Like the Helping Hand, which is a perfect storage for any kind of clothes, just like jackets, or the Spacewonder where you can stack up shoes and bags.
So go check out our store and like we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
So, we would like to continue and I kindly ask the Belgian court of auditors to present the presentation.
Ok, so hereby I present our state of play.
We have two national laws in order to european regulation so two directives.
One is about paper and digital publications.
They have the same rate now.
And on a certain circumstances it is zero rate and under other circumstances it is six percentage.
For real estate rental, we have adopted a fat option for renting off properties of their nature and mandatory VAT for short term rental of a property.
Then we have executed two audits.
One is about MOS which we have heard already several times, so I will be very brief about it.
Another one is for a registered cas cash register system.
And then we have also two new four trends.
So, our audit about MOS is not finished, yet it is not already published.
A so, all conclusions and recommendations are just preliminary.
But we are very confident that there won't be any big changes.
M m.
In our conclusions, they are very much the same as what we have already heard today.
But for us, I just will point out some things that are different, but which are more or less specific for Belgium, I think.
We have in our administration just limited staff for the moment, because we are more or less a or a receiver than a an MSID that transfers money, and we rely very much on on the other member states.
But in the future when the MOS will be extended there will be need for more staff.
And that staff should be already be trained now and foreseen now.
Another general conclusion we had was it, but which we already heard more or less is that there's a change of control policy.
Which has to take place it's new state of mind.
But our administration is very confident in the other MSID's, because when we look at the conclusions as MSCON.
Just jump from one to another.
We see that there is very poor control policy.
So we are very confident every MSID will send or transfer the money.
That is due to us.
Nevertheless, we pointed out that it was important to make progress in some way of control policy by making risk profiles.
For now our administration has not been able to make very good risk profiles because they don't have enough data, but they think they will.
I have more data in the future and could make some risk profiles so this is something we will follow up in the in the future if the control policy will be better.
Another point which is more or less specific.
We do monitor other taxpayers on the internet, so there is a system to find taxpayers on the internet.
But for now the results are rather poor.
There's not much taxpayer stuff they have found.
Then, we see that the...
As an MSIDD registration procedure is as such as ok, but in circumstances where taxpayers are de-registered.
There is no follow up if they are put in and declaration in the regular system.
So, there is no link or no follow up system, which we still think is important.
Then we have with the in the declaration procedure.
There are some automatic checks, which we think is very interesting.
So it's not a real control of completeness and correctness (yeah thank you) of completeness and correctness.
But it still helps when common errors are made.
So, the real controls are have to be done by MSCON but as an MSID, but Belgium is still helping to fill out the declaration, so there are certain mistakes.
There will be an alert in the system or when you have to make choices all choices are limited and you have just you can click on the possible choices so there will be a less mistakes.
We also discovered as an MSCON that they are working in the Benelux.
So with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg they have made matrix of a certain risks and are developing now control activities.
In function of those risks and there are already two test files that has have started up for now.
So, we recommended to work further in this little group to make progress there and to expand the knowledge to European forums.
I think that's about the the differences we had from what we didn't hear hear before.
So, we'll go to do a second audit.
There has been an audit for register cash register system.
This is not an audit that was conducted by <CENSORED> and I, but by other members of the audit cell.
It was also audit, which was a big bit broader than only VAT, but i will only present the conclusions and recommendations that, are important for VAT.
The audit questioned was about the efficiency and effectiveness of control policy.
The installation and the application, so they looked at at two problems concerning the cash register system.
And the impact the system had for the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations were they concluded that the recommendation regulation are too complex.
And so the recommendation was to simplify it, because there were so many exceptions in the regulation the national regulation.
That it was very difficult difficult to determine a certain group just on the basis of the declaration alone.
And so it was very difficult to monitor or to control certain groups of companies that had to install the register cash register system.
Another big conclusion was the control policy.
There are problems with the selections of the taxpayers of the register cash register system taxpayers.
When there was a threshold, there is a threshold and when the declaration is too low, the you will fall under the just threshold and there will be no control, so this was a way to a escape from the legislation.
Also, there was a problem of cross-checking information data out of databases for the selection of taxpayers for to control them.
Another conclusion was that there were poor internal controls as well for the application of the system.
As the fines that were given, so they discovered that different control units gave different fines.
So there was not there were prescriptions for fines, but some were very strict and other control teams were not strict at all or they had fines are way below the rates that were giving for certain certain faults also the risk analysis and online access.
Would be an advantage, but it's not implemented now so risk analysis was very basic and there is no online access but since we learned that a this kind of system exists in other countries when they do have a online access.
They discovered that it could be a very good advantage.
Then there was also the exchange of information with the national social security office which was not very very good.
So a lot of information didn't pass from one to another.
Finally about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with the entering of transactions
So, the system as such works very fine if it's use when it's used like it has to be used, but when certain transactions were not entered in the system they could not be discovered.
So solution could be to have a media campaign for the customers to ask for a ticket.
So this would make sure that every transaction would be entered in the system.
Otherwise they will not a be a ticket or that the legislation would be adapted to that only electronic payments would be accepted because then it would be more easy to follow the money.
But as a real impact there is no reliable measurement of the administration of the impact, so they have no idea.
And then our team has done some tests and has tried to find some impact, but they discovered there was an anticipation effect, since the introduction of the system was delayed for a few years.
But everybody knew it was coming, so customers and also the companies already anticipated on the legislation that was are going to change and on the introduction of the system.
So it was very difficult to see the exact differences between the VAT income before 2016, when the system was introduced and after.
Because already a few years there before 2016 VAT returns were augmenting just in view of the of the new system which would change.
So our team was not sure of the effect.
This was only about this system or that the effect was even even bigger, because it started earlier than they thought.
<CENSORED>, may I interrupt, just, I have a problem, or I would like to understand it correctly.
What do I have to understand under this a term registered cash register system?
Does it mean that this, this cash register system is somewhere in a database registered?
No, it's not it's not an online, it's it's a cash a yeah "kasa".
Yeah, ok, so it's it's just an cafes, hotels, restaurants.
It's only for a certain branch.
It's only in the Horeca branch for now and it's a system that registers every transaction or should register every projection that is inputted into the system.
(So, the) There is no online access.
So when that's why the selection of the control group is very important because the control teams have to go the different places.
They can't look at it online on a computer they have to go to the Horeca and connect their computer to their cash register.
So then they get the data out of it and they do the controls.
Yes, but they can't do it from a distance.
They always have to go to the premises themselves.
So when and that's why when a declaration is too low and is under the threshold.
The teams won't go there to see only if they would know the café, for instance and they know there is a lot of customers and they are not in it but that's just a coincidence.
But that's something they discovered only later, so they will be they.
Thank you, <CENSORED>, for your question, because I was worried that I am the only one I'm not understanding this is.
Ok, but what is the difference then between this system you are talking about the cash register system in any seller I mean in a grocery.
Then, what is the special thing in this particular system you're there.
There is a special software in it that provides any possibility of fraud with the system and it it it's software also make sure that the data is transferable to the computer of the control teams.
While a a regular a cash register system you can't extract the data in the same way.
So this a cash register systems that are have a.
Yeah, they are special too, but there are there I think it there are five different marks of cash's cash register systems out of which you can choose and they have a certification.
That all data that is extractable, that the formats of the data is good for the control teams to analyze.
Yeah, yeah, so the compatibility is is certified that's the main domain different section.
Yeah, you mentioned this risk analysis there was like a lack of risk service analysis or they were not performance all or.
I mean online access access to this analysis or?
Online access to the the cash register system itself.
Ok, so which could made controls are far more easy ok and because then we can do automatic controls or extraction of of data.
Which could be put into a bigger system and the risk analysis was very very basic, actually, because they they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or this a system was only introduced in 2016, so they only had two years of data to work with.
Ok, to finish.
I have two new fraud trends of our administration.
First one was discovered during an operation which was called matrimony, it was a registration of many foreign companies.
But always by the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulgarian.
But they registered on the names that were very similar to known names.
There was just one letter of difference and just to make it plausible that these companies existed, but most of them did not exist at all.
And then they had did just a declaration of VAT and asked for VAT refund with false invoices, but they always did this declaration by paper and for very small amounts.
Which means that a the administration had to put in all the information themselves into the system, which took time.
And therefore there were already done some refunds before they could actually discover that there was the possibility of fraud and and could control it if the company was really existing, and if the invoices war were real.
But this kind of fraud was discovered and the information is spread via EUROFISC, so I I think that every tax administration now is aware of this kind of fraud.
Another a fraud was in green power certificates, so very similar to the certificates for CO3-2 in the the past.
This was a scheme more or less in the same sense that they were sending in voices.
Or using in voices for a firm that resembled very much of the legal firm that should send the invoice.
So we had a scheme I've had made it very short and didn't make it any a picture of it.
But I will explain it like this.
So, it was a company A in a member state X that by certificates from B in another member state A, and then they would sell it these certificates to company C.
Again another member state Z and send to this company an invoice from a accorded A-accent.
So, that's the company name that has just one letter of difference with the original one.
So, that the company C wouldn't see that there is actually fraud going on.
And of course this a company A and company A-accent were the same managers that have this a A company and the A-accent would be a missing trader.
I hope this kind of schemes is clear.
That was the end of my presentation.
If you do not mind.
I would like to ask you, the Polish colleagues to give the presentation.
Thank you.
And ehm, just let me refresh my, ehm em so I would like tell a few two words about the new regulations, new tools implemented last year and during this year.
Ehm some of them e were presented during our plennary session at Warsaw last year.
So those of you, who are em in Warsaw you you know it briefly.
So I'd just would like only just to briefly recall some of them, and then I will tell you about our previous audit on this area and our findings.
So the first eeem legislation to I  would like to mention is the single audit file.
The introduction of this tools started three years ago.
But last year was the year of the final stage, because the first stage was that em eee the single audit file was em that was obligatory to present it to the tax administration on demand.
And now this is the automatic system.
And ehm the information must be submitted by electronic means without any request.
And since the 1st July on the of last year.
Ahm this is this is obligatory for all type of ehm business entities.
And since eh ehm eeem 2016.
There was obligatory for bigger  companies, then for medium one, smaller one and now for all enterprises.
Eee I will come back to this too, because we find it as a most significant in the in in the area of combating VAT shorts.
The second legislation I would like to mention is so called "fuel package", eem and again, em the leg legislation was introduced step by step.
Depends on the type of the entity and the idea is that licence for fuel trading is granted only to entities, who which are established in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign entities registered for VAT, V A T, in their countries, the same type of entities are allowed to benefit from their excise duty suspension procedures respecting the intra community acquisition of fuel, and em the VAT resulted from em intra community acquisition of fuel will have to be paid immediately after the goods are shipped to Poland or excise duty suspension procedure is finished.
Ehm ee the next legislation, is ehm that transport package ehm.
Eem I may say that eem the draft of law was based the on our Hungarian colleagues experiences.
Because as a as we know the the the first law this ty type of law, was introduced in Hungary, and em but in Poland we introduced this system of the monitoring of the carriage of goods for only particular types some some categories of goods.
Ehm generally speaking, the the goods, which are a subject of excises.
I mean the fuel, tobacco and some others and the monitoring means the monitoring of the eeem ehm em of the transportation of this goods by public roads or by rail.
Aa that means that every single ehm transport must be notified before the transport begin, aaa in the special system, dedicated system and since last year, moreover the em every transport em is connected with the geolocation system.
So every particular truck is possible to be to be verified, where is it.
About the the routes, the parking places et cetera.
And the Minister of Finance ehm for the Ministry of Finance that analyses of the whole system of the big data is provided by online, one of the public institute, and so as we know for now, they the they have up they could ehm they could ehmm take many results and many ehm they could find any irregularities, and they could find the business entity which are which em provides such a transport in a in a kind which are abtnormal in the meaning of routes, of the time et cetera.
And this year we are planning to audit the Ministry of Finance.
How the Ministry of Finance is prepared to ehm ehm to verify and to use the this analyses, because the the system is implemented in the meaning that em this sounds that all these entities have to em to register all transportation and the system is ready in the meaning of the ame analysation whi which are on go ongoing in online.
But we are not know for the moment if the Minister of Finance em uses this information to any action taken by the tax administratio, the tax administration.
Em next legislation is ehm em something similar to our em tech colleague presented yesterday.
Em so we have got a kind of blacklist but in Poland a blacklist means the list of the entities that have been removed of the from the VAT register.
Ahm and we have a system of ehmm based on the information, ehm given again online by banks and the the other eem em entities of the financial system.
And this system allows to em to the service of Minister of Finance to ehm to identify, any irregulari irreg ir irregularities, and ehm em the system is aimed at capturing abnormal transactions and provide information about them to the tax tax authorities eeem eehm online.
And based on this information, the tax administration a may a block the account, the bank account and the particular transaction.
What is a risk of extortion of the amount higher than ehhm emm 10000 euro.
Next legislation is split payment, introduced last year.
For the moment this is the emmm eee the option.
But in fact, this is the option for the em purchaser.
If the one part of the contract use this, then the the the way of the paying is mandatory for supplier, obviously.
And what is important, that i if this split payment mechanism is used, then the joint and several liability of taxpayer is excluded.
Aaa and I will show some num I will tell you about some numbers about using this split may payment machanism in a second.
And the, yeah last but one aam legislation and organizational ehm tools while our colleague from the Ministry of Finance presented it last year quite deeply.
So we've got new National Revenue Administration, a based on ehm em previous free administration and now we have got one em administration combating the em the tax, and the custom administration in one system.
And online registration system.
Ha ha ha.
Ehm for the moment, we've got the em, the obligatory type of cash registers system and the obligatory elements of these cash registers, ahm ehm ee is the electronic memory.
So the tax administration is able to verify on the base of the memory of the authorises authorised type of the cash registers, but we are starting with the system of online registration system for some ehm sectors only.
Em first of all the eem legal services, medical services, em fuels em only some particular sectors.
And that means a preparing to build a central system kept by the Head of the National Revenue Administration.
A in this system, all these transactions should be registered immediately online simply.
And so we are applying discussing to to implement possibly is the split payments ahm ahm for all sensiv, sensitive taxpayers.
Aa that means in fact that we would like the tax administration would like to the em to replace the reverse charge, ehm by this split payments mechanism and the reverse charge and the joint and several liability.
So in all those sectors which within which eeem in which the s eem reverse charge or join all or several liability ehm ee are binding, all these sectors could be covered by this split payment mechanism.
And em as I mentioned I will say a few words about our audit.
Ehm we conducted the audit last year.
The term was ehm the period covered by the audit was quite long, because it was a em a twelve years, we were asked by the k f committee of finance of public finance of the the same of the Polish Chamber of the Parliament to conduct such a audit and a ehmm.
Our findings were as follow.
We had to to state that the the efficiency of the activity of Ministry of Finance during this long period was di differ  different during the em sub periods of this of this of thi of these years.
During the years 2010 2015 em some insufficient in our opinion efforts ehm were taken by the Ministry and the tax administration to improve their efficiency of the VAT revenues.
Mmm one of the indication, because the the  subject of the audit was the supervision of the Ministry of Finance over the em over the tax incomes over the tax em collections, the VAT collection.
And one of the the indication of efficas eficaftne eficass efficasy efficiency sorry of this supervision.
Eeem is there ehm VAT gap.
And during this years  the VAT gap in Poland was on average 24 pierc percent, which was about ten point higher than the medium level of the EU countries.
So that was one of the indication for us that the supervision was not ehm eem ehm effectively contacted.
Mmmm yeah here we've got.
It is possible to say we've got the information about, ehm the VAT gap in Poland and EU countries and eem we ve've got the numbers ehm by the the aam European Commission and Polish Ministry of Finance.
Ehm and as you can see the average European VAT gap is definitely lower than in Poland despite the source of the information the numbers are quite clear here.
Mmmm.
And as I said the main tool in our  and the tax administration as well opinion ahm implemented during this period, was the single audit file, and ehm during the last two years, the tax administration gained the ehm competences to use the databases to analyse them.
And ahm for example, in 2017, four millions of invoices were analyses automatically but only 30000 of warnings were as a result of these analysation process.
Last year, the number of invoices analyses what not too higher, because about five millions, but there are more than 350000 of warnings.
At that gave an efact in in incomes comes because the the first  say am stage is the automatic analysing and then the warning means the warning sent by text messages or e-mails.
So without any official procedure in a tax procedure et cetera.
A and that system ehm, this first stage,  automatic stage, gaves us the results in the incomes, incomes of VAT more than 150 millions euro yearly.
During these last two years, 2017 and 2018.
Eemm the increase in income took place in the conditions of good economic situation and improve VAT collection, resulting from the wide package of legislative and organizational changes introduces during the last years.
But still we think that one of the main source of these results that financial results is the the implementation of this single audit file.
Aaa the results of the the other tool this split may payment mechanise was as follow in 2018  the use of split payment mechanism as I said was voluntary.
But we observe the increased interest in payment in this form.
In July of the last year, taxpayers made em ssss 600 no, sorry, eee yeah, 600000 transa transactions.
In December more than one and half million of transactions using the split payment mechanism.
The value of tax paid using this split payment mechanism in July, that was half of a billion Euro.
In December 1 and half billion euro.
Overall in the period from July to December of the last year, taxpayers carried out more than seven million transactions using the split payment mechanism, and the amount of tax on special accounts for VAT amounted to to approximately six billions euros.
And so eem eem one more information about eem, aaa the tax administration activity aaaa last year the thaam the national tax, the national revenue as ministration carried out 30 percent less controls than in 2017, however, with fewer inspections, the percentage of inspection, in which irregularities were found, increased.
Aaa we think that this is a result of this introduced new electronic tools aa which helped to identify the entity to be properly choose to be a subject of control.
Eeeem the decrease in number of controls was accomplishe aam as  I said by aa increase number in the naaaaaaa oh sorry the the decrease in  the number of controls was accompanion accompaigned by th an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is obviously less painful and aaaaa time consuming for taxpayers.
Aaa and it resulted in increase of finding by 100 percent in last year comparing with the 2017.
So generally, in our opinion of the last few years in Poland was the term of implementation of the several ehmmm eee legislation.
And in total, the results are ehm sufficient.
However, we still have to remember that the economic ehmeeee surrounding ehm were quite well.
So it is hard to divide the source of this incomes between this.
The results of the new organisation and legislation tools.
And just the results of the general economy.
That is all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions, we will try to answer...
Any more questions from your side?
If not then I would kindly invite our Romanian colleagues to proceed.
Ok, hello.
Can you hear me?
Yeah?
So in Romania we still have the nineteen percent VAT tax, that we had for the last two years.
And even though there were plans to, for it to drop to eighteen percent, this has been postponed for now.
Beside that we have two reduced VAT rates, the nine percent and the five percent.
And the the past year have been some changes regarding the the products that can have the reduced rate.
So we have the biggest change was with sewage that was changed from nineteen percent to nine percent starting first of January this year.
The others remained the same.
And for the five percent there were bit, a lot of changes, mainly some of the products that were at nine percent have been dropped to five percent.
The biggest one was, the last one was from the first of June this year, regarding high quality foods, and mountain products, equal, and traditional products.
And for that the products have to be manufactured on a mountain or like the cows or the sheep have to live there at least half their lifes.
And the the manufacturer has to get them authorisation, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
So that he can apply the reduced rate.
Next we have like the reversed tax mechanism.
In Romania, both companies have to be registered in order to be applicable.
There are fourteen products for which it can be reduced and in December two thousand eighteen for some of them the the deadline has be prolonged until twenty twenty two.
Finally, we also have the split VAT system, which was introduced in two thousand seventeen, although now it kind of looks a bit abandoned by the Ministry of Finance.
Because it started with four hundred plus companies in two thousand seventeen and now in two thousand nineteen the number dropped to, by, forty six percent.
Like no new companies started using the system in two thousand eighteen.
So all the companies that started initially have since started dropping the system and returning to the normal VAT system.
Plus the the European Commission did the Romania to stop using this system.
So it looks like it hasn't reached its potential so the Ministry is probably gonna stop using it altogether.
Totally?
This is from the data that we have, I mean, like no new companies have been registered in two thousand eighteen and not, and also not in two thousand nineteen.
So only the companies that started in two thousand seventeen are in the system, and they're slowly decreasing in numbers.
Regarding all that findings there are still some regulatory gaps, regarding the MOSS system which in Romania is M one SS for some reason because they translated the one.
But that's how it was.
And also there's, there are, lacks in the IT systems with the, in the, tax department cooperating between themselves and exchanging data.
Which doesn't make it easier for companies, and the the last year they finally introduced the electronic machine, a machine, like the ones in Belgium.
They set the electronic cash registers and the companies are now obligated to start using them so the tax the tax authorities going and controlling them to see if everybody installed them.
But for now it's we are not really sure if the system is fully operational because of limits in the IT system on the part of the tax department.
And no new trends have been have been identified as of now.
So that's it.
Thank you.
Okay, so, we have made this audit.
The audit report is about to be published the 16th of July.
So, please keep this information confidential.
Under embargo until the date of publication.
We are just waiting for the replies of the commission in all the 23 official language of the EU.
Because we have the reply only in English, so this is only a formality and the audit is it's over now.
The title was “Many of the challenges o-o-of” that special report will be “Many of the challenges of collecting VAT in custom duties remain to be resolved”.
Remain to be resolved.
Originally it was “remain to be addressed”, but to some extent they have been addressed with new pieces of legislation new proposal made by the commission that just the <CENSORED> referred to.
But they remain still the problems that there's an issues that remain to be resolved and we will see later.
Then, I will start with why we have chosen this topic for the for the audit.
What do we look at.
They are finding something.
We'll finish with our recommendations.
First of all, ok, we carried out the survey, because we follow the previous research analysis.
Based on the findings of the superintendent of these institutions in the field of e-commerce there were some audits by the German colleagues, by the Lithuanian colleagues.
Also in a previously determined that we made on imports we analyze the problem of the distance from non-EU countries and the related problems concerning VAT and custom duties and we decided that it was worth it to go deeper during this audit.
The problem here is that the honest traders are frequently expelled from the market by dishonest traders and they cannot compete anymore.
This is a problem that have been raised also by a representative of the academia like professor Rita de la Feria and it's especially intensive in the United Kingdom.
Also the estimates about losses.
There are only estimates concerning the distances from non-EU countries.
But these estimates are not very encouraging because, ok, while the commission have made an estimate of only five billion per year, in the UK is between one and one point five billion pounds per year.
They have estimated these losses.
This represents between eight and ten percent of the VAT cut in the United Kingdom.
But be careful, because anti-fraud represent currently only four percent.
So we have three times the volume of the anti-fraud in the UK is represented the losses of e-commerce of goods purchased from non-EU countries.
So this is a mission.
We are not counting here the intra-EU distance sales, we are not counting here the most electronic services.
So the matter is raise our concerns.
Then what we look at of course is a we visit five member states - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we took into account the number of registration for the MOS both in the non-EU and the US schemes.
Also the volume of intra-EU intra-EU e-commerce sales and finally the estimated amount of the VAT foregone as a consequence of the low value consignment relief.
Following on a study of our source by the commission, we also visited the commission.
These acts should debug the technology and the World Customs Organizations and the deleted period ran from 2015 until the end of 2018.
But we took into account also the new pieces of legislation on the proposal made and all the proposal that will enter into force in 2021.
What do we look at?
Of course, we we started analyzing the replies to our survey the survey that was sent by core group two.
We continue with questionnaire in all the member states that we visited with interviews with all possible people.
We got access, and this is very important too, set up a ABC data access to the Synergia database the database of incidents, and problems that tickets reported by member states on the MOS.
We got the access to all the fiscali project groups and electronic groups concerning e-commerce and all the BUT related project groups, that there is a lot of information and discussion concerning the functioning of the MOS.
And of course we got the finance from the support of the institutions of Germany, of the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally we carried out our own samples on different transactions.
On the whole, we summoned nearly nine hundred transactions related to e-commerce.
What do we fi, what we find here, of course, they were first the positive things and then we will continue with the most negative things.
The regulatory framework follow the international best practice that having extremes by the OECD and the World Customs Organization.
In most respects concerning the OECD, they principle of taxation at a destination has been respected in most cases except for that.
Now, there is a new threshold below tenth thousand euro you can report in the member state of origin so this is not complying with the OECD.
For the World Customs Organization that deals with the packages imported the immediate release guidelines have been followed in most respects and also the new proposal the framework of the standards.
The commission is pioneer in this and they align in most respects with the World Customs Organization and standards.
Concerning the new provision that will enter in 2021...
I aim to resolve some of the weaknesses, but for us the main problem that it will continue to happen is undervaluation.
Their the losses on VAT and custom duties are experience and will continue to do.
And this cannot be tackle with the proposal of a chain of information with payment service providers.
As far as the trade with non-EU countries is concerned, this won't be solved and we will see later why.
Why, yes, because administrative cooperation arrangement with non-EU countries they don't work.
We have the new agreement with Norway. This is fine.
We are the we're expecting a change of information with Norway that this will work, but this is not the problem.
It's not Norway, the problem, is China, it's the United States.
Then, the chain of information with China is not working, because the Chinese counterpart, they do not reply and the percentage of reply is dropping and dropping and dropping so that's the the problem.
If we have information about a change of supplier, who is not operating using electronic interface, so is operating directly in his website, who is not registering for the MOS or even register and then we revoke the registration, he will open a new website...
So, how come we are paying the VAT from Europe to China, and we expect that VAT will be will come back to EU.
If we don't have the administrative cooperation too.
This will never happen.
That's the problem even between EU countries is not working as expected.
The administrative cooperation too, so we will see later on then the controls carried out by national tax authorities are weak.
Because there is practically no tools to carried out a proper risk analysis of a chance has mentioned before.
And for this we will be necessary that the member state approve the proposal of the commission to change information with the payment service providers being in the control of the commission are insufficient.
And we will see later, of course the commission had not carried out any monitoring on that no monitoring.
Then there are weaknesses in the custom electronic clearance systems.
Of course, the traditional problem is that the traders undervalued the goods, so to be below the twenty, two or ten year euro threshold for the VAT.
And this will disappear in the future, but they will continue to undervalue in order to pay less VAT.
It won't be assented, but they will pay less and concerning custom duties, the assumption is set at one hundred fifty euros and they cannot manage.
Because in all the electronic we will see later electronic clearance system of the EU they are not able to stop the declaration.
Because they tick on the custom electronic in the box that they apply for the customer electronically for the custom relief.
And they asserted the system even if they declared a value, which is above one hundred and fifty.
The electronic system are not able to stop it they have said that and this is something very serious because the operators that are working there are hopeful economic operators.
So, the big couriers, they have an authority economic operators association and they purport to be the most reliable, but they are abusing the system.
An enforcements of collection of VAT custom duties is not effective.
Ok, the provisions for the a chain of information on the recovery of claims related to that tax.
They have rarely been used of the five member states that we have visited only in Austria.
Only in five occasions, so it's not frequently uses.
There are mismatches of payments between member states we analyze.
We have access to the reconciliation carried out by the commission and there are still missed matches.
Important means much between member states.
There is of course the problem in the Netherlands, that they are not able to reconcile, that has explained the VAT amounts received with the VAT returns.
And there are problems also with the reminders that also our colleagues from the NKU yesterday, they.
They supposed problem with the reminders by the member states of consumption that are not made.
So here is the summary of our findings related to the MOS samples.
We concluded that the MOS IT infrastructure is fit for its purposes, so is strong.
It can handle the user, so the IT infrastructure is is sound but there are problems with the registrations and payments between member states.
Concerning for example we analyze the incidence reported in the Synergia, in the Synergia database between member states but there are only a few twenty-two cases in the five member states.
That we visited, in which the member state with the the already origin of the problem and as affecting member state.
There were only twelve cases, so there there were not so many cases the problem is that the attitude for member states was really passive.
Only when the issues escalated they started working on that, but they it take long periods to solve issues.
Regarding MOS, it takes long periods, but there are not many issues.
Also for the technical error messages sent and received between member states also the reaction is very passive is not is not proactive only when the issue escalate as an incident they start reacting.
But this the infrastructure for the MOS is robust.
We have not assessed whether they are prepared for the one stop shop.
This is something else, we received some complaints, especially from Austria.
They say that they won't be ready, also from the Netherlands path we have not analyzed, because the the system is developing in particular for custom, using the import one stop shop.
There are problem with registrations is with here.
We have to differentiate within the non-US scheme and the EU scheme, a merely eighty percent of the application for registrations, were not properly controlled were not properly controlled.
Regarding the knowing non-US scheme and we even be found, we have found cases of double registrations, which is something serious, then concerning the payments is especially the problem of the lack of remainder issues by the member state of consumption.
And sometimes by the member state of identifications.
And problems with the registrations and cancellation of the registration.
This is for the most regarding the administrative cooperation this are the exchange of information between the member states that we visited.
And we compare here with the the total activity of the chains of information we can see that the, for example there are total requirements for information that have been sent for a hundred eighty two compared with the total requirements of information.
Not related to the common in general is nine thousand two hundred, so as the e-commerce is even be many are even more problematic in the United Kingdom, for example, three times more problematic.
The level of a chain of information is good he is very low, also some member states don't they have changed not entertain reason why we recommend to have separates CNO centralized home office.
Separated structure devoted to e-commerce or to at least to MOS, so the level of chain of information is very weak.
Then we have the multilateral controls, there were six cases of multilateral controls in two cases.
It was really successful experience.
But in two cases it was not successful at all, because the member state of identification refused to participate in the multilateral control.
This is something that is supposed to be solved with the new legislation enforced, because now two member states can request to carry out a control.
And then the other is is a recent request the other member state the member state of identification that it cannot refuse to participate.
So, hopefully, we will see it will be improved, but there are other things important for EUROFISC.
There were four hundred and eighty signals a chain through EUROFISC is working full five for e-commerce, and only one feedback concerning this four hundred and eighty.
So, the member state did not find this information very useful, they don't know why they have been selected only five member states, put the seniors into the database.
And the others, they did not read it because they did not find the information very useful.
So, there are also some signal formation concerning fraud trends or topic, three or four topics a change they found that useful.
And then there is changing web crawling tools, but this is something that some members take on legally use in their countries.
Other member states, they are prevented by the internal legislation to use the web crawling tools.
So, now the working file is frozen and the activities frozen is not useful.
They are waiting for the proposal of the on the chain of information between payment service provider.
Because they will, they will be a database and they will have access.
That's the proposal of the commission, to all the information supplied by the payment service provider by any other countries does the proposal of the commission.
We, of course, support very much and we place the proposal in the report, but I didn't know that even the commission needs some support on that proposal, because now I realize I asked yesterday <CENSORED> and <CENSORED> said that there are problems in the council.
But I gave, I gave for granted because this proposal come from some discussion in some fora with member states, and with stakeholder on.
Hopefully, this is very important, because the there is another problem is lack of controls and audit to MOS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here, they are nobodies why, because that's never how can i if not i don't know it i don't have data region analysis.
So, my audit will be randomly selection with maybe a lot of inform and no records so they need some data and this the data.
There will be many more application the company in addition to doing.
Yeah, it appear about Germany, these understand it because we have the data.
Non-US team, but the information may he have available.
A phenomenon.
But, I don't know further there is no practically no control.
Also the inspections of knowledge on distance intra-EU distances were not very successful.
Therefore the customs, we have the results of the sample by courier from the and the postal abuses.
In the post office the main problems to tackle the the question of undervaluation you have drones very expensive drones declared below ten units or to twenty two euros.
Sample like these are thousand as so simple.
And they can read and it's very difficult to handle that at the level of a post office.
And for the courier they are abusing the the custom relief of one hundred and fifty, because they just tick on the box for the assumption and then the fifty is not able to close.
The declaration to stop the declaration, even though devaluation higher than one hundred and fifty we check that, not only in the sample, also in the directly in the custom electronic system in the dam environment where we made some trials on.
Member states it didn't working in any member state only in austria it work it.
But in Austria it did not receive.
We put on another declaration for alcohol.
And then for alcohol it was asserted and because this categorization a applicable to alcoholic products.
So, there are also some failures in the Austrian system.
So, this and the problem is the authorised economic operator the most reliable custom traders are abusing the system.
Then, we have the recommendation the recommendation on the for the commission is that it makes use of the structures provided in the treaties of mutual assistance with non-eu countries.
To tackle the issues, to tackle the issues identify a lack of replies.
Also to carry out the inspection of member state controls on, the locally concerning relief.
Monitor the functioning of the intra-EU distance sales a minimum, stop shop this recommendation is the only that the commission has not accepted it.
This why yesterday was laughing because you're on task.
Is the commission monitoring and <CENSORED 22:25> said: "yes yes yes".
I was laughing, but, ok.
They assist member state to develop a methodology to produce the estimates of the compliance VAT gap on newcomers.
Because this is the problem we've cannot know whether the system is working or not.
The most system is assumed to be successful, but is usually an assumption and that's we have an estimate on the most VAT gap.
We don't know whether the system is successful and for the intra-EU itself, we don't have also any any estimate so it would be very important.
That the commission assist member states developing, this is a calculation of the VAT gap.
Also, very important to explore the use of alternative technology solu solutions.
To tackle VAT fraud, maybe there could be assisting alternative system of split payments.
Using blockchain technology there are proposed paths, the KPMG KPMG and also proposal of professor E. Ensworth.
There very interesting proposals of course we have discussed with the commission the commission say that they are theoretical in practical way they come to solutions.
Didn't find any practical application in reality, also professor Lamas has made some proposals of using technology for the imports from the non-EU countries.
But are this this system accepted by many by other countries.
There are no practical experience, but I think we think that is worth it too to go deeper blockchain technology of offers opportunities.
This is something that is being explored also by the commission to manage the database of the i important stop shops.
Numbers to manage the validity of this i ioss numbers.
It's very important he which this is the future this is, the only way to tackle fraud with using the new technologies name for member states.
We like of course that they are start reacting to the fraud seniors, refacing EUROFISC.
Also monitor the trade-off compliant with the new threshold of ten thousand euros.
This is something that was highlighted by the Czech colleagues in their report.
And we took on board, also for the reason that they explained before.
To have a separate MOS and distances coordination function in the fellows, also to ensure that trader can only introduce the VAT rate, correct VAT rate in the MOS VAT returns.
Because if the trader introduces a wrong VAT rate, he receives only an advice, but the declaration can be sent anyway so it received an alert but it will be sent anyway.
Also perform the necessary checks upon receipt of the application for registration in the MOS to avoid this problem of double registrations.
Increase the audit activity in the MOS traders and distance sellers using administrative cooperation tools.
An employee of the periodic estimates on the compliance VAT upon e-commerce.
So if for this recommendation to member states, we would be very grateful if you could remember in your home countries about importance to follow our recommendations.
This is why we seek your cooperation in this matter, and that's all we know if you have any questions.
Mister Mayrbeurle, the floor is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for the invitation.
It is an honour for me to be here to speak to you.
And my topic is to give you a brief overview about our big data tool we use in the Austrian Court of Audit since three years now.
So before I really start I want to give you an overview of the biggest Austrian municipalities.
You can see the municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants and since two thousand and eleven we are entitled to audit all these local governments.
The limit before was twenty thousand.
So the grey points are over twenty thousand inhabitants and the blue ones are under twenty thousand.
The explanations is still in German.
Sorry for that.
So in total we are entitled to audit seventy five municipalities.
This is about three point two percent of the total amount.
But we are counseling all Austrian communities.
And for that reason we decided in our department to develop a special tool, which we call the Municipality Monitoring Tool.
And the development team consists of three young economists in our department and I am one of those.
And we all three use the tool for different purposes.
So what was the goal, what was the aim for the  em reason for designing this tool?
The main reason was to to find an analysis tool for the financial risk assessment.
So we are trying firstly to prepare a profile for each municipality.
With to consideration of all relevant factors.
In the second step we assess the municipalities with regard to their significance for the audit activisties of the Austrian current Austrian Court of Audit.
And finally we rank the municipalities according to the financial risk on the basis of certain indicators.
The ranking is always the interesting part, the most interesting part of the whole story, because we can compare any municipalities.
Thank you.
So the biggest challenge of every database project is to collect data with quality.
We heard it the day before.
In this context we are happy to to use the data of the Statistics of Austria which is the Austrian statistics agency and this agency is our most important partner in this project.
And we get the following data ehm.
Actually this data is open for every citizen.
But you have to buy it from the Statistics of Austria if you want the aggregated data.
And only the aggregated data is useful for analysis.
So we have the gross cutting accounts of the budgeting and accounts regulations.
We have detailed info infomo information of the closed accounts so we have the accounts on its free ticket level.
And we have statements of debts and liabilities.
So, mainly we use finance and accounting data but of course we have sss separately we have data, numbers of population and other data which come from the Statistics of Austria s.
What we we have the data from the period now from two thousand eight to two thousand and thirteen.
Ah that is a mistake, I am sorry about it.
And we constantly updating this data every autumn.
As we have the data from the accounting systems of the municipalities, we we have no data about the municipality contributions, we have no data about the lease obligations and we have no data of the balances and assets because the municipalities do not publish this data.
This is an important point because em in in practice when you go to the municipality and you have the official accountant, you find the debt number and if you go to the em to the corporation to the municipality contributions it may happen tha it may happen that you find this debt number once again so it will be double and you only have half of the story if you only check the em the accounts of the accounts of the municipality itself.
So, from the existing data we think that our sell well indicators, which I will explain later, and we try to make a indicator model and this monitoring is based on a model which is comprised of indicators that are compiled as assessment indicators, broken down with themes.
And from these a statistic is derived between one and hundred that is closest to relevance for audit.
So this model enables a rating of the indicators according to specific issues.
And in order to set the relevance for audit, the Austrian Court of Audit uses the indicators for the financial situation as the basic setting but depending on the issue raised, depending on the issue on to audit you can choose another indicator setting.
And you have a different result.
So the indicator model consists of four topics and the first one is the financial situation in the long-term.
That means we we take the net debts, plus the liabilities minus security holdings and minus reserves.
So the first one gives us the long-term perspective, that means debt minus assets.
And the second one gives us the short-term perspective.
Which is..yes please.
For a short-term we define the core balance, which is the current revenues without transfers minus current expenditures without transfers and pensions.
That is an important point of the indicator model because we we are not using em key figures which I expressed em per capita.
We are using a different key figure and this is the own earnings as a relevant figure because its better to to to show the economic power of the municipalitity.
So the next one is the admisni administrative structure.
Where we simply put together the administrative expenses and personnel expenses.
Last one was the biggest challenge for us.
We tried to to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And yes we take into account other accounts, the miscellaneous accounts, the representation expenses and the analysis of special accounts.
That means we are trying to find book keeping errors with this data.
So this slide is a screen shot of one possible output of the monitoring tool.
And you can see the municipalities which are listed em end from from the best municipality down to the worst.
So the black column gives us the value and it is with regard to the significance of the audit activities for the Austrian Court of Audit and for that in this picture it is ranked for for a relevance of audit for our department.
So the four columns on the right gives us the indicators.
The indicators of the model I explained before.
And the black column gives us the value three point thirty three which is take municipality Hallwang, which is a small municel municipality near to Salzburg and this one is the best municipality.
That means it is a benchmark.
So if you want to audit the municipality with the best financial sit in the best financial situation, we audit Hallwang.
If you want to audit the worst one, we just skip the picture and take the last one but I don't want to show you this municipalities today.
And we have all municipalities of Austria in our system but not every municipality is in our em is in our duty, in our assessment duty so only the second one yes the second one is is is possible to audit for us.
And we try to compare the municipalities with the class of municipalities with the same size, so we are not comparing Vienna to Hallwang, so we are trying to find similar municipalities so em so  it will be a fair compare, comparision.
So we have many different output possibilities of this tool and another feature is this output journal for every single municipality.
Here for example we have the municipality Hallwang.
We can do thi th th this journal for every municipality of Austria and you as you can see you I think you will not be able to read it but it gives us a lot if indik key figures, indicators, graphs and  em of the financial situation and development.
Another output of the journal is em these two pages, for example you can see the analysis of the personal expenses em on the left side, this is the red line of the graph.
And in comparison to the the other municipalities you can choose the blue line and where the red line exceeds the blue line, the municipality is worse.
Or
So you can easily assess if the municipality has excessive expenditures.
So and on the right side we have the transfers that means we have the outgoing and the incoming money in a perspective of the municipality.
But these two outputs are only two of many.
We are now using a some statistical programs like R Stat Plus and we are able to do any analysis em which is em em necessary em, which is asked by our em our bosses.
So, as you can see we we use this tool for the audit planning, for the preparation, for the operational level and upon request, that means when somebody is going to municipality just for a presentation, you can use the journal.
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in a region, we can do it, and this information helps us not only in the in the audit itself.
And in line with our advisory approach we provide the specific fact shets fact sheets to the municipality.
That means if the if the mayor calls us and wants to know about his municipality and how their financial situation is in the in this municipality, we can give them a fact sheets and the journal.
So thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
<CENSORED> you are on-line, can you hear us?
Do you want me to start?
Yes.
Ok, ha ha ha, sorry.
First of all, thank you for inviting me to speak at your e-data conference.
With an access to government information it is a fundamental democratic right.
And that role requires the government to share public information.
A society changed a great deal since an act came into force.
And information is no longer kept on paper but in dynamic computer systems.
And at the meantime virtually everyone is connected through a series of devices to the internet.
And twenty first century government can respond to these challenges by giving the public direct access to government information.
In another words, the government could publish open data actively.
Then the volume of open data cannot be seen separately from the move towards digital government.
And here the United Kingdom and the United States are setting the pace.
They see open data, em are clearly not a goal but a means to become transparent.
And they are leading in the w the world in the open government partnership...
An ini initiative to encourage government to be as open as possible.
And in Europe there are several european directives and treaties which are important for open data legislation and policies.
And the Dutch government has open data ambitions and policies.
But the actual implementation is still grass roots and its in early stages.
The Netherlands Court of Audit and its former President, Mrs. Stuiveling, see the great potential in open data.
And in 2013, we decided to monitor the progress of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report we concentrated on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We did a survey on the commitment of the ministries to open data.
Our approach is positive, because we concentrated on ministries which were doing well and we tried to encourage the ministries who fell behind.
And through sessions with open data experts and civil servants, and publications of factsheets with good examples national and international.
In second report we emphasised the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We've in identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers opportunities to the government.
And by opening em e data on its expenditure and performance, the government will have better understanding of its own funding.
This way it turn how the parliament scrutinise the government.
For citizens the open data sets would make the government more transparent and accessible.
From a business view, innovative entrepreneurs can turn open data into new applications.
One of our objectives was what the Netherlands could learn from the United Kingdom and the United States.
Using data for the open data bio meter made by World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of open data.
The awareness to secure positive outcomes from open government data initiatives.
The extent to which open data are available.
And the impact on society, business and government.
ehm society, business and government
And if we compared I am sorry.
Sorry.
I am getting am getting em my voice feeding back into the monitor.
It is very distractive.
OK.
But continue.
If we compare the United Kingdom and United States with the Netherlands...
We can see that the United Kingdom and United States come better on implementation and impact.
There is little difference regarding the readiness for open data.
If we look at readiness, the Netherlands score less well.
Only with regards to the right for information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
Regarding availability, United Kingdom and United States publish far more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data sets in the United States is enormous.
The type of data the countries release differs on the number of points.
The Netherlands currently publish publishes little open data on government spending and public contracting.
And the Dutch Trade Register is not open either.
As you can see the u United Kingdom has open data on all policy fields.
The impact of open data can be broken down into political, social and economic dimensions.
And the Netherlands lag behind United Kingdom and United States on the shows social and economic dimensions.
This means that the Netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in making and scrutinising government policy.
Businesses generate little added value with open data.
In both our reports we've added international examples which can serve as a good example for the Netherlands.
And in Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed charts on waiting times for hospitals.
We did not re rely on open data barometers only.
And we did our own research as well.
And to get a better picture of the volume and type of open data currently available
we looked at the data that are published on our national open data portal.
In total there is a three thousand two hundreds data sets were available in February February two thousand and fifteen.
And slightly more than half of the data sets are provided by central government.
The greater part of the open data published by central government is produced by the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And the ministry's public work public work dimension is by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands.
For our two reports we asked all ministries what actions they are taking to publish open data.
And the score we awarded to each ministry, was based on six indicators.
Such as support from the top of the ministry and person's of an action plan.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries took exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and how much funding they have provided in two thousand and fou fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Security and Justice had spent no time or money on publication of public data.
But other ministries have tasked several people with publishing open data and have released a budget for activities.
And the conclusions of two thousand and thirteen ff fourteen; we concluded that the open data are a standard but not yet practice.
And the open data that have been enacted there has been a concerned chiefly with the government what government knows rather than what a government does.
We also got a couple of comments and em a they rely on the ehm the success of open data policy.
And the government should ehm give a greater inside into what data are available.
They should create right conditions, right conditions for open data.
And the third one was that the government must invest in both; the supply and the demand sides of open data.
For example by founding an open data institute.
For our two thousand and fifteen report we found that the government and ministries had taken steps to make open data more widely accepted.
And partly in response to our first open data turned report, the Ministry of Interior is cur currently coordinating a government wide data set analysis.
The Netherlands is thus following the good examples set by the United Kingdom and United States.
There was a downside.
We also found that the open data provided through the national portal was one sided.
Virtual virtually all the open data sets are geo data, geographical data, and almost all of them are published by one ministry.
Very few data are important, that are important for a public control of government finances and government activities are available.
Most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into consideration for the development of the Dutch open data policy.
Thus Dutch government should define goals and milestones in a concrete action plan.
And we also think that the opening of data should be mandatory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
On which em will be determined what data are the grow greatest social importance and what data should in any event be open data.
And the government should use open data themselves for example in the social domain decentralisations.
This is a big nationwide programme in the Netherlands, where responsibility is being transferred from the cetr central government to to municipalities.
Our em our reports had a positive impact.
The Ministry of Interior will publish results of a government wide data sets data survey this month.
And the House of Representatives accepted the Motion for a national information infrastructure.
And based on the data inventory, the Ministry of Interior will set up a national open data agenda.
And in that agenda they will publish what data wi em will be open and when they will open it.
Ehm we also try to lead by the example ehm
And we published our own expenditure on the on our website so that everyone can see what the Netherlands Court of Audit spends its mone spends its money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open spending.
And the Ministry of Finance now has planned to open up detailed expenditure data for the government next year.
OK.
As you have seen the open data movement in the Netherlandsis maturing and the Netherlands Court of Audit will continue to follow the progress.
Thank you for your attention.
And if you are interested you can find our reports in English and our spending data in Dutch on our website.
so we have the question devon is going to make 3 shelves for
her father
she has a piece of lumber that is 12 feet long
she wants the top shelf to be half a foot shorter than the
middle shelf
so let me do this in different colors
she wants the top shelf to be half a foot shorter than the
middle shelf
so ill just lets just read the whole thing first and the
bottom shelf to be half a foot shorter than twice the length
of the top shelf
let me do that in a different color
ill do that in blue
the bottom shelf to be half a foot shorter than twice the
length of the top shelf
how long will each shelf be if she uses the
entire 12 feet of wood
so lets define some variables for our different shelves
because thats what we have to figure out
we have the top shelf the middle shelf
and the bottom shelf
so lets say that t is equal to length of top shelf t for
top of top shelf
lets make m equal the length of the middle shelf
m for middle
and then lets make b equal to the length of the bottom
shelf b for bottom bottom shelf
so lets see what these different statements tell us
so this first statement she says she wants the top shelf
and ill do it in that same color she wants the top
shelf to be 12 a foot shorter than the middle shelf
so she wants the length of the top shelf to be so this is
equal to 12 a foot shorter than the middle shelf
so if were doing everything in feet its going to be the
length of the middle shelf in feet minus
12 minus 12 feet
so thats what that sentence in orange is telling us
the top shelf needs to be 12 a foot shorter than the length
of the middle shelf
now what does the next statement tell us
and the bottom shelf to be so the bottom shelf needs to
be equal to 12 a foot shorter than so its 12 a foot
shorter than twice the length of the top shelf
so its 12 a foot shorter than twice the
length of the top shelf
these are the two statements interpreted in
equal equation form
the top shelfs length has to be equal to the middle shelfs
length minus 12
its 12 foot shorter than the middle shelf
and the bottom shelf needs to be 12 a foot shorter than
twice the length of the top shelf
and so how do we solve this
well you cant just solve it just with these two
constraints but they gave us more information
they tell us how long will each shelf be if she uses the
entire 12 feet of wood
so the length of all of the shelves have to
add up to 12 feet
shes using all of it
so t plus m plus b needs to be equal to 12 feet
thats the length of each of them
shes using all 12 feet of the wood
so the lengths have to add to 12
so what can we do here
well we can get everything here in terms of one variable
maybe well do it in terms of m and then substitute
so we already have t in terms of m
we could everywhere we see a t we could substitute
with m minus 12
but here we have b in terms of t
so how can we put this in terms of m
well we know that t is equal to m minus 12
so lets take everywhere we see a t lets substitute it
with this thing right here
that is what t is equal to
so we can rewrite this blue equation as the length of the
bottom shelf is 2 times the length of the top shelf t
but we know that t is equal to m minus 12
and if we wanted to simplify that a little bit this would
be that the bottom shelf is equal to lets distribute
the 2 2 times m is 2m
2 times negative 12 is negative 1
and then minus another 12
or we could rewrite this as b is equal to 2 times the middle
shelf minus 32
right
12 is 22 minus another 12 is negative
32 just like that
so now we have everything in terms of m and we can
substitute back here
so the top shelf instead of putting a t there we could
put m minus 12
so we put m minus 12 plus the length of the middle
shelf plus the length of the bottom shelf
well we already put that in terms of m
thats what we just did
this is the length of the bottom shelf in terms of m
so instead of writing b there we could write 2m minus 32
plus 2m minus 32 and that is equal to 12
all we did is substitute for t
we wrote t in terms of m and we wrote b in terms of m
now lets combine the m terms and the constant terms so if
we have we have one m here we have another m there and
then we have a 2m there
theyre all positive
so 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4m
so we have 4m
and then what do our constant terms tell us
we have a negative 12 and then we have a negative 32
so negative 12 minus 32 that is negative 42 or
negative 2
so we have 4m minus 2
and of course we still have that equals 12
now we want to isolate just the m variable on one side of
the equation
so lets add 2 to both sides to get rid of this 2 on the
lefthand side
so if we add 2 to both sides of this equation the
lefthand side were just left with 4m these guys
cancel out is equal to 14
now divide both sides by 4 we get m is equal to 14 over
4 or we could call that 72 feet because were doing
everything in feet
so we solved for m but now we still have to
solve for t and b
so lets do that
lets solve for t
t is equal to m minus 12
so its equal to our m is 72 minus 12 which is equal
to 62 or 3 feet
everything is in feet so thats how we
know its feet there
so thats the top shelf is 3 feet
the middle shelf is 72 feet which is the same thing as 3
and 12 feet
and then the bottom shelf is 2 times the top
shelf minus 12
so whats that going to be equal to
thats going to be equal to 2 times 3 feet thats what the
length of the top shelf is minus 12 which is equal to 6
minus 12 or 5 and 12 feet
and were done
and you can verify that these definitely do add up to 12
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 feet and it
meets all of the other constraints
the top shelf is 12 a foot shorter than the middle shelf
and the bottom shelf is 12 a foot shorter than 2
times the top shelf
and we are done
we know the lengths of the shelves that
devon needs to make
fill in the table with whole numbers
to write 430 in five different ways
so lets think about this a little bit
we could literally view this 4 as 4 hundreds
so its 4 hundreds
and the 3 is in the tens place so its 3 tens
so this is 4 hundreds and 3 tens
but we could rearrange things a little bit
for example we might only have 3 hundreds
so we took a hundred from the hundreds place
and we could give it to the tens place
so if you take that hundred and give it to the tens place
a hundred is 10 tens
so youve got 10 tens and then you already had 3 tens
so youre going to have 13 tens right over here
now this seems a little confusing
remember this is 430
this is 300 plus 130
thats still 430
likewise you could view this as 200 plus 230
230 is the same thing as 23 tens
same way you could view this as 100 plus 330
33 tens is 330
and finally you could view it as 0 hundreds and 43 tens
43 tens is 430
 welcome lets talk about the web
the thing that youre using right now
the web is this fast network of connected computers
and as of 2014 there are literally more than
a billion websites a billion
when i was a kid we only had one million
and we thought we were cool
what do we use websites for
well in the beginning researchers used websites to share
their research like on highenergy particle colliders
but now everybody uses it for pretty much everything
maybe you use a social network to chat with your family
a photo website for sharing photos
of your adorable kitty cats
a travel website to decide where to go on an exotic trip
or a news website to figure out
whats going on in the world
and of course you must be using
the khan academy website to learn
so whats your favorite website
actually i have a better question
what website do you wish existed but doesnt yet
maybe a website about yourself
or about something that you love
the cool thing is you can program a website yourself
and you can learn how to do it here on khan academy
start brainstorming what you want to make
because youll be able to do it soon enough
first lets back up a bit and clear up some terminology
what is the web exactly
well like i said its a bunch of
connected computers that have websites
when a computer is connected to the web
and spitting out a website we call that computer a server
because its serving the website
a website is written using three languages
html for marking up the website content
css for styling it
and javascript for making it interactive
how do users like you actually see those websites
well you use an app dedicated for website browsing
like chrome firefox or internet explorer
and we call those apps browsers
browsers try to all show the same website the same way
but they do have their differences which is why
we sometimes say oops theres a bug in that browser
try another one
which browser are you using right now
well you must be using that browser
from some sort of device like a laptop
phone tablet or even a smart tv
and we call those devices clients
clients can be really different
some are way smaller than others
some have touchscreens others have keyboards
some are black and white
so websites have to try to work well
in all sorts of clients
what client are you using right now
and thats the web
well the twominute version
theres lots more to learn about the web
but now i think its about time to start having you write
some html and css to make your own web pages
show 109 by shading
so just as a bit of review 109 if we were to write it
out would literally be 109 percent which is the same
thing as 109 per and i could write cent again but thats
getting old
cent means 100 so it literally
means 109 per hundred
if you had 100 per 100 youre dealing with the whole but
now we have more than a whole
we have 109 per 100
we can actually write this as a ratio or as a fraction
this is the same thing as 109 per 100
its the the same thing as 109100
so lets shade that in
so we have a whole here so we could consider
this square a whole
in the last video we counted
this is a 10 by 10 square
it is cut up into 100 pieces
so if we want 109 of those 100 pieces what
are we talking about
that means were going to shade in all of the
100 right over here
let me do that in a new color
so well shade in all of this
if you just shaded that in that would be 100
that would be 100100 or 100 per 100 or 100
i think youre getting the meaning of all of this
i dont just want you just memorize this stuff
this really just means 100 out of 100 or a whole
and you can see that this is the whole square
thats 100 out of 100 right there
the question is saying show us 109 by shading
we already did 100 per 100 but we need to do another 9
so lets shade in another 9
so now we have one two three four five six seven
eight nine
so this piece right here you could almost view that is
well that is
that is 9 of an entire square
this is 100 of an entire square
if you considered this whole thing plus this blue area
right over here you are talking about 109 of one
whole square
hopefully that made sense
Lets get started with some problems
lets see
first problem what is
what is 15 percent of 40
the way i do percent problems is i just convert the
percentage to a decimal and then i multiply it times the
the number that i m trying to get the percentage of
so 15 percent as a decimal is point 1 5
you learned that from the for the um percent to decimal conversion
a video hopefully
and we just multiply this times 40 
so lets say 40 times fifth point 1 5
5 times 0 is 0
5 times 4 is 20
bring down
put a 0 there
and then 1 times 0 is 0
1 times 4 is 4
and you get 6 0 0
then you count the decimal spots
1 2
no decimals up there so you go 1 2 and 
you put the decimal there
so 15 percent of 40 is equal to point 1 5 times 40 which equals 6 point 0 0
well thats just the same thing as 6 
lets do another problem
hopefully that didnt confuse you too much
and im going to try to confuse you this time just
in case you werent properly confused the last time
what is point 2 percent of mmm let me think of a number of seven
so a lot of peoples inclinationt would just 
say oh point 2 percent thats the same thing as point 2
and if that was your inclination you would be wrong
cos remember this isnt point 2
this is point 2 percent
so there is 2 ways of thinking about this
you could say that this is point 2 over a 100 which is if you
multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 is the
same thing as 2 over a 1000
or you can just do the technique where you 
move the decimal space over 2 to the left
in which case if youre starting with point 2 you move
the decimal space 2 to the left you go bam
whoops
bam bam
thats where the decimal goes
thats point 0 0 2
this is key
point 2 percent is the same thing as point 0 0 2
this can always trip you up and ive ive made this careless mistake
all the time so dont feel bad if you ever do it
but just always pay carefull attention to your decimal
and a percentage at the same time
so now that weve figured out how to write this percentage
as the decimal we just have to multiply it times the number
that we want take the percentage of
so we say point 0 0 2 times 7 
well this is pretty straightforward
7 times 2 is 14 right
and how many totals numbers do we have or how many total
digits do we have behind the decimal point
lets see
its 1 2 3
so we need 1 2 3 digits behind the decimal point
so point 2 percent of 7 is equal to point zero 1 4
and youre probably thinking boy thats a really
really small number
and and it it makes sense because point 2 percent thats y if you 
if you wanna think about it thats smaller than even 1 percent
so thats even smaller than 1 100th
and actually if you think about it point 2 percent is 1 500th
so and if you do the math 7 1 500th of 7
will turn out to be this number
and thats thats an important thing to do
is always good to do a reality check because when
youre going this decimal or these ehm um percent problems
its very easy to uhm kind of lose a factor of 10 here or there
or gain the factor of 10
so always do a reality check to see if your answer makes sense
so now im gonna confuse you even further
what if i were to ask you 4 is 20 percent of what number
what number
so lot of peoples reflex would might just be
oh let me take 20 percent
it becomes point 2 0
and mutiply it times 4
and in that case again you you may be wrong
cos think about it
im not saying what is 20 percent of 4
im saying that 20 percent of some number is 4
so now were gonna be doing a little bit of algebra
i bet you didnt expect that in the percent module
so let x equal the number
the number
or this number
let x equal that number
and this problem says that 20 percent 20 percent of x is equal to 4
i think now its in a form that you might recognise
so how do you write 20 percent of it as a decimal
well thats just point 2 0 or point 2
and we just multiply it by x to get four
so 20 percent thats the same thing as point 2
its the same thing as point 2 0 but that last trailing 
zero doesnt mean much
point 2 times x is equal to 4
and now we have a level 1 linear equation
i bet you didnt expect to see that
so what do we do
we we can either
oh well there is two ways to view it
you can just divide the both sides of this equation
by the coefficient on x
so if you do divide point 2 here you divide by point 2 here
so you get x is equal to 4 divided by point 2
so lets figure out what 4 divided by point 2 is
see i hope i have enough space
point 2 goes into 4 im gonna put a decimal point here
and the way we do these problems we move the
decimal point here 1 over to the right
we just get a 2 and we can move the decimal point
1 over to the right
so this point 2 goes into 4 the same number of times
that 2 goes into 40
and this is easy
2 goes into 40 how many times
well 2 goes into 4 2 times and then 2 goes 
to 0 0 times
you couldve done that in your head
2 into 40 is 20 times
so 4 divided by point 2 is 20
so the answer is 4 is 20 percent of 20
and does that make sense
well theres a couple ways to think about it
20 percent is roughly what
it it is exactly a one 5th
and right 4 times 5 is 20 
that makes sense
if youre still not sure we can check the problem
lets take 20 percent of 20
so 20 percent of 20 is equal to point 2 times 20
and if you do the maths that also will equal 4
so you made sure you got the right answer
lets do another one like that
eehmm im picking numbers randomly
lets say 3 is mmm hm 9 percent of what
so if x 
once again
lets let x equal the number
the number that 3 is 9 percent of
you dont have to write all that
well in that case we know that point 0 9 x
right point 0 9 thats the same 
thing as 9 percent of x is equal to 3
or that x is equal to 3 divided by point 0 9
well if we do the decimal division point 0 9 goes into 3
lets put a decimal point here
i dont know how many 0s im going to need
so if i move this decimal over to the right twice then ill
move this decimal over to the right twice
so point 0 9 goes into 3 the same number of times
that 9 goes into 300
so 9 goes into 30 three times
3 times 9 is 27
i think i see a pattern here already
30 3 3 times 9 is 27 
youre just gonna keep getting 33 3 3 3 the 3s are just
gonna go on forever
so turns out that 3 is 9 percent of you can either write it as 
33 point 3 repeating or we all know that point 3 forever is the
same thing as one third
so 3 is 9 percent of 33 and one third
either one of those would be an acceptable answer
a lot times when youre doing percentages youre
actually just trying to get a ballpark
so ahm the precision might not always be the most important thing
but in this case we will be precise
and obviously on tests and things you need to
be precise as well
hopefully i didnt go too fast and you have a good 
sense of percentage
the important thing for these type of problems is pay
attention to how the problem is written 
if it says find you know 10 percent of a hundred
thats easy
you just te convert 10 percent to the decimal multiply by 100
but if i were to ask you a 100 is 10 percent of what
you have to remember that thats a different problem
in which case a 100 is 10 percent of and if you did the math
it would be a 1000
i think i spoke very quickly on this problem on this ehhm on this module
so i hope you didnt get too confused
but i will record more
you might have heard the term libor when people are quoting interest rates
or theyre saying hey im gonna lend you money a few percentage points above libor
you will hearlibor quoted on some of the financial news channels
and what it is is just an average of the interest rates that banks are lending to each other
and it is calculated by the british bank association
its actually calcuated by thomson reuters for the british bank association
but its there to kind of provide a benchmark for other types of securities and financial transactions
and it literally stands for the london interbank offered rate
soits the in londonits the ratethe offered rate between banks
the london interbank offered rate
to understand that a little bit better we have set up two banks over here
bank a and bank b and you might have already known that
when you go and deposit your money in banks
the bank wont leave all that money around
the way it makes money is lend a good bit of money to other people as loans
and it keeps just enough cash on hand
that things well you know people would actually come and ask for money from their checking account
we have enough on hand
you could imagineevery now and then that bank might get low on cash
or it might get close to kind of a reserve requirement
that the central bank in that country requires a bank to have on it
so in those situations say bank a is getting to thatthat situation
they said let me go borrow some money
let me go borrow money from another bank
so this is interbank borrowing
bank b over here they are flushed with cash
so they say we dont like to keep so much cash around
we want to lend it so we can actually get interest we get no interest on cash
so maybe bank b lends money to bank a
so maybe they lend this much cash
so thats the new cash that bank a got
right over there the new cash
and of course it is a loan
so this is a new loan to offset it remember
assets are equal to liabilities plus equity
so liabilities is this whole thing over here
so this is loan from b for this cash
they have a little bit better of a cushion
and now b their loan has increased and their cash has decreased
so this is a loan loan to a
right now they took this cash and they gave to bank a
and that rate that they lent it at
maybe it was that 1 annual rate
and of course it is to be renewed everyday it is overnight rate
this rate is an interbank rate
so what they do is on behalf of the british bank association
they go survey a bunch of banks in london
eight twelve sixteen banks in london
so they said hey what was the rate in which you all transacted
and they will quote that
they quote that as the overnight libor
so they quoted it say hey 12 across all of the banks that we surveyed
but whats interesting about the libor it is done in ten currencies
it is not just in the sterling the dollar
or the yenit is in ten currencies
thats what really differentiate it amongst other things
but really differentiate it from the effective federal funds rate which is another interbank borrowing rate
but thats in the united states
and thats more revolving around policy concerns
the federal bank actually tries to change it
