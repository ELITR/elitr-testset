I now give the floor to Mr Mayrbeurle.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
It is a great honour for me that they can speak here.
I will try to brief you here on our large data tool, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
So before I begin in earnest, I would like to inform you about the situation in Austria's largest municipalities.
These are municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants, and from the year two thousand and eleven we have the right to control all these local governments.
Before that, the threshold was 20,000.
Grey points therefore represent more than twenty thousand inhabitants and blue less than twenty thousand.
The explanation is still in German.
Sorry about that.
In total, we are authorized to audit seventy-five municipalities.
This represents about 3.2 percent of the total number of municipalities
However, we provide advice to all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, we have decided to develop a special tool in our department, which we call the Municipal Monitoring Tool.
The development team consists of three young economists who work in our department.
All three of us use this tool for different purposes.
So what was the objective of this instrument, why was this instrument created in the first place?
The main reason was to try to find an analytical tool for assessing financial risk.
So first we try to design a profile for each municipality.
Having regard to all relevant factors.
In the second step, we assess the municipalities with regard to their importance for the audit activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we rank municipalities according to financial risk based on certain indicators.
The order is always interesting, it's the most interesting thing about all this because it gives us the opportunity to compare all the municipalities.
Thank you.
So the hardest task for any database project is to collect quality data.
We heard about it a day earlier.
In this context, we must mention that we are greatly assisted by the Statistics of Austria, which is an Austrian statistical agency, and this agency is our most important partner in this project.
We obtained the following data from them.
This data is actually available to every citizen.
However, if you want aggregated data, you have to buy it from Statistics Austria.
And only aggregated data is useful for analysis.
So we have cross-cutting accounts of budgets and accounting regulations.
We have detailed information about closed accounts, so we have accounts at the free-ticket level.
And then we have debt and liability statements.
So we mainly use financial and accounting data, but of course we have separately population data and other data that comes from Statistics Austria.
Now we have data from this period from year two thousand eight to year two thousand thirteen.
And that's a mistake, for which I apologize.
We constantly update this data, every autumn.
Because we have data from municipal accounting systems, we have no data on municipal contributions, we have no data on rental obligations, nor do we have any data on balances and assets, because municipalities do not publish these data.
That's important because in practice you have some official accountant in the community, you find out some amount of debt and if you look at the companies' contributions to the community, you might find that value of debt here again, so it's going to be a duplication and if you're just checking the accounts of the community itself, you only have half.
So from the existing data, we think our indicators are good, which I will explain later, and we will try to create an indicator model and this monitoring is based on a model that consists of indicators that are compiled as scoreboards broken down by topic.
From this, statistics from one to 100 are derived, which is most relevant for the audit.
This model therefore allows the assessment of indicators by specific topics.
And in order to determine the relevance for the audit, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses financial situation indicators as the basic setting, but depending on the issue raised, depending on the audit theme, you can choose a different setting of indicators.
Then you get a different result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four themes, the first being the financial situation in the long term.
This means that we take net debt plus liabilities minus securities holdings and minus reserves.
So the first one gives us a long-term perspective, that's debt minus assets.
And the other one gives us a short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we define the basic balance, which is current income without transfers minus current expenditure without transfers and pensions.
This is an important point in the indicator model, because we are not using the key figures that I have expressed per capita.
We use a different figure as the relevant number, namely own revenues, because it is better to show the economic power of the municipality.
Next comes the administrative structure.
That's simply where we put together administrative expenses and personal expenses.
Personal data is the most challenging task for us.
We tried to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And, yes, we do take into account other accounts, various accounts, representation expenses and the analysis of separate accounts.
This means that we are trying to find accounting errors using this data.
So this image is a screenshot of one possible output of a monitoring tool
And you see the communities that are at the bottom of the list, from the best to the worst.
The black column therefore indicates the value and this is in view of the importance of audit activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors. In this figure, it is therefore assessed for the importance of audit for our department.
So, the four columns on the right are the indicators.
The model indicators I explained earlier.
The black column gives a value of three point thirty-three, which is the village of Halvank, a small village near Salzburg and it is the best municipality.
So this is kind of a benchmark.
So if you want to audit the municipality with the best financial location in the best financial situation, we will audit Halvanka.
If you would like to audit the worst municipalities, just skip the picture and go to the last one, but today I don't want to show you those municipalities.
We have all Austrian municipalities in our system, but not every municipality falls under our assessment obligation, so only the second, yes we can only audit the second.
We are trying to compare municipalities with the same class of municipalities of the same size, so we are not comparing Vienna with Halvanko. We are trying to find similar municipalities, so the comparison is fair.
So we have a lot of different output options for this tool, and another feature is this output diary for each individual municipality.
So we have the municipality of Halvank, for example.
We can make such a diary for every municipality in Austria and you will not be able to read it, as you can see, but it will give us a whole series of key figures, indicators, graphs and information about the financial situation and its development.
The next output of the journal is these two pages where, for example, you can see on the left the analysis of personal expenditure, it's the red line of the graph.
And when comparing to other municipalities, you can pick the blue line, and where the red line crosses the blue line, the municipality is worse.
Or
So you can easily assess whether a municipality is overspending.
And on the right-hand side, we have the transfers, which means that we have the outgoing and the incoming money from the community perspective.
But it is only two outcomes out of many.
We currently use some statistical programs, like R Stat Plus, and we can do whatever analysis is necessary - what our superiors want us to do.
As you can see, we use this tool for audit planning, for preparation, for operational matters and on-demand, which means that if someone wants to use this community just for presentation, they can use that journal.
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in the region, we can do that, and this information helps us not only in the audit itself.
And in accordance with our advisory approach, we provide municipalities with factual information.
This means that if a mayor calls us and wants to know about his community and what their financial situation is in this community, we can provide them with overviews and a diary.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
