<CENSORED>, do you copy?
Should I start?
Yes.
Yeah, ha ha ha, I'm sorry.
First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your conference on electronic data.
The right to access government information is a fundamental democratic right.
This requires the government to share public information.
Since the law came into force, society has changed a lot.
Information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
Over time, virtually all people started using the Internet, often on multiple devices.
The twenty-first century government can respond to these challenges by giving the public direct access to government information.
In other words, the government could actively publish open data.
In such a case, the volume of open data should be considered in the context of the digital governance transition.
Meanwhile, the UK, along with the US, is setting the pace in this area.
Open data is clearly viewed by these countries not as an objective, but as a means to achieve greater transparency.
From a global perspective, they are in a leading position with regard to an open government partnership.
This is an initiative to make the government as open as possible.
And there are several European directives and treaties in Europe that are important for open data legislation and policy.
The Dutch government, too, has considerable ambitions for open data and has adopted new rules.
But actual implementation is still in its infancy.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former chairwoman, Mrs Stuiveling, see great potential in open data.
In 2013, we decided to monitor the development of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We carried out a survey focused on the commitment of ministries to an open data policy.
Our approach is positive, because we have concentrated on ministries that have done well and, on the contrary, we have tried to encourage ministries that have fallen behind.
Through meetings with open data experts and civil servants and the publication of fact sheets with good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we stressed the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers opportunities for the government.
By starting to report openly on its spending and performance, the government will have a better idea of its own funding.
This will change the way Parliament supervises the government.
Open data sets would increase government transparency and accessibility for citizens.
From a business perspective, innovative entrepreneurs can transfer open data to new applications.
One of our goals was to find what the Netherlands could learn from Great Britain and the United States.
Using data for an open data biometer conducted by the World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of open data.
Awareness of securing positive results from government initiatives on open data.
The extent to which open data is available.
And the impact on society, the economy and the government.
um society, economy and government.
And if we compare ... excuse me
Sorry
My voice is kind of stuck on the monitor.
It disturbs me a lot.
All right.
We can continue.
If we compare Great Britain and the United States with the Netherlands,
the UK and the US are doing better with regard to implementation and impact.
There is little difference between them when it comes to their readiness for open data.
The Netherlands, on the other hand, is prepared significantly worse.
This concerns only the right to information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the United Kingdom and the United States publish much more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data files in the United States is huge.
The type of data countries publish varies by number of points.
The Netherlands currently publishes little open data on government spending and public procurement.
The Dutch Trade Register is not very open either.
As you can see, by contrast, the UK has open data in all areas.
The impact of open data has a political, social and economic dimension.
Socially and economically, the Netherlands lags behind both the UK and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in the creation and control of government policy.
The economic benefits of open data are very small.
In both our reports, we have set international examples that can set a good example for the Netherlands.
And in Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on hospital waiting times.
We didn't just rely on open data barometers
and we did our own research.
And to get a better idea of the currently available volume and type of open data
we looked at the data published on our national open data portal.
In total, three thousand two hundred data sets were available in February at two thousand and fifteen.
And slightly more than half of the data sets were provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by central government comes from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands is the ministry's public works.
In the case of our two reports, we asked all ministries what steps they were taking to publish open data.
The scores we gave each ministry were based on six indicators.
This included, for example, support from the Ministry's management and the Entity Action Plan.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have taken exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and what funds they provided in the year two thousand and fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice had neither the time nor the money to publish public data.
However, other ministries have mandated a few staff to publish open data and have freed up the budget for these activities.
Based on an examination of years two thousand and thirteen, we concluded that open data is the standard, but is not yet being applied in practice.
And given what was enacted in open data, it was mainly about the government, what the government knows rather than what the government does.
We also got some comments that rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should be better informed about what data is available.
They should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third was that the government must invest in both; on the supply and demand side of open data.
For example, by establishing an open data institute.
For our report for year two thousand and fifteen, we found that the government and ministries have taken steps to accept open data more widely.
And partly in response to our first report on open data, the Home Office is currently coordinating the entire government analysis of the data set.
The Netherlands is thus following the good examples set by the UK and the US.
There was a disadvantage.
We also found that the open data provided through the national portal was one-sided.
Virtually all open data files are geo data, geographic data, and almost all are published by one ministry.
Very little data is relevant to public control of government finances and government activity is available.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account for the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch government should therefore define targets and milestones in a specific action plan.
We also think that the opening of data should be mandatory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
This should determine which data is of the greatest social importance and which data should be made available in any case.
And the government should use open data itself, for example in the decentralisation of social networks.
In the Netherlands, this is a large nationwide programme where responsibility is transferred from central government to municipalities.
Our news has had a positive impact.
The Interior Ministry will release the results of a nationwide survey of data this month.
The House of Representatives has adopted a proposal for a national information infrastructure.
And based on the inventory of the data, the Department of the Interior will establish a national open data agenda.
It will publish in this agenda what data will be opened and when it will be opened.
We are trying to set an example.
We have posted our own expenses on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors is spending their money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open spending.
The Ministry of Finance now plans to make detailed spending data available to the government next year.
All right.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is progressing positively and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor developments,
Thank you for your attention.
If you are interested, you can find our reports on our website in English and our spending data in Dutch.
