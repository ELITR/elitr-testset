Hello, my name is <NAME> and I am the Managing Director of Smart Team from the Maria Teiulenu University of Economics in Pite»ôti, Romania.
The intention of our company is to provide agritourism services in tourist areas of Romania and to promote the tourist potential so that we are the market leader in this area.
After analysing the market for the 2019 winter season, we have created an offer for you that you will not be able to resist.
We called the package "Discover Dracula's Land."
It offers wonderful experiences in Bran, in Poiana Brasov, where Dracula was born.
We offer you three incredible days during which you can relax, have fun, visit the surroundings, take pictures and get memories of a lifetime.
The first day begins with a visit to the famous Castle of Bran, or "Castle of the Vampire Dracula," a place full of mysteries.
The next day you will enjoy visiting Dino Park with friends or family, the only dinosaur park in Romania and the largest such park in south-eastern Europe.
Another goal will be to discover one of nature's magnificent creations, the Seven Steps Canyon, which consists of seven waterfalls, the tallest of which measures thirty-five metres.
On the last day, you will have plenty of time to enjoy the 12 slopes, as we will provide you with a free daily pass.
And what better way to end your trip than with a special photography lesson in the Carpathians?
We hope we've piqued your curiosity to find out more about our offer and services, and we can't wait to meet you at our booth number fifty-eight.
