Hello.
Hi.
Oh, that's a very nice shirt.
What brand is that?
Oh, that's not a brand, that's my botel logo.
Really?
You have a botel?
Yes, of course.
Located on the Vltava River in the heart of České Budějovice, we offer three classes of rooms.
The first class is called Goldfish and includes the most luxurious room in our botel.
Then we have the second class, Silverfish, and the third class, which is called Bronze Fish.
I mean, do you offer any special rooms?
Yes, we do.
We have a special room designed for couples in love to celebrate anniversaries and the like.
I mean, do you have a restaurant...?
Yes, we do.
We have a restaurant for customers where the public can come, but our customers eat in it for free.
And if you stay in our restaurant longer than you wanted - well, you know, that can happen - then you can use our fitness centre with the latest equipment.
I mean, I'm sorry, but I don't like fitness, you don't offer, like, massages...?
Well, if fitness really doesn't appeal to you, then you can visit our relaxation centre where we offer massages, saunas, lava stone massages and more.
Well, well, well, I like that, great!
And if I may add, there's free wi-fi access and free guest parking throughout the botel.
Well, thank you.
I hope you'll visit us.
Absolutely.
