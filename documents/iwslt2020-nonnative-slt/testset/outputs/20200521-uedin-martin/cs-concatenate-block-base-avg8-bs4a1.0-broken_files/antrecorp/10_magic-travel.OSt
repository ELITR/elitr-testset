Hi!
Hi!
You work for a travel agency?
Because I saw your tag.
Yes, I work for a travel agency in Vienna called Magic Travel.
I'm planning on taking a trip with my girlfriend.
We offer romantic getaways, but if you're more of an adventurous couple, we also offer sports and culinary getaways.
We're more romantic.
We offer travel to Russia, Spain and England.
If you'd like to take a look at our catalogue...
Yes.
I mean, that's interesting.
Which would you recommend?
I would recommend Verona because it's a city of love, and I think your girlfriend would really like that.
If you have any further questions, I'll give you our business card, according to which you can contact us at any time.
But I have a confession to make, I don't have a girlfriend, and I'd like to go on a romantic journey with you.
I think we'll meet again in the office.
