Hi!
I'd like to introduce you to the company I represent.
Develop Most.
Our company was founded this year, but has already won several awards.
So there is a pretty great future ahead of us.
We offer cloud service and Minecraft.
Cloud service is primarily related to Office 365.
So the real supplier is Microsoft, we're just selling the license.
Specifically, we offer three licenses, for households, individuals, businesses and one large package under the name E3.
Each of these variants differs somewhat, but all contain basic programs such as Word, Excel, or Powerpoint.
And then we have the already mentioned Minecraft.
An open-world building game fit for any age.
Perhaps there is no need to introduce it, because of its popularity it has won millions of players around the world.
It should also be mentioned that we offer tailor-made applications.
Based on the customer's requirements, we can produce an app that will suit them perfectly.
If you're interested in additional information, I can give you my business card.
We will be happy to answer your questions at any time.
