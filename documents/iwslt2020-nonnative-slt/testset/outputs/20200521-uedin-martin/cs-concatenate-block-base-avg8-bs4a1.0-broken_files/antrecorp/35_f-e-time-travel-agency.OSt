Good afternoon.
My name is <NAME> and I represent the fictitious Time Travel Agency.
The company was founded in 2014. In 2018, our class took over, rebranded, and as a result, the company is now more focused on historical packages.
The team includes three leading members and twenty-two students in the 11th grade.
As I said, we combine the magic of the past with modern trends to meet customer requirements.
Each package we offer includes three basic services: transport, accommodation and meals and various other additional services.
For example, a folk art workshop, wine tasting, camps for children, riding and archery courses, night paintball, meetings and conferences.
In a show of respect for the past, Time Travel Agency will donate five percent of its profits to the castles it works with.
You can connect with us in many ways, on Facebook, by email, on Instagram and by post.
Our website is at timetravelsrl.wixsite.com.
Do not hesitate to come and see our booth number sixty-six.
Enjoy your moment with the Time Travel Agency!
Thank you for your attention.
