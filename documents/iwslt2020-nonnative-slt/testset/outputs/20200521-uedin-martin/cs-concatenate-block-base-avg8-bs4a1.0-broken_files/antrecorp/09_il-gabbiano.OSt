I work for travel agency "Il Gabbiano", would you be interested in any particular trip?
Yes, I would like to visit a European city, but I don't know which one.
Our offer covers the whole of Europe and I would recommend a cool place like Vienna because I like it. Otherwise, I can suggest Barcelona.
Could you tell me how your agency works?
We work in several groups divided by tasks. They are marketing, a client contact department, ... and they all work together to develop a tour offer.
That's great, really interesting.
Do you have a card so I can call you later for more information?
Yes, I think...
Yes, here it is.
Great.
Thank you so much.
Please.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
