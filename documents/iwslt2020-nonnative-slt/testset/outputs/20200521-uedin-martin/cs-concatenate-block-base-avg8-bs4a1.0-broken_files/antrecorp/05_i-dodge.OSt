Nice weather outside...
Yes, it's quite hot.
Well, I think today would be a good day to go out for dinner, don't you?
I do, but I don't know who with, do you know someone?
I know a wonderful Venetian entrepreneur.
Who's that?
He's standing right in front of you.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'll pick you up at 8:00 p.m.
I didn't say yes.
Where can I pick you up with my Lamborghini?
What do you mean?
Yesterday, my Lambo was sent to me by my company in Italy.
So you're in the shipping business?
Yes, I have a company based in Venice called Idoge, we carry goods around the world.
What's your company's name again?
Idoge. We also sell machines for making pasta, Italian pasta.
Oh, that's interesting.
And not only that. We started in 2016, quite recently, but our customers trust us, we are known for our professional attitude and we get a truly excellent response and rating from them.
That's why I'm inviting you to Mario's restaurant tonight so you can taste the pasta made by our machine.
Boy, you're obviously very confident.
That's because I'm proud of what I do.
So you'll be waiting for me at home?
Oh, you've made me very happy, but I've got something else.
Yeah, well, I'm used to it...
Bye, bye.
I'm sorry...
