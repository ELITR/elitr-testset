Ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I am the director of FictionalCine, a fictional company that operates cinemas, screens films and prepares educational programmes for schools.
Our company was founded in Mělník on 1st September 2018.
Our company has... had five members, but at the moment there are only four working in it.
Every month we prepare new programs and offers for customers.
As a complementary activity, we also offer refreshments to customers.
If you are interested in our educational programmes, you can contact us by email at fictionalcine, at, gmail, period, com or visit us at booth number fifty-five.
We look forward to meeting you.
Thank you.
