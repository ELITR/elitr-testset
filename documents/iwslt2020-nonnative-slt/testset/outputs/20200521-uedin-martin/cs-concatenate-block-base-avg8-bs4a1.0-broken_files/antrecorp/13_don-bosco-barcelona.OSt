I work at Hotel Bosco.
Our address is in Barcelona, in the heart of the city.
As you well know, Barcelona offers a large number of bustling tourist spots.
We're here to help you find these places and get to them.
That's why we offer you a car rental, but you can also use the public transport, which is located two minutes from our hotel.
We also offer a gym, in case you want to exercise your body.
We also have a conference room.
If you are an entrepreneur, then you have the opportunity to establish new business relationships here.
We also offer an interesting spa and swimming pool.
In our hotel you can also relax.
So much for roughly our hotel, and you'll find us at booth number one hundred and five. If you'd like to come, I'll be happy to see you.
I hope you enjoyed my presentation and thank you for coming.
