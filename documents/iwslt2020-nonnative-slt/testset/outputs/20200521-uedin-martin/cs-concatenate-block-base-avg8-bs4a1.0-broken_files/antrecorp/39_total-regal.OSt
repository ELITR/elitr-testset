Hello my friends, my name is <NAME> and I'm going to take you through today's company presentation, in which I'm going to introduce the most famous fictional company, straight out of Austria, Total Regal.
Since 1999, we have ruled the market and crushed the dreams of other companies.
In fact, our C.E.O. ran this company before any of you were even born.
Imagine that.
So where is our headquarters located?
Mountains, of course.
No, I'm joking, we actually have other cities than Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirts and short leather pants, no, I'm kidding.
In truth, though, it may be that we bring out the traditional dress for one of the countless parties we throw when we want to have a beer or something.
Well, okay, more like two beers.
So why should you buy our products?
We've been selling the most popular of our products, which by the way have become true icons, since 1999, two decades ago.
For example, Helping Hand, which is a great way to store all kinds of clothes, such as jackets, or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and handbags.
So come and see our shop and as we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
