Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I represent Trefa s.r.o.
We focus on selling sweets and sugary drinks.
One of our best-selling products is liquorice from Morocco from our business partner Mishoc.
Mishoc really has a rich history.
This licorice is one of the best species.
It's very durable.
We also buy cookies from them.
These cookies are made from 100 percent chocolate.
We also import goods from Russia.
Russia is one of our largest partners.
We buy chocolate, biscuits and sweets from them.
Although some say that Russian chocolate is not as good as Swiss or Belgian, it is also one of the best in the world.
If you'd like to try anything, you can find us at booth number eight.
You can come and taste whatever you want.
If you want to buy something, then today we have a twenty percent discount on all goods.
So that's it.
I'm glad you heard me out.
Have a nice day.
