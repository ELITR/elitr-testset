Hello, I'd like you to meet the Jizeran Company.
We're from Liberec and we brew beer.
We started out as a small group of friends who simply wanted to brew beer, but soon found that everyone liked it.
We offered it to friends and they liked it, so we started exporting it abroad and cooking it in bulk.
Today we offer four types of beer.
Ten Reichenbier, eleven Reichenbier, Reichenbier thirteen and our specialty, the dark special fifteen.
We offer beer in cans, bottles, barrels and five bottles.
Our beer is made from hops from Å½atec.
I'm glad you listened to me, and if you'd like to try our beer, you can visit us at booth number forty-five.
Thank you.
