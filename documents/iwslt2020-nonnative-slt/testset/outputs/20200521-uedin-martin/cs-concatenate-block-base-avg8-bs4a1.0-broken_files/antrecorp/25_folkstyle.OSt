Hello.
My name is <NAME> and I'm from the fictional Folkstyle Company of <CITY>.
I'd like to say a few words about our company.
Our company Folkstyle comes from Slovakia and focuses on the production of clothing and fashion accessories decorated with traditional Slovak folklore motifs.
Folklore, as you know, has a very long tradition in Slovakia and that is why we still have rich sources of ideas.
It should be stressed that all our products are hand-embroidered.
In our wide range you will find embroidered dresses, skirts, belts and also bracelets or today's very popular bow ties - I'm wearing one right now, by the way.
For our products, we draw on folk motifs from various regions of Slovakia.
We try to combine these themes with the latest fashion trends to create timeless pieces of clothing that should not be missing in any wardrobe.
We offer products for all ages that will satisfy younger and older customers.
If you order our products, you won't wait more than 30 days for the goods.
Payment is possible in cash and by bank transfer.
