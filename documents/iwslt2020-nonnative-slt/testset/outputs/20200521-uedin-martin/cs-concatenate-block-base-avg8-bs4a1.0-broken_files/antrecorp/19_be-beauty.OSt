Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
Our company is called Be Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on May 15, 2017 and was taken over by <NAME>on September 1, 2018.
We sell dresses and suits by Czech designers and tailors.
We pay attention to the quality of materials. Our clothes and suits are made from recycled and natural materials.
We would also like to mention the environmental problems in the fashion industry.
The fashion industry contributes most to environmental pollution.
And that is... over a hundred and fifty billion items of clothing are manufactured, and billions more of clothes are... burned or buried in pits.
By 2030, the fashion industry will grow as the population increases.
A typical clothing production cycle is as follows: the acquisition of materials to make fabrics, the manufacture of fabrics, the weaving of fabrics, the preparation, i.e. dyeing and printing, and finally the sewing and finishing of clothing.
Thank you for your attention, have a nice day.
