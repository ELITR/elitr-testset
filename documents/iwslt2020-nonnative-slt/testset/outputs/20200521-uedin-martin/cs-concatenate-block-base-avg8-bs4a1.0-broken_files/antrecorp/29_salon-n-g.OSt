Hello, do I know you from somewhere?
Hello, I have a feeling we've met before, maybe we went to the same school a few years ago.
Yes, and you?
Yes, what do you do now?
I'm the manager of a small business called Salon NG, which is a pet salon.
Oh, that sounds very interesting, could you tell me more about him?
Yes, of course.
We focus on caring for dogs, cats, horses and rodents.
We offer services such as claw cutting, ear cleaning or just hair trimming.
But we also offer various products, such as dog beds and bedding, animal clothes and dog food, especially without allergens, from the Czech company Ontario.
Do you have any pets?
We can provide you with the highest quality care if you're interested.
Yes, I have a dog, I'd like to get his claws cut, they're too long.
Would you give me your card, please?
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot them upstairs, but I'll get them right away.
Okay, let's go.
