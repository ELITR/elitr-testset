Hello!
What floor are you going to?
Hello, on the 15th.
And you?
The 22nd.
Do you mind if I take off my shoes?
Those high heels are killing me!
Of course.
I won't mind.
Thank you.
Why do you wear those high heels when you can wear sneakers?
I know a good shop that focuses on selling leisure shoes.
Oh, really?
Yes, I actually work for him.
It's called CaspoWalk Ltd. and we offer different types of shoes from different brands such as Nike, Adidas, for all ages and genders.
Do you offer any special shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some pairs of shoes.
This month's special offer is Danish-style clogs, and if you like sports, you'd love a brand new pair of Nike shoes called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes that you control with your phone.
You can customize the tie of your shoelaces and the color of your LEDs using the mobile app.
If I buy shoes from you, will you offer me some accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer shoelaces and insoles and many other accessories.
Here's my card.
Be sure to stop by our store.
Okay, thank you.
You can find us in this building.
We are attending a trade fair of student companies.
Thank you so much!
We got to my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
Take care.
Nice to meet you, too.
Take care.
