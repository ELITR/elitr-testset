Do you have any other questions?
If not, I would ask for the floor from our Romanian colleagues.
Well, hello.
Can you all hear me okay?
Yes?
So we have 19% VAT in place in Romania for two years now.
And although plans have been made to cut it to 18 per cent, they have been shelved for the time being.
In addition, we have two reduced VAT rates, nine per cent and five per cent.
There have been several changes over the past year in terms of products that may have a reduced rate.
The biggest change, therefore, to sewerage services, where the rate was cut from nineteen per cent to nine per cent, starting from the first of January of this year.
Other items remain unchanged.
By contrast, there have been many changes to the 5 per cent rate, mainly to some products, which were at 9 per cent and have now been reclassified to 5 per cent.
The biggest change was last seen on 1 June this year; this change concerned high-quality food and mountain products, as well as traditional products.
And for products made in the mountains, the cows or sheep that produce them must live there for at least half their lives.
The manufacturer must get them an approval, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
He will then be able to apply a reduced rate.
Then there is the reverse charge mechanism.
In Romania, both companies need to be registered in order to be able to use the system.
There are fourteen products for which this can be shortened, and in December two thousand and eighteen had to be for some of them the deadline is extended until twenty-two.
Finally, the system of apportioning value added tax, which was introduced in the year two thousand and seventeen, although it now seems to have been somewhat forgotten by the Treasury.
In the year two thousand and seventeen, it started with more than four hundred companies, and now in the year two thousand and nineteen, the number has fallen to forty-six per cent.
Moreover, in the year two thousand and eighteen, no new companies began to use the system.
So all the companies that started with this have since started to go back to the normal VAT system from that system.
In addition, the European Commission has ordered Romania to stop using the system.
So the system seems to have failed to deliver what was expected of it, so the ministry is likely to stop using it altogether.
Completely?
I base myself on the data we have, because no new companies were registered in the year two thousand and eighteen, nor in the year two thousand and nineteen.
So there are only companies in the system that started in year two thousand and seventeen, and their numbers are slowly decreasing.
With regard to all these findings, there are still some regulatory gaps with regard to the MOSS system, which in Romania is for some reason referred to as M1SS because it has been translated.
But that's the way it is.
In addition, we lack IT systems at the financial services offices that can cooperate with each other and exchange data.
Which will not make things any easier for companies, and last year we finally introduced the electronic system they have in Belgium.
They have introduced electronic cash registers and companies are now obliged to start using them, so the tax authorities are checking that all companies have them installed.
However, for the time being, we are not sure whether the system is fully operational due to the limits in the financial authorities' IT system.
And so far, no new trends have been identified.
So, that's it.
Thank you.
