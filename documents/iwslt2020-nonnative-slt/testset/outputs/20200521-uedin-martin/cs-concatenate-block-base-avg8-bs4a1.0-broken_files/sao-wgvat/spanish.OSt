Okay, so we did this audit.
The audit report will be published on 16 July.
Therefore, keep this information confidential.
They are under an information embargo until the date of publication.
We await the Commission's response in all 23 official EU languages.
Because we only have an answer in English, so it's just a formality and the audit is now over.
The title was 'Many challenges...' and the special report will read 'Many challenges in collecting VAT on customs duties remain to be solved'.
It remains to be resolved.
Originally it was going to be "There will be a need for reflection" but some have already been addressed to some extent through new legislation, a new Commission proposal which has just mentioned <CENSORED>.
However, there are still problems to be solved and we will see later.
So I'll start with why we chose this auditing topic.
What we're looking at.
They're looking for something.
And we'll conclude with our recommendations.
First of all, ok, we did a survey because we are following up on previous research analyses.
Based on the findings of the head of these institutions in the field of e-commerce, German colleagues, Lithuanian colleagues carried out audits.
Also, in the previous decision we made on imports, we analyse the issue of distance from non-EU countries and the related issues on VAT and customs duties, and we decided that it was worth going deeper during this audit.
The problem is that honest traders are often excluded from the market by dishonest traders and can no longer compete.
This is a problem that has also been raised by academics such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and is particularly intense in the UK.
Loss estimates, too.
There are only estimates of distances from outside the EU.
But these estimates are not very encouraging, because even though the commission estimates only five billion a year, in the UK it is between £1 and £1.5 billion a year.
That's how they assessed the losses.
This represents an 8 to 10% reduction in UK VAT.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently only accounts for four percent.
So three times the fight against fraud in the UK is represented by the volume of e-commerce losses on goods bought from third countries.
This is the mission.
We are not counting distance selling within the EU here, we are not counting the majority of electronic services here.
So the bottom line is to highlight our concerns.
Then what we are focusing on is that we are going to visit five Member States - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we took into account the number of MOS registrations in both non-EU and US programmes.
Also the volume of electronic sales within the EU and, finally, the estimated amount of VAT foregone as a result of the VAT exemption on imports of goods of negligible value (LVCR).
Following a study by our source at the commission, we also visited the commission.
These steps should debug the technology and the World Customs Organisation, and the repeal period ran from 2015 to the end of 2018.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal that has been tabled and all the proposals that will come into force in 2021.
What are we focusing on?
We have, of course, begun to analyse the responses to our survey, namely the survey sent by the main group two.
We are continuing with a questionnaire in all the Member States that we have visited with interviews with all sorts of people.
We have gained access and, what is also very important, we have set up access to ABC data to the Synergia database, i.e. the database of incidents, problems that Member States report in the MOS system.
We have been given access to all fiscali (fiscal) and e-commerce project groups and all BUT-related project groups where there is a lot of information and discussion about how the MOS works.
And, of course, we got funding from supporting institutions from Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and we ended up doing our own samples of different transactions.
Overall, we have combined nearly nine hundred e-commerce-related transactions.
What we are finding, of course, was first the positive things and then we will continue with the most negative things.
The regulatory framework is governed by best international practices, which have the extremes of the OECD and the World Customs Organisation.
In most respects concerning the OECD, with the exception of this principle, the principle of taxation at destination has been respected in most cases.
There is now a new threshold below ten thousand euros that you can file in the Member State of origin, so it is not in line with the OECD.
In the case of the World Customs Organisation, which deals with imported packages, the immediate release guidelines were followed in most respects, as well as the new proposal under the standards.
The Commission is a pioneer in this area, adapting to the World Customs Organisation and standards in most respects.
As for the new provision, which will enter into force in 2021...
I am trying to address some of the weaknesses, but for us, the main problem that will continue to occur is undervaluation.
Losses from VAT and customs duties are experience and will continue to be.
And this cannot be addressed by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As for trade with non-EU countries, this will not be resolved and we will see why later.
Why, because administrative cooperation agreements with third countries do not work.
We have a new agreement with Norway.
We expect a change of information with Norway that it will work, but that's not a problem.
It's not Norway, the problem is China, it's the United States of America.
The information chain with China doesn't work because the Chinese counterpart isn't responding and the response rate goes down and down and down, so that's the problem.
If we have information about a change of supplier who is not working through an electronic interface, i.e. working directly on his website, who has not registered with the MOS or even registered and after we cancel the registration, he opens a new website...
So how come we pay VAT from Europe to China, and we expect VAT to come back to the EU.
Unless we also have the cooperation of the administration.
That will never happen.
This is a problem even among EU countries, it is not working as expected.
Also the cooperation of the administration, so we will see later that the controls carried out by the national tax authorities are weak.
Because there are virtually no tools to carry out the proper chance risk analysis that we have already mentioned.
Therefore, it will be necessary for the Member State to approve the Commission's proposal to amend the information, with payment service providers under the Commission's control being insufficient.
And we'll see later, of course, that the board did not do any monitoring about it, any monitoring.
There are weaknesses in the electronic check-in systems themselves.
The traditional problem, of course, is that traders undervalued goods to be below the euro threshold of twenty-two or ten years for VAT.
And that will disappear in the future, but they will continue to undervalue to pay lower VAT.
It will not be approved, but they will pay less and, as far as customs obligations are concerned, the assumption is set at one hundred and fifty euros and they cannot cope.
Because in all electronic ... we will see the EU's electronic clearing system later, they cannot stop the declaration.
Because they tick the box of their own electronic..., which they apply to the customer electronically for relief purposes.
And they passed the system, even though they declared a value that was over a hundred and fifty.
The electronic system can't stop it, they said it was something very serious because the operators working there are promising economic operators.
So, the big couriers have the authority of the Economic Operators Association and claim to be the most reliable, but they abuse the system.
Enforcing the collection of VAT duties is not effective.
Okay, provision for a chain of information on recoveries related to this tax.
They were rarely used, out of the five Member States we visited, only in Austria.
Only in five cases, so it's not often used.
We analyse the mismatch of payments between Member States.
We have an approach to harmonisation by the Commission and there are still missed combinations.
Important means a lot between Member States.
In the Netherlands, of course, the problem is that they fail to harmonise, which explains the amounts of VAT received with the VAT return.
And the problems are also with the reminders that even our colleagues from NKU yesterday...
They anticipated a problem with Member States' comments on consumption which are not ...
Here is a summary of our findings on MOS samples.
We concluded that the MOS IT infrastructure suits its purposes, so it is strong.
It can be handled by the user, so the IT infrastructure is solid, but there are problems with registration and payments between Member States.
For example, as regards the analysis of the occurrence reported in Synergie, in the Synergie database between Member States, but in five Member States there are only a few twenty-two cases.
Which we have reviewed, in which Member State with the origin of the problem and as an affecting Member State.
There were only 12 cases, so there were not as many cases, the problem is that the attitude of the Member States was really passive.
It was only when the problems escalated that they started working on it, but it takes a long time to solve the problems.
As far as MOS is concerned, it takes long periods, but there are not many problems.
Also, in terms of technical error messages sent and received between Member States, the response is also very passive, not being proactive only when the problem escalates as an incident to which they start to respond.
But this infrastructure for MOS is robust.
We have assessed whether they are ready for a single point of contact.
We have received several complaints, particularly from Austria.
They say they will not be ready, even from the Dutch route, which we have not analysed, because the system is being developed mainly on demand using a single point of contact for import.
Registration issues are here.
We need to distinguish between the non-US and the EU system, only eighty per cent of registrations were not properly checked.
As far as the known system outside the US is concerned and we have even found it, we have found cases of double registration, which is something serious, then as far as payments are concerned, the problem in particular is the problem of missing reminders in the Member State of consumption.
And sometimes by Member State of identification.
And problems with registration and deregistration.
This is the most related administrative cooperation, it is an exchange of information between the Member States we have visited.
And here we compare with the overall activity of information chains, which we see, for example, that there are overall information requirements that have been sent to one hundred and eighty-two compared to the overall information requirements.
They are generally unrelated to the normal nine thousand two hundred, so even in the UK many of them will not be more problematic, for example triple problematic.
The level of the information chain is good, it is very low, and also some Member States have not changed, which is not why we recommend separating the CNO centralised home office.
A separate structure designed for e-commerce, or at least for the MoS, so the level of transmission of information is very weak.
Then we have multilateral controls, in two cases there were six cases of multilateral controls.
It was a really successful experience.
However, in two cases this was not successful at all because the Member State of identification refused to participate in the multilateral control.
This is something that should be solved by enforcing new legislation, because now two Member States can ask for a check to be carried out.
And another is the recent request that the second Member State of identification cannot refuse such participation.
So hopefully it will improve, but there are other significant things for Eurofisc.
There were four hundred and eighty signals, a chain through Eurofisc working for e-commerce as many as five, and only one feedback on those four hundred and eighty.
Therefore, the Member State did not find this information very useful, they do not know why only five Member States were selected, they entered the elderly in the database.
And others didn't read it because they didn't find the information very useful.
So there are also a few signals related to trends or fraud themes, three or four topics that they find useful.
And then there are the changing tools for web crawling, but that's something that some members are taking over legally in their country.
In other Member States, internal legislation prevents them from using web crawling tools.
Now the work file is frozen and frozen activities are not useful.
They are awaiting the design of an information chain between the payment service provider.
Because they will, they will be databases and they will have access.
This is the Commission's proposal regarding all information provided by the payment service provider to any other country, the Commission's proposal.
Of course, we are very supportive and we are putting a proposal in the report, but I did not know until I asked yesterday that the Commission also needed some support for this proposal because Lubik Lubis said there were problems.
However, I took this as a matter of course in the council, because this proposal comes from some discussion in some forums with Member States and with stakeholders.
Hopefully... this is very important because another problem is the lack of controls, audits for the MoS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here that it's nobody, because it never is, how can I, if not, I don't know that I don't have an analysis of data areas.
So my audit is going to be a random selection with maybe a lot of information and no records, so they're going to need some data and this is the data.
In addition, the company will have many more applications.
Yeah, they seem to understand about Germany because we have the data.
A team outside the U.S., but information he may have at his disposal.
Phenomenon.
But I don't know any more, there is virtually no control.
Controls on knowledge about intra-EU distances have also been less than successful.
The customs office therefore has the results of a sample from a courier of and abuse of postal services.
At the post office the main problem in dealing with the undervaluation issue is you have drones very expensive drones declared under ten units or under twenty two euros.
Samples per se are a thousand times as simple.
And they can read and it's very difficult to handle at Post Office level.
And for a courier, they take advantage of the usual hundred-and-fifty relief, because they just tick the takeover box and then fifty can't close.
Declaration to stop the declaration, although devaluation higher than a hundred and fifty, we check that not only in the sample, also directly in the custom electronic system in the environment of the dam, where we have carried out several experiments.
Member States did not work in any Member State, only in Austria did it work.
But he didn't receive it in Austria.
We filed another alcohol declaration.
And then for alcohol it was enforced and because this categorisation is applicable to alcoholic products.
So there are also some errors in the Austrian system.
This, and the problem, is therefore the authorised economic operator exploiting this system by the most reliable custom traders.
We also have a recommendation for the commission to make use of the structures provided in mutual assistance treaties with non-EU countries.
To solve these problems, solve the problems and find out the lack of answers.
Also inspect Member States' controls at local level for relief.
At a minimum, monitor the operation of distance selling within the EU, mixed goods this recommendation is the only thing the commission has not accepted.
That's why they laughed last night, because your job is
Monitor the commission and <CENSORED 22:25> said: "Yes, yes, yes."
I laughed, but okay.
They help the Member State to develop a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for new arrivals.
Because this is a problem, we can't know whether the system works or not.
Most systems are supposed to be successful, but this is usually an assumption, which is why we have an estimate of the largest VAT gap.
We do not know whether the system is successful and we have no estimate for the European Union itself, so that would be very important.
As the Commission assists Member States in development, this is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative solutions.
Perhaps there could be help to tackle VAT fraud in the form of an alternative system for distributing payments.
Using blockchain technology, routes are designed, KPMG KPMG and also a design by Professor E. Ensworth.
There are very interesting proposals that we have, of course, discussed with the commission, and the Commission says that they are theoretical, they practically come to solutions.
In fact, they did not find a practical application, Professor Lamas also made several proposals to use the technology for imports from outside the EU.
But this system is accepted by many other countries.
There's no practical experience, but I think it's worth also going deeper with blockchain technology offering opportunities.
This is something that is also being examined by the Commission for the management of a database of important convenience stores.
Numbers to manage the validity of these numbers.
It is very important who it is for the future, the only way to deal with the use of the name of the new technology for the Member States.
Of course, we like the fact that they are starting to respond to fraudulent seniors and are adapting Eurofisc.
Also follow the compromise in line with the new limit value of EUR 10,000.
This is something that Czech colleagues highlighted in their report.
And we also took that into account for the reason they explained earlier.
In order to have a separate MOS and a remote co-ordination function for colleagues, we need to ensure that the trader can introduce the VAT rate, the correct VAT rate in the MOS VAT returns.
Because when a trader introduces the wrong VAT rate, they only receive advice, but the return can be sent anyway, so they receive advice, but it will still be sent.
Also do the necessary checks after receiving a registration application in MOS to avoid this issue of double registrations.
Increase the audit work of most of the MoS's distance traders and retailers using administrative cooperation tools.
Employee of regular VAT estimates in e-commerce.
So if for this recommendation to the Member States, we would be very grateful if you would remember in your home country the importance of following our recommendations.
That is why we seek your cooperation on this matter, and that is all we know if you have any questions.
