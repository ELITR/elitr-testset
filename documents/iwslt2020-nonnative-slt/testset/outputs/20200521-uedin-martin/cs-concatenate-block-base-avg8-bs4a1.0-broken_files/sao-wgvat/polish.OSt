If you please.
I would like to ask our Polish colleagues to give their presentation.
Thank you.
And just to refresh my memory, I would like to say a few words about the new regulations and new instruments that were introduced last year and during this year.
We introduced you to some of them at our plenary session in Warsaw last year.
So those of you who were in Warsaw should know something about it.
I would therefore briefly recall some of them and then tell you about our previous audit in this area and our conclusions.
First of all, I would like to mention the single audit file.
We started implementing these tools three years ago.
However, last year was the last stage, as the first stage was that a single set of audits had to be submitted to the tax authorities on request.
And now it's an automatic system.
The information shall be submitted electronically without any request.
And since July 1 of last year
this is mandatory for all types of economic operators.
Since 2016.
it was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, smaller and now for all businesses.
I will come back to that, too, because we see this as crucial in the fight against VAT cuts.
The second piece of legislation that I would like to mention is the so-called 'Fuel Package', and even in this case the regulation was introduced gradually.
It depends on the type of business and its main idea is that fuel trading licences are granted only to companies having their registered office in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign companies are registered for VAT, in their own countries, the same types of companies can benefit from their excise duty suspension procedures respecting the purchase of fuel within the Community, and VAT incurred as a result of the purchase of fuel within the Community will have to be paid immediately after the goods are dispatched to Poland or after the end of the excise duty suspension procedure.
Another regulation is the transport package.
It must be said that the draft of this law is based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this type was introduced in Hungary and in Poland we have introduced this system of tracking goods transport only for certain types of certain categories of goods.
They are generally goods on which excise duty is levied.
I am thinking of fuel, tobacco and some others, and by monitoring I am thinking of monitoring how these goods are transported by road or rail.
This means that each individual transport has to be declared before the start of the transport, in a separate system, a dedicated system and, since last year, every single transport has been linked to a geolocation system.
So for every single truck, you can tell where it is right now.
Roads, parking lots, etc.
And the finance minister for the Ministry of Finance, which analyses the whole big data system that has been delivered online, some of the public institutions, and so as we know, there may be many results and there may be some inconsistencies with many, and many may have found a business entity that provides them with this transport in a way that is abnormal in terms of routes, time, etc.
And we plan to audit the Treasury this year.
How is the Treasury prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is in place in the sense that all these companies have to register all traffic and the system is ready in the sense of the analysis being done online.
However, we do not yet know if the finance minister will use this information for any actions carried out by the tax authorities.
The next piece of legislation is to some extent similar to what our colleague who specialises in technical issues presented yesterday.
So we have a certain blacklist, but in Poland a blacklist means a list of entities that have been removed from the VAT register.
And we have an information-based system, again given by online banks and other entities of the financial system.
This system can be used by the Minister of Finance to identify potential irregularities and problems, and is aimed at capturing unusual transactions and providing information about them to the tax authorities online.
And based on that information, the IRS can block an account, a bank account, and a specific transaction.
What is the risk that a higher fine than, say, 10,000 Euro will be enforced?
Another piece of legislation is the distribution of payments, which was introduced last year.
It's optional at the moment.
But it's really up to the buyer.
If one contractor uses it, then the method of payment for the supplier is, of course, mandatory.
Importantly, if this mechanism of apportionment of payments is applied, then joint and several liability of the taxpayer is excluded.
I'm going to show you some numbers and in a little while I'm going to tell you about how this distribution can be used in a payment mechanism.
Finally, here is one legislative and organisational tool that our colleague from the Ministry of Finance presented in some detail last year.
So we have a new national revenue administration here, based on the previous free administration, and now we have another administration that fights tax and customs in one system.
Plus the online registration system
Ha ha ha.
At the moment we have a mandatory type of cash register system and a mandatory element of these cash registers is electronic memory.
So the IRS is able to verify authorized types of cash registers based on memory, but we are starting with an online system registration system only for some sectors.
These are primarily legal services, medical services, just some specific sectors.
The implication is that we must begin work on creating a central system, headed by the head of the national revenue administration.
In this system, all such transactions should be immediately and easily registered online.
And that is why we are engaging in this debate, so that we can introduce possible distributions of payments to all taxpayers affected by this.
This effectively means that we would like the tax authorities to wish to replace the reverse charge mechanism with such a payment and reverse charge mechanism and joint and several liability.
Thus, in all sectors where the devolved tax liability or joint and indivisible liability is mandatory, all of these sectors could be covered by this payment allocation mechanism.
Now, as I said before, let me tell you something about our audit.
We did the audit last year.
The period for which the audit was carried out was quite long - it was 12 years, which is why we were asked by the Public Finance Committee of the same Polish chamber of Parliament to carry out such an audit.
We have come to the following conclusions.
We had to conclude that the effectiveness of the Treasury's work has been highly volatile over this long period.
Between 2010 and 2015, the Ministry and the tax authorities made, in our opinion, somewhat insufficient efforts to improve their efficiency in the area of VAT receipts.
As the subject of the audit was the Ministry of Finance's supervision of tax revenues, or the collection of taxes, namely the collection of VAT, this was reflected here.
One sign of this aforementioned volatility in work efficiency is
so called VAT GAP.
And during those years, the VAT GAP in Poland averaged 24 percent, which was about ten points higher than the EU median.
Among other things, we concluded that surveillance had not been effectively contacted.
So that's it.
It can be said that we have information about VAT GAP in Poland and EU countries and that we have numbers from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And as you can see, the average VAT GAP difference in Europe is certainly lower than in Poland; even without taking into account the source of the information, the figures speak quite clearly.
Mmmm.
I have already mentioned that our main tool and the main tool of the tax authorities, and also the idea that was put into practice during this period, was a single set of audits, and over the last two years the tax authorities have acquired the competence to use databases to analyse them .
For example, in 2017, four million invoices were automatically analysed, but only 3,300 alerts were issued based on these analyses.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed did not increase much - it was about five million, but the analysis generated more than 350,000 alerts.
This has been reflected in revenue, as the first stage is automatic analysis and then comes a warning sent by text or email.
So without any official procedure in tax proceedings etc.
And this system, or its first phase, the automatic phase, has brought us additional revenue, VAT revenue worth more than EUR 150 million per year.
I am talking about the figures for 2017 and 2018.
It should be noted that the increase in revenue occurred under conditions of a good economic situation and an improvement in VAT collection, which was the result of a wide-ranging package of legislative and organisational changes introduced in recent years.
Yet we are of the opinion that one of the main sources of these results, of these financial results, is precisely the introduction of this single set of audits.
As a result of another instrument, this mechanism for apportioning payments in 2018 was followed by the use of a mechanism for apportioning payments, which, as I have already said, was optional.
However, we are seeing an increased interest in making payments in this way.
In July last year, taxpayers made 600,000 transactions.
In December, there were more than one and a half million transactions using the split payment mechanism.
The value of the tax paid through this split payment mechanism in July was half a billion euros.
And half a billion euros as of December 1st.
In total, over the period from July to December last year, more than seven million transactions were made by taxpayers using the payment-apportionment mechanism, and the tax amount in the special VAT accounts reached around six billion euros.
And one more piece of information on the work of the tax authorities, last year the tax authorities and the Ministry made 30 percent fewer checks than in 2017, but with fewer checks, the percentage of checks that were found to be irregular increased.
In our view, this is the result of the new electronic tools that have been introduced, which have helped to better select the bodies for which checks should be carried out.
It is clear that the reduction in the number of checks has been achieved by accompanying the reduction in the number of checks with an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is clearly less painful and time-consuming for taxpayers.
This led to a 100 percent increase in findings last year compared to 2017.
So, in general, we think that several legislative instruments have been put in place over the past couple of years.
In sum, the results are sufficient.
However, we must not forget that this was done in economically favourable conditions.
So it's not entirely possible to determine exactly what proportion of this increased revenue was due to which factor.
Whether this is the result of new organisational and legislative instruments
or if the overall economic situation is responsible.
That's all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions, please ask.
