So we would like to continue. I kindly ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to give its presentation.
Well, I hereby present our current status.
We have two national laws to make two directives for European regulation.
One is about paper and digital publications.
Now they have the same rate.
And in some circumstances, it's a zero rate, but in other circumstances, it's six percent.
In the case of rental property we have accepted ...the possibility of rental property ... ... and the mandatory VAT on short-term rental property.
Then we did two audits.
One concerns... what we've heard here several times, so I'll be very brief about it.
The second concerns the cash register system.
And then we also have two new four trends.
Our audit of the MoS... is not yet complete, nor is it published.
Therefore, all conclusions and recommendations are only preliminary.
But we are almost certain there will be no major changes.
Hmmm.
Our conclusions are essentially the same as what we have already heard here today.
But as far as we are concerned, I will just point out some things that are different, but which I think are more or less specific to Belgium.
We currently have only a limited number of staff in administration because we are more or less a beneficiary unlike MSID, which transfers money, and we depend heavily on other Member States.
But in the future, when MOS expands the most, more staff will be needed.
And they should now be trained and known up front.
Another general conclusion that we have reached, but which has also been made here, is that there have been changes in control strategies.
What needs to happen is a new line of thinking.
But our administration believes strongly in another MSID, because if we look at conclusions like MSCON...
Just jump from one to the other.
So we see that there is a very poor control strategy.
Therefore, we strongly believe that each MSID will send or transfer the money.
That's on us.
However, we stressed the importance of making some progress on the control strategy, by creating risk profiles.
So far, our administration hasn't been able to create good risk profiles because they don't have enough data, but they think they will in the future.
I have more data in the future and I could create some risk profiles, so in the future we will monitor whether the control policy will be better.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We follow other taxpayers on the internet, so there is a system to search for taxpayers on the internet.
But for now, the results are rather poor.
There are not many things about taxpayers that can be traced.
Then we see that...
The MSIDD registration process is fine as such, but in circumstances where taxpayers are logged out...
There's no follow-up if they file a return in the regular system.
So there is no link or any follow-up system, which we think is important.
Then we have ... in the process of filing a confession.
There are some automatic checks, which we find very interesting.
So it's not a real check of completeness and correctness (yes, thank you) of completeness and correctness.
Still, it helps when common mistakes are made.
Actual checks must therefore be carried out by MSCON, but as MSID, but Belgium still helps to complete the returns, so some errors are made.
There will be an alert in the system, or if you have to make a selection and all options are limited, just click on the possible options, so there will be fewer errors.
As MSCON, we also found out that they work in the Benelux.
So, together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they have created a matrix of certain risks and are developing new control activities.
In function of these risks and there are already two test sets that have started so far.
We therefore recommend working further in this small group to make progress and disseminate knowledge to European forums.
I think it's the differences that we had as opposed to what we hadn't heard before.
So we're going to do a second audit.
The cash register system has been audited.
This is not an audit carried out by Luden and myself, but carried out by other members of the audit cell.
It was also an audit that was a bit wider than just VT, but I will only present the conclusions and recommendations that are important for VT.
The audit focused on the effectiveness and efficiency of control policy.
Installation and application, so they looked at two issues related to the cash register system.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations they have drawn are that the regulation is too complex.
They therefore recommend simplification, because there are too many exceptions in the Regulation to the national Regulation.
That it was very difficult to establish a particular group on the basis of a statement alone.
And so it was very difficult to track or control certain groups of companies that had to install a cash register system.
Another big conclusion was the control policy.
There are problems with the taxpayer's choice of the cash register system.
If there was a limit, there's a limit, and if the admission is too low, then you fall right below that limit, and there's no control anymore, so this was a way to escape legislation.
There was also a problem with cross-checks of information data from taxpayer collection databases for their control.
Another conclusion was that there were poor internal controls for the application of the system as well.
As for the fines that were issued, they found that different inspection units gave different fines.
So there were no rules on fines, but some were very strict and other inspection teams were not strict at all, or had fines much lower than the rates they gave for certain errors, as well as risk analysis and online access.
It would be an advantage, but it is not implemented now, so the risk analysis was very simple and there is no online access, but as soon as we learned that this kind of system exists in other countries when they have online access.
They found that this could be a very good advantage.
Then there was also an exchange of information with the national social security office, which wasn't very good.
So a lot of information didn't get from one to the other.
Finally, about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with inserting transactions
As such, the system works very well if it is used, when it is used, as if it should be used, but when certain transactions were not entered into the system, they could not be discovered.
The solution could therefore be to create a media campaign so that customers can apply for a ticket.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise it will not be a ticket or that the legislation would be tailored to accept only electronic payments, because then it would be easier to track the money.
As an actual impact, however, there is no reliable measurement of impact management, so they have no idea.
Our team then ran some tests and tried to find an impact, but found that there was an expectation effect because the system was delayed for several years.
But everyone knew it was coming, so customers and companies were already expecting legislation that was going to make a change and introduce this system.
The exact differences between VAT receipts before and after 2016, when the system was introduced, were therefore very difficult to trace.
Because already a couple of years before 2016, VAT returns were getting bigger in light of the new system, which would have been subject to change.
Our team wasn't sure of the effect.
It's just this system or that the effect was even greater because it started earlier than they thought.
Look, I can interrupt you, I just, I have a problem, or I'd like to get it right.
What do I mean by a cash register system?
Does this mean that this cashier system is registered somewhere in the database?
No, it's not, it's online, it's a cash register, yeah "cash register."
Oh, okay, so it's just for cafes, hotels and restaurants.
It's only for a particular industry.
So far it is only in the Horeca sector and it is a system that registers every transaction or should register every projection that is embedded in the system.
(So) There is no online access.
This is why the selection of the control group is so important, because the control teams have to go to different places.
They can't target it online on a computer, they have to go to HoReCa and connect their computer to the checkout.
To pull data out of it and run a check.
Yes, but they can't do it remotely.
They always have to drive themselves to the facility.
So that's why the confession is too low and it's below the limit.
Teams won't go there to see if they know the caf√©, for example, and they know there's a lot of customers and they're not there, but that's just a coincidence.
But that's something they found out later, so it's going to be them.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was afraid I was the only one who didn't understand.
Okay, but then what's the difference between this system that you're talking about a cash register at any retailer, I mean in food?
So what's so special about this particular system is that you're there.
There is special software that offers any possibility of system fraud and it is also software that ensures that data is transferable to the computer of control teams.
Whereas with a conventional cash register system, you can't extract data in the same way.
So it's the cash register systems that they have.
Yes, they're also special, but there are, I think, five different stamps of cash register systems from which you can choose and they're certified.
That all data that can be extracted in data formats is suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yeah, yes, so compatibility is certified, which is the main part of the domain of the different sections.
Yes, you mentioned this risk analysis, that there is a lack of risk services analysis, or they were not all carried out or.
Do I mean an online approach to this analysis or?
Online access to your own cash register system.
Okay, so that could make the checks a lot easier, okay, and because we can do automatic checks or data extraction.
Which could be put into a larger system, and risk analysis was actually very basic because they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or this system was only introduced in 2016, so they only had two years of data.
Okay, in conclusion.
I have two new fraudulent trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called Matrimony, which involved registering a large number of foreign companies.
But always by the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulgarian.
But they registered names that were very similar to well-known names.
There was only a single letter difference, just to make the plausible assumption that these companies existed, but most of them didn't exist at all.
And then they just filed a VAT return and asked for a VAT refund with false invoices, but they always did that in writing and for very small amounts.
Which means the administration had to input all the information into the system, which took time
Therefore, some refunds had already been made before they could actually establish that there was a possibility of fraud and could check whether the company actually existed and whether the invoices mentioned were real.
However, this type of fraud has been discovered and information about it is already being disseminated through eurofisc, so I think every tax administration is already aware of this type of fraud.
Another fraud involved green energy certificates, which were very similar to earlier CO3-2 certificates.
The fraudulent scheme was more or less the same in that they sent invoices.
Or they used the invoices of a firm that looked a lot like the law firm that was otherwise supposed to send the invoices.
So we had a plan of deception, I cut it really short, and I don't have a picture of it.
But let me put it this way.
There was a company A in Member State X which, according to the certificates from B in another Member State A, sold those certificates to C.
Again another Member State Z and sent that company an invoice from the corresponding A with a comma...
So that's a company name that's only one letter different from the original.
So Company C would not see that fraud is actually taking place.
And of course Company A and Company A with a comma were the same managers that have this Company A, and A with a comma would be the missing trader.
I hope this kind of fraud is clear.
And that was the end of my presentation.
