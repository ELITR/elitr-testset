shade 109
just to repeat if we wanted to break down 109
it would literally be 109 percent which is the same thing
like 109 for and now I could re-write a cent
but we already know that
A cent means 100 literally so this is
means 109 out of 100
if we had 100 out of 100 we would have one whole
but now we have more than the whole
we have 109 out of 100
we can write it as a ratio or a fraction
it's the same thing as 109 divided by 100
equal to 109/100
let's shade it out
here we have the whole we will
consider this square as a whole
in the last video we did the math
it's a 10 by 10 square
is divided into 100 parts
we want to get 109 of these 100 parts
how it will look
it means we shade everyone
100 parts here
I'll do it with a new color
so let's color this whole
if we colored just that we would have 100
it would be 100 divided by 100 or 100 out of 100 or 100
I think it's becoming clear to you
I don't want you to just memorize it
literally that means 100 out of 100, or whole
so it's a whole square
it's 100 out of 100 here
the question is to color 109
we've already done 100 out of 100 but we still have to do another 9
so let's color another 9
so now we have 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9
this piece right here
That's exactly it
it's 9 whole squares
this is 100 of the whole square
if we take this whole piece and add this blue part to it
we get 109 one
entire square
I hope it makes sense
