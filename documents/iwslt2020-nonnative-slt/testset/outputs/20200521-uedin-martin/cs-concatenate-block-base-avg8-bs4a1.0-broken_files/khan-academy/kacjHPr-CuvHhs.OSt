welcome we'll tell you about the internet
which is what you're using
the internet is a large network of interconnected computers
and by 2014, more than
a billion websites
whole billion
not long ago it was only a million
and it was already a lot
what we use the site for
they used them at first
scientists to share their research
for example, a particle accelerator
but now everyone uses them for almost anything
it is possible to write with your family via social networks
share with others photos
of their cute kittens
Trips abroad can be planned at travel portals
and on those intelligence
to find out what's going on
and then of course you need to use the site
khan academy for study
so what's your favorite site
I actually have a slightly better question for you
what a page you are missing on the internet should look like
maybe a page about you
or something you like
the cool thing is that you can program such a page yourself
and you can learn it here at the khan academy
think about what you want to create first
because soon you'll learn how to do it
but for starters, let's get the terminology straight
what exactly is the Internet
like I said it's a lot
linked computers to websites
when a computer is connected to the internet and provides a website
we call it a server
by English serve serve
the website is written in three languages
html forming the page structure
css then edits its appearance and javascript page makes it interactive
how users see these sites
we use an internet browsing app to do this
such as chrome firefox or internet explorer
these applications we call browsers
browsers are all trying to display the page anyway
but they have some differences
that's why we sometimes say
oops an error occurred try using a different browser
what browser you are using right now
you have to use that browser on a device
maybe on a laptop phone tablet or smart TV
we call all these devices clients
clients can be very different
some are smaller than others
some have touchscreens others have keyboards
some are black and white
websites try to look good
on all different devices
and what equipment you use
and that's the Internet
thus its two-minute version
there's a lot more we can learn about it
but I think it's time to start writing some html and css
and create your own website
