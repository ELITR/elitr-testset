London interbank offer rate
to understand this a little bit better we have set up two banks here
bank a and bank b and you may already know
that if you go and put your money in the bank
the bank won't keep all that money
the way he makes money is that he lends a good portion of the money to other people as credit
and keeps just enough money at hand
these things you know people could actually come in and claim their money from their current account
we have enough at hand
you can imagine that every now and then a bank gets into a situation where it's short on cash
or it can get close to mandatory minimum reserves
that a country's central bank requires a bank to have
in these situations, let's say a bank and it gets into that situation
said we'll go and borrow some money
we go and borrow money from another bank
this is interbank lending
bank b here is overwhelmed with cash
they say we don't want to hold that much cash
we want to lend it we can actually get interest on cash we don't get interest
maybe a bank b lends money to a bank and
maybe lend as much cash
this is the new cash that the bank got and
right here is the new cash
and of course it's credit
this is a new loan to balance it out remember
that assets are equal to liabilities plus equity
commitments are all here
this is a bank loan b for this cash
have a slightly better reserve
and now the bank's loan b increased and their cash has decreased
this is a loan to a bank and
they took this cash here and gave it to the bank and
and the rate at which they lent it
needed 1 year rate
and of course it's renewed every day it's an overnight rate
this rate is the interbank rate
what they're doing on behalf of the British Bankers' Association
doing research in a number of banks in London
8 12 16 banks in London
they said look at what rate you're all trading
and determine that
determines this as the overnight libor rate
determined it will say 12 across all banks from the survey
but what's interesting about the libor rate is that it's listed in ten currencies
it's not just in sterling dollars
or yen it's in ten currencies
that's what sets it apart from other things
but it really distinguishes it from the actual federal funds rate which is another interbank lending rate
but that's in usa
and more subject to political pressures
the federal bank is actually trying to change that
