we have the role devon is going to do 3 shelves for
of his father
has a piece of board that is 12 meters long
wants the top shelf to be half a metre shorter than
middle shelf
I'll do it in different colors
so he wants the top shelf to be half a metre shorter than
middle shelf
read the whole entry first
and the lower shelf should be half a metre shorter than twice the length
top shelf
select a different color
I'll do it in blue
the bottom shelf will be half a metre shorter than double
upper shelf lengths
how long the individual shelves will be if
consumes the entire 12-metre board
let's mark the variables of different shelf lengths
because that's what we have to calculate
we have the top shelf and the middle shelf
and bottom shelf
so let's say t denotes the length of the top shelf
t denotes the length of the top shelf
and m will be equal to the length of the middle shelf
m stands for middle shelf
a b will indicate the length of the bottom shelf
b is therefore the bottom shelf
now we find out what these different statements tell us
so the first statement says that devon wants to have a top shelf
use the same color wants to have the top
a shelf half a metre shorter than the middle shelf
so he wants the length of the top shelf to be
half a metre smaller than the length of the middle shelf
we have all the variables in meters so we can write
middle shelf length minus
12 meters
exactly this is what the orange-underlined sentence tells us
the top shelf must be 12 metres shorter than the length
middle shelf
so and what the next statement tells us
and the bottom shelf must be
12 meters shorter than
double the length of the top shelf
so it's 12 meters less than double
upper shelf lengths
these are both statements written down
using equations
the length of the top shelf is equal to the length of the middle shelf
minus 12
is 12 meters shorter than the middle shelf
and the bottom shelf must be 12 metres shorter than
double the length of the top shelf
so and how do we solve it
no only with these two equations to solve it
we can't but there's more information in the entry
we have entered here how long the individual shelves will be if
devon uses the full 12 metres of plank
so the length of all the shelves has to
be together 12 meters
consumes everything to produce
so t plus m plus b has to be 12 meters
these are the lengths of each of the shelves
and she uses a total of 12 meters of boards
so the sum of the plank lengths has to give 12 meters
so what can we do about it
no we can express everything depending on one variable
we express that depending on m and then subtract them
t-to-m dependency we already have expressed
we can replace all t in the equations
relation m minus 12
but here b is dependent on t
how it can express it depending on m
well we know t is equal to m minus 12
replace all t variables
with this expression
t is equal to
we can rewrite the blue equation as the length of the bottom
shelves are 2 times longer than the length of the top shelf
and we know that t is equal to m minus 12
and if we simplify it a little bit we get
the bottom shelf is equal to distribute it by two
2 times m is 2m
2 times minus half is minus 1
and all of that minus 12
or we could write it as b is equal to 2 times the length
middle shelf minus 32
is that so
1 is 22 and minus 12 is
minus 32
so now we've expressed everything with m and we can
put everything back
so the top shelf instead of there being t so
we put m minus 12 here
so we put m minus 12 plus the length of the middle
shelf plus length of bottom shelf
so and we've already expressed that with m
that's what we just did
here is the length of the bottom shelf depending on m
so instead of writing b here, let's write 2m minus 32
plus 2m minus 32 and that equals 12
all we did was replace t
we expressed t using m and we expressed b using m
now we add all the members with m and the constants
here we have one m here another and
then we still have 2m here
and they're all positive
so 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4m
so we have 4m
and constant members
here we have minus 12 and then we have minus 32
so minus 12 minus 32 is minus 42 which is
minus 2
so we have 4m minus 2
and of course it still equals 12
on one side of the equation we just want to have
unknown m
let's add plus 2 to both sides and get rid of 2 to
on the left hand side
so if we add 2 on both sides of this equation
that leaves only 4m on the left side and these members
cancels out and that's equal to 14
now we divide both sides by 4 and we get m is equal to
14 over 4 that's 72 meters because we're counting
in meters
now we know but we still miss
how much is t and b
let's do this
let's do t
t is equal to m minus 12
so it equals our m is 72 minus 12 and that's
equal to 62 or 3 meters
we're counting in meters because we know
it's in meters
so the top shelf is 3 meters long
the middle shelf is 72 metres which is the same as 3
and 12 meters
and the bottom shelf is 2 times the top shelf
minus 12
and that's how much
that's 2 by 3 meters that's the length
top shelf minus 12 which is 6
minus 12 or 5 and 12 meters
and we're done
and you can verify that the total is really 12
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 meters and that
means equality is achieved
the top shelf is 12 meters shorter than the middle shelf
the bottom shelf is 12 metres shorter than
double top shelf
and we're done
we already know the shelf lengths that
devon needs to be made
