fill the table with integers so
to write the number 430 five different ways
think about it a little bit
this 4 right over here can be seen as 4 hundreds
so 4 hundreds
and here is 3 in the tens place so 3 tens
that's 4 hundreds and 3 tens
but there's another way to write it
for example, we can only have 3000
we took 100 from a place of hundreds and now
we can put it in place for tens
if you take the 100 and put it in the tens place
100 is 10 tens
now you have 10 tens but before you had 3 tens
therefore you're going to have 13 tens here
maybe it seems a little confusing
don't forget it's 430
this is 300 plus 130
that's still 430
similarly you can also see it as 200 plus 230
230 is the same as 23 tens
in the same way it can be viewed as 100 plus 330
33 tens is 330
it can also be seen as 0 hundreds and 43 tens
43 tens is 430
