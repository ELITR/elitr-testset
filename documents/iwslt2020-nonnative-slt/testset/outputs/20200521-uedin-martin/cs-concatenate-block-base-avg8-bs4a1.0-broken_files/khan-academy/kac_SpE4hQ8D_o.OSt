let's do a few examples
let's see
first example
how much is 15 out of 40
we solve examples with percentages by converting
percentages to the decimal, which we then multiply
the number of which we want to calculate the percentage
so 15 expressed by decimal is zero point 15 hundredths
we've already learned that hopefully in the video on converting percentages to decimal numbers
in the video perhaps
and we just multiply it by 40
so 40 times zero point 15 hundredths
5 times 0 is 0
5 times 4 is twenty
shift down
we write zero
and then 0 times 0 is 0
1 times 4 are 4
and we get six zero zero
we write the decimal point
one two
top decimal point is not so one two and comma
belongs here
so 15 of 40 is equal to zero point 15 hundredths times 40 which is equal to 6 point zero hundredths
this is the same thing as 6
another example
I hope that didn't confuse you too much
now I'm going to try to confuse you
unless you're already confused by the previous example
how much is zero point two tenths of a percent of now invent a number out of seven
many people are inclined to say
oh zero point two tenths of a percent is the same thing as zero point two tenths
if you see it the same way then it's a mistake
because let's realize that it's not zero point two tenths
it's zero point two-tenths of one percent
you can think about it in two ways
we could say that's zero point two over one hundred which is
if you multiply both the numerator and the denominator of ten
the same thing as two over a thousand
or we use the technique of when we move
decimal point two places left
by which if we start with zero point two tenths and we shift
decimal point two places left we get hopla
oh
hop hop
decimal point comes here
so it's zero point two thousandths
that's the key
zero point two tenths of a percent is the same thing as zero point two thousandths
it may tempt you to make this mistake myself out of inattention I make it
but don't be sad if you ever make it
but there's always leftovers when you see together
decimal number and percent
now that we've figured out how to write the percentages
as a decimal we have to multiply by a number
of which the percentages are calculated
so zero point two thousandths times 7
that's pretty simple now
7 times 2 is 14
how many numbers we have
after decimal point
count
one two three
so we have to have three numbers after the decimal point
so zero point two tenths of a percent of 7 is equal to zero point 14 thousandths
you're probably telling yourself it's
really small number
and that's right because zero point two-tenths of a percent if we think about it
is even less than 1
less than one hundredth
and actually when we think about it zero point two-tenths of a percent is one-fifth of a percent
and if we do the math then one fifth of 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
this number is going to be
it's important to check
it's always good to take the test because
when you're working with decimals and percentages
it's very easy to get lost in decimal places
or produce a multiple of ten
so always take the test
now I'll confuse you even more
what if I say what number is four-twenty percent
from what number
many may blurt out
I take 20
which will be zero point twenty hundredths.
and I multiply it four times
and that would be a mistake
because let's think
I said what 20 out of 4 is not
I said 20 of any number is 4
we're going to do a little algebra now
I bet you didn't expect that in the percentage examples
let's say that x is the number being searched for
and the entry says that 20 of x is equal to 4
I think you already recognize it in this form
how do we write 20 decimal
zero point twenty hundredths or zero point two tenths
and we multiply that times x to get 4
20 is the same thing as zero point two tenths
it's the same thing as zero point twenty hundredths but that last zero
we don't need
zero point two tenths times x is equal to four
and there's a simple linear equation
I bet you didn't see that coming
what to do about it
two views are possible
we can just divide both sides of this equation
coefficient for x
so if we divide zero point two-tenths here and zero point two-tenths here
comes out that x is equal to 4 divided by zero point two tenths of
So let's figure out what 4 divided by zero point two tenths is
hopefully we'll have enough room
zero point two tenths goes into four we write the decimal here
we're going to move the decimal over here
one place to the right
we get 2 and even here we have to move the decimal
one place to the right
02 goes into 4 as many times
as 2 to 40
and that's easy
how many times does 2 go into 40
2 is in four 2 times
and zero goes into 2 zero times
2 is at 40 20 times
2 is at 40 20 times
so 4 divided by zero point two tenths is 20
the answer is 4 is 20 out of 20
and it makes sense
there's more ways to think about it
20 is exactly one fifth
and 4 times 5 is 20
it matches
we can do a test to be sure
we find out what 20 out of 20 is
so 20 out of 20 is like zero point two tenths times 20
and if we calculate that we're going to get 4 as well
so we convinced ourselves that the result was correct
let's try another similar example
selecting numbers randomly
need 3 is 9 of how many
again x is equal to the number of which 3 is 9
you don't have to rewrite it like that
so we knew that zero point nine hundredths x zero point nine hundredths x is the same thing
like 9 of x is equal to 3
or x is equal to 3 divided by zero point nine hundredths
divide by decimal
so we write the decimal point
and a few required zeros
they moved the decimal here two places to the right
we have to move it up two places here as well
009 goes into 3 as many times
as 9 to 300
9 goes into 30 three times
3 times 9 is 27
I think I see a pattern here
thirty-three 3 times 9 is 27
30 will repeat
will still be coming out 3
comes out that 3 is 9 of you can also write
333 periodic also we know that 03
is actually one third
so 3 is 9 out of 33 whole and one third
even that is an acceptable answer
often when we process with percentages
we only look for the approximate result
precision is not so important here
but in this case, we're going to be precise
as well as in tests and there
where needed
hopefully it wasn't very fast and you get a percentage calculation
feel good
in examples with percentages is necessary
watch how they're written
if indicated find 10 out of 100
it's easy
we just convert 10 to the decimal number and multiply it by a hundred
but if the assignment is 100 is 10 of how many
we need to be aware that this is a different example
what number is one hundred and ten and if we count it
it will be out of a thousand
maybe I was talking pretty fast when I was counting percentages
but I hope you're not confused
I'll upload you more examples
you might have heard the term libor when people talk about interest rates
or say I'll lend you money a few percentage points above the libor rate
you'll hear the libor rate quoted on some financial news channels
and it's just the average of the interest rates that banks borrow between themselves
and is calculated by the British Bankers' Association
is actually calculated thomson reuters for the British banking association
exists for some comparison of other types of securities and financial transactions
and literally means London interbank offer rate london interbank offered rate
it's in London it's the rate offered between banks
