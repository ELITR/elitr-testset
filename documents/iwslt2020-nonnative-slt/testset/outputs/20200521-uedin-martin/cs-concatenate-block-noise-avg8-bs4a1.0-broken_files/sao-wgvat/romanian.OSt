Do you have any other questions?
If not, I would like to ask the floor of our Romanian colleagues.
Okay, good day.
Can you all hear me right?
Yes?
So we have had 19 percent VAT in Romania for two years.
And although there were plans to cut to eighteen per cent, they were put on hold for the time being.
In addition, we have two reduced VAT rates, nine per cent and five per cent.
There have been several changes over the past year in terms of products that may have a reduced rate.
The biggest change, that is, the sewer service, where the rate was cut from nineteen per cent to nine per cent starting on the first of January of this year.
Other items remain unchanged.
By contrast, there have been many changes to the 5 per cent rate, mainly for some products that were at 9 per cent and have now been reclassified to 5 per cent.
The biggest change was most recently on 1 June this year; this change concerned high-quality food and mountain products, as well as traditional products.
And for products made in the mountains, the cows or sheep that produce them must live there for at least half of their lives.
The producer must get them a licence, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
He will then be able to apply a reduced rate.
Then there is the reverse charge mechanism.
In Romania, both companies must be registered in order to use the system.
There are fourteen products for which this can be shortened, and in December two thousand and eighteen had to be for some of which the deadline is extended until twenty-two.
Finally, the Value Added Tax distribution system, which was introduced in the year two thousand and seventeen, although it now looks as if the Treasury has somewhat forgotten it.
For in the year two thousand and seventeen it began with more than four hundred companies, and now in the year two thousand and nineteen their number has fallen to forty-six per cent.
In addition, in the year two thousand and eighteen, no new companies started using the system.
So all the companies that started with it have since started to go back from this system to the normal VAT system.
In addition, the European Commission has ordered Romania to stop using the system.
It therefore appears that the system has not fulfilled what was expected of it, so the ministry is likely to stop using it altogether.
Completely?
I am based on the data available to us because no new companies were registered in the year two thousand eighteen or the year two thousand nineteen.
So there are only companies in the system that started in the year two thousand and seventeen, and their numbers are slowly decreasing.
As far as all these findings are concerned, there are still some regulatory gaps as regards the MOSS system, which in Romania is for some reason referred to as M1SS because it has been translated.
But that's the way it is.
In addition, we lack IT systems at financial offices that can work together and exchange data with each other.
Which will not make things any easier for companies, and last year we finally introduced an electronic system like the one they have in Belgium.
They have put in place electronic cash registers and companies are now obliged to start using them, so the tax authorities are checking that all companies have them installed.
For the moment, however, we are not sure whether the system is fully operational due to the limits in the IT system of financial authorities.
And so far, no new trends have been identified.
So, that would be all.
Thank you.
