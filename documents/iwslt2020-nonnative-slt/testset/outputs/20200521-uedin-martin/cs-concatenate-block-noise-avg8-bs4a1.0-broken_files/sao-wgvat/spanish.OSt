Okay, so we did this audit.
The audit report will be published on 16 July.
Therefore, keep this information secret.
They are under an information embargo until the date of publication.
We await the Commission's response in all 23 official EU languages.
Because we only have an answer in English, so it's just a formality and the audit is now behind us.
The title was 'Many Challenges...' and the special report will read 'There are many challenges remaining in collecting VAT on customs duties'.
That remains to be resolved.
This was originally meant to be "There will be a need to look at" but some have already been addressed to some extent through new legislation, a new Commission proposal that just mentioned <CENSORED>.
But there are still problems that remain to be solved, and we will see about that later.
So I'll start with why we chose this audit topic.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
And we will conclude with our recommendations.
First, ok, we did a survey because we follow up on previous research analyses.
Based on the findings of the head of these institutions in the field of e-commerce, German colleagues, Lithuanian colleagues carried out audits.
Also, in the previous decision we made on imports, we analyse the issue of distance from non-EU countries and the related issues relating to VAT and customs duties and decided that it was worth going deeper during this audit.
The problem is that honest traders are often excluded from the market by dishonest traders and can no longer compete.
This is a problem that has also been raised by representatives of the academic community, such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and is particularly intense in the UK.
Loss estimates, too.
There are only estimates of distances from outside the EU.
However, these estimates are not very encouraging, because even though the commission estimates only five billion a year, in the UK it is between £1 billion and £1.5 billion a year.
This is how they estimated the losses.
This represents an 8 to 10% reduction in UK VAT.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently only accounts for four per cent.
So the triple of the fight against fraud in the UK is the volume of losses in e-commerce of goods bought from third countries.
This is the mission.
We are not counting distance sales within the EU, we are not counting most electronic services.
So the bottom line is to highlight our concerns.
Then what we are focusing on is visiting five Member States - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we took into account the number of registrations to the MOS both in non-EU and US programmes.
Also the volume of electronic sales within the EU and, finally, the estimated amount of VAT lost as a result of the VAT exemption on imports of negligible goods (LVCR).
Following a study by our source at the commission, we also visited the commission.
These steps should debug the technology and the World Customs Organisation, and the cancellation period lasted from 2015 to the end of 2018.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal submitted and all the proposals that will come into force in 2021.
What are we focusing on?
We have, of course, begun to analyse the responses to our survey, a survey sent by the main group of two.
We continue with a questionnaire in all the Member States we have visited with interviews with all sorts of people.
We have gained access, and what is also very important, we have set up access to ABC data to the Synergia database, i.e. the database of incidents, problems that Member States report in the MOS.
We have been given access to all fiscali (fiscal) and e-commerce related project groups and to all BUT related project groups, where there is a lot of information and discussion about the functioning of the MOS.
And, of course, we got funding from the support of institutions from Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and we ended up doing our own samples of different transactions.
Overall, we have put together almost nine hundred e-commerce-related transactions.
What we find, of course, were first positive things and then we'll continue with the most negative.
The regulatory framework is governed by the best international practices at the extremes of the OECD and the World Customs Organisation.
In most respects relating to the OECD, the principle of taxation at the place of destination has been respected in most cases, with the exception of this principle.
There is now a new threshold of under ten thousand euros that you can lodge in the Member State of origin, so it is not in line with the OECD.
In the case of the World Customs Organisation, which deals with imported packages, the Instant Release Guidelines have been followed in most respects, as well as a new proposal within the standards.
The Commission is a pioneer in this area and in most respects is adapting to the World Customs Organisation and standards.
As for the new provision, which will come into force in 2021...
I am trying to resolve some weaknesses, but for us the main problem that will continue to occur is undervaluation.
Losses from VAT and customs duties are experience and will continue to be.
And this cannot be addressed by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As for trade with non-EU countries, this will not be resolved and we will also see why later.
Why yes, because administrative cooperation agreements with third countries do not work.
We have a new agreement with Norway.
We expect a change of information with Norway that it will work, but that is not a problem.
It's not Norway, the problem is China, it's the United States of America.
The information chain with China doesn't work because the Chinese counterpart doesn't respond and the response rate goes down and down and down, so that's the problem.
If we have information about a change of supplier that doesn't work using the electronic interface, i.e. works directly on its website that didn't register in the MOS or even registered and after we cancel the registration, he opens a new website...
So, how come we pay VAT from Europe to China, and we expect VAT to go back to the EU.
Unless we also have the cooperation of the administration.
That will never happen.
This is also a problem among EU countries, it does not work as expected.
Also administrative cooperation, so we will see later that the checks carried out by national tax authorities are weak.
Because there are virtually no tools to carry out a proper analysis of the risk of chance that we have already mentioned.
It will therefore be necessary for a Member State to approve the Commission's proposal to amend the information, with payment service providers subject to scrutiny by the Commission being inadequate.
And we'll see later, of course, that the commission did not carry out any monitoring, any monitoring on that.
There are weaknesses in the check-in's own electronic systems.
The traditional problem, of course, is that traders undervalued goods to be below the euro threshold of twenty-two or ten years for VAT.
And that will disappear in the future, but they will continue to undervalue to pay less VAT.
It will not be approved, but they will pay less and as far as customs duties are concerned, the presumption is set at a hundred and fifty euros and they cannot cope.
Because in all electronic ... we will see the EU electronic clearing system later, they cannot stop the declaration.
Because they tick the box they own electronically, which they apply to the customer electronically for relief purposes.
And they pushed the system, even though they declared a value that was above a hundred and fifty.
The electronic system can't stop it, they said it was something very serious because the operators who work there are promising economic operators.
So, the big couriers have the authority of the Economic Operators Association and claim to be the most reliable, but they are abusing the system.
Promoting the collection of customs duties for VAT is not effective.
Ok, provisions on the chain of information on the recovery of claims related to this tax.
They were rarely used, out of the five Member States we visited, only in Austria.
Only in five cases, so it's not often used.
We are analysing the discrepancy of payments between Member States.
We have access to the harmonisation carried out by the commission and there are still omitted combinations.
Important means a lot between Member States.
In the Netherlands, of course, the problem is that they cannot harmonise, which explains the amounts of VAT received with the VAT return.
And there are also problems with the reminders that even our colleagues from the SAO yesterday...
They anticipated a problem with Member States' comments on consumption, which are not ...
Here is a summary of our findings regarding MOS samples.
We have come to the conclusion that MOS IT infrastructure is fit for purpose, so it is strong.
It can be done by the user, so the IT infrastructure is solid, but there are registration and payment problems between Member States.
For example, when it comes to the analysis of the occurrence reported in Synergy, the Synergy database between Member States, but there are only a few twenty-two cases in five Member States.
Which we reviewed in which Member State with already the origin of the problem and as an influencing Member State.
There were only 12 cases, so there weren't that many cases, the problem is that the attitude of the Member States was really passive.
It wasn't until the problems escalated that they started working on it, but it takes a long time to solve the problems.
As for MOS, it takes long periods, but there are not many problems.
Also, in terms of technical error messages sent and received between Member States, the response is also very passive, not proactive only when the problem escalates as an incident to which they begin to respond.
But this infrastructure for MOS is robust.
We have assessed whether they are ready for a single point of contact.
This is something else. We have received several complaints, especially from Austria.
They say they won't be ready, even from a Dutch trip that we haven't analysed, because the system is being developed especially to order using a one-stop shop for import.
The registration issues are here.
We need to differentiate within the system outside the US and the EU system, only eighty per cent of registrations have not been properly checked.
As for the known system outside the US and we even found it, we found cases of double registration, which is something serious, then in terms of payments, the problem is particularly the problem of missing reminders in the Member State of consumption.
And sometimes by the Member State of identification.
And problems with registration and deregistration.
This is the most related administrative cooperation, it is an exchange of information between the Member States we have visited.
And here we compare with the overall activity of the information chains that we see, for example, there are total information requirements that have been sent to one hundred and eighty-two compared to total information requirements.
It is generally unrelated to the normal nine thousand two hundred, so even in the UK many of them will not be more problematic, for example three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is good, it is very low, and also some Member States have not changed, which is not why we recommend separating the centralised CNO home office.
A separate structure designed for e-commerce, or at least for MOS, so the level of information transfer is very weak.
Then we have multilateral controls, in two cases there were six cases of multilateral controls.
It was a really successful experience.
However, in two cases this was not successful at all as the Member State of identification refused to participate in the multilateral control.
This is something that should be resolved by enforcing the new legislation, because now two Member States can ask to carry out a check.
And another is the recent request that the other Member State of identification cannot refuse such participation.
So hopefully it will improve, but there are other significant things for Eurofisc.
There were four hundred and eighty signals, the chain through Eurofisc works for e-commerce a full five, and only one feedback regarding these four hundred and eighty.
So the Member State didn't find this information very useful, they don't know why only five Member States were chosen, they put seniors in the database.
And others didn't read it because they didn't find the information very useful.
So there are also a few signals about trends or themes of fraud, three or four themes that they find useful.
And then there are the changing tools for web crawling, but that's something that some members are taking over legally in their country.
In other Member States, internal legislation prevents them from using web crawling tools.
Now the work file is frozen and the frozen activities are not useful.
They are waiting for a proposal for an information chain between the payment service provider.
Because they will be, they will be databases and they will have access.
This is the Commission's proposal for all information provided by the payment service provider to any other country, the Commission's proposal.
Of course we are very supportive and put the proposal in the report, but I didn't know until I asked yesterday that the Commission needed some support for this proposal too, because Lubik Lubis said there were problems.
However, I took this for granted in the council because this proposal comes from some discussion in some forums with the Member States and with stakeholders.
Hopefully... this is very important because another problem is the lack of controls, audits for the IOC.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here that it's nobody, because it's never how can I, if not, I don't know that I don't have an analysis of data areas.
So my audit is going to be a random selection with maybe a lot of information and no records, so they're going to need some data and this is the data.
In addition, the company will have many more applications.
Yeah, they seem to understand about Germany because we have the data.
A team outside the U.S., but information he may have.
Phenomenon.
But I don't know further, beyond that there is virtually no control.
Controls on knowledge of intra-EU distances have also not been very successful.
The customs office therefore has the results of a sample from a courier for abuse of postal services.
At the post office, the main problem in dealing with the issue of undervaluation is you have drones very expensive drones declared under ten units or under twenty-two euros.
Samples like this are a thousand times as simple.
And they can read, and it's very difficult to handle at post office level.
And for a courier, they abuse the usual relief of a hundred and fifty, because they just tick the box to take over and fifty can't close then.
A statement to stop the declaration, even if a devaluation of more than a hundred and fifty, we check that not only in the sample, but also directly in the custom electronic system in the dam environment, where we have done several experiments.
Member States did not work in any Member State, only in Austria did it work.
But he didn't receive it in Austria.
We have made another declaration on alcohol.
And then for alcohol, it was enforced, and because that categorization is applicable to alcoholic products.
So there are some flaws in the Austrian system.
This problem is therefore an approved economic operator exploited by the most reliable custom traders.
We also have a recommendation for the Commission to use the structures provided in mutual assistance treaties with non-EU countries.
To solve these problems, solve the problems, find out the lack of answers.
Also inspect Member States' checks at local level on relief.
At a minimum, monitor the functioning of distance selling within the EU, mixed goods this recommendation is the only one not adopted by the Commission.
That's why they laughed yesterday, because your job is
Monitor the commission and <CENSORED 22:25> said: "Yes, yes, yes."
I laughed, but okay.
They help the Member State develop a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for newcomers.
Because this is a problem, we can't know whether the system works or not.
Most schemes are expected to be successful, but this is usually an assumption, which is why we have an estimate of the largest VAT gap.
We do not know whether the system is successful and we have no estimate for the European Union itself, so that would be very important.
As the Commission assists Member States in their development, this is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative solutions.
There could perhaps be assistance in the form of an alternative payment distribution system to tackle VAT fraud.
Using blockchain technology, pathways are proposed, KPMG, KPMG, as well as Professor E. Ensworth's proposal.
There are some very interesting proposals that we have discussed with the commission, of course, and the commission says that they are theoretical, practically coming up with solutions.
In fact, they have not found a practical application, Professor Lamas has also put forward several proposals to use the technology for imports from outside the EU.
But this system is accepted by many other countries.
There's no practical experience, but I think, we think it's also worth going deeper with blockchain technology offering opportunities.
This is something that is also being examined by the committee for the management of the database of important convenience stores.
Numbers to manage the validity of these numbers.
It is very important who that is, the future, the only way to deal with the use of the name of the new technology for the Member States.
We like, of course, that they are starting to respond to fraudulent seniors and are adjusting Eurofisc.
Also follow the compromise in line with the new €10,000 threshold.
This is something that Czech colleagues have highlighted in their report.
And we also took that into account for the reason they explained earlier.
To have a separate MOS and a long-distance coordination function with colleagues, we need to ensure that the trader can introduce a VAT rate, the right VAT rate in MOS VAT returns.
Because when a trader introduces a bad VAT rate, they only receive advice, but the return can be sent the same way, so they receive advice, but it will still be sent.
Also, do the necessary post-registration checks at MOS to avoid this double registration problem.
Increase audit work for most MOS traders and distance sellers with administrative cooperation tools.
Employee of regular VAT estimates in e-commerce.
So if for this recommendation to the Member States, we would be very grateful if you would remember in your home country the importance of adhering to our recommendations.
That is why we are seeking your cooperation on this matter, and that is all we know if you have any questions.
