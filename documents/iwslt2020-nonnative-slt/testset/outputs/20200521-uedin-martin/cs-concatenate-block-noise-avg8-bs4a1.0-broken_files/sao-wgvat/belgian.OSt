So we would like to continue, and I kindly ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to make its presentation.
Okay, I hereby present our current status.
We have two national laws to make European regulation two directives.
One is about paper and digital publications.
Now they have the same rate.
And under certain circumstances, it's a zero rate, but under other circumstances it's six percent.
In the case of letting properties, we have accepted ...the possibility of letting properties ... ... and the mandatory VAT on short-term letting of properties.
Then we did two audits.
One relates to ... , which we have heard several times before, so I will be very brief about it.
The second concerns the system of cash registers.
And then we also have two new four trends.
So our audit on MOS... is not yet complete and is not even published.
Therefore, all the conclusions and recommendations are only preliminary.
But we are almost certain that there will be no more major changes.
Hmmm.
Our conclusions are essentially the same as what we have already heard here today.
But as far as we are concerned, I will just point out some things that are different, but which I think are more or less specific to Belgium.
We currently have only a limited number of staff in the administration because we are more or less a beneficiary, unlike MSID, which transfers money, and we depend heavily on the other Member States.
But in the future, when MOS will expand the most, more staff will be needed.
And they should now be trained and known in advance.
Another general conclusion that we have reached, but which has also been said here, is that there have been changes in control strategies.
What needs to happen is a new direction of thought.
But our administration strongly believes in more MSID, because when we look at conclusions like MSCON...
Just jump from one to the other.
So we see that there is a very poor control strategy.
That is why we strongly believe that every MSID will send or transfer the money.
That's up to us.
However, we have highlighted the importance of making some progress on the control strategy by creating risk profiles.
Our administration has not yet been able to create good risk profiles because they don't have enough data, but they think they will in the future.
I have more data in the future and I could create some risk profiles, so in the future we will monitor whether the control policy will be better.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We track other taxpayers online, so there's a system to find taxpayers online.
But for now, the results are rather bad.
There aren't many things about taxpayers that can be traced.
Then we see that...
The MSIDD registration process is fine as such, but in circumstances where taxpayers are logged out...
There are no follow-up actions if they file a confession in the normal system.
So there is no link or any follow-up system, which we believe is important.
Then we have ... in the process of filing a confession.
There are some automatic checks, which we find very interesting.
So it's not a real check on completeness and correctness (yes, thank you) completeness and correctness.
But it still helps when common mistakes occur.
So the actual checks have to be done by MSCON, but like MSID, but Belgium still helps fill in the returns, so there are some errors.
There will be an alert on the system, or if you have to make a selection and all options are limited, just click on the possible options so there will be fewer errors.
As MSCON, we also found out that they work in Benelux.
So, together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they have created a matrix of certain risks and are developing new control activities.
In the function of these risks and there are already two test sets that have started so far.
We therefore recommend working further in this small group to make progress and disseminate knowledge to European forums.
I think it's about the differences we've had as opposed to what we haven't heard before.
So we're going to do a second audit.
An audit of the cash registers system was carried out.
This is not an audit that Luden and I carried out, but that was carried out by other members of the audit cell.
It was also an audit that was slightly wider than just the TV, but I will only present the conclusions and recommendations that are important to the TV.
The audit focused on the effectiveness and efficiency of the control policy.
Installations and applications, so they looked at two problems concerning the system of registration cashiers.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations they have reached are that the regulation is too complex.
So they recommend simplifying because there are too many exceptions in a regulation, a national regulation.
That it was very difficult to establish a particular group solely on the basis of the statement itself.
And so it was very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that had to install a system of filing cabinets.
Another big conclusion was the control policy.
There are problems with the taxpayer-taxpayer selection of the cash registers system.
When there was a limit, there is a limit. And if the confession is too low, then you fall just below that limit and there is no control anymore, so this was a way to escape the legislation.
There was also a problem with cross-checks of information data from taxpayer collection databases for their control.
Another conclusion was that there were poor internal controls even for the application of the system.
As for the fines that were issued, they found that different control units gave different fines.
There were therefore no rules on fines, but some were very strict and other control teams were not strict at all, or had fines much lower than the rates they gave for certain errors, also risk analysis and an online approach.
It would be an advantage, but it is not implemented now, so the risk analysis was very simple and there is no online access, but once we learned that this kind of system exists in other countries when they have online access.
They found it could be a very good advantage.
Afterwards, there was also an exchange of information with the national social security office, which was not very good.
So a lot of information didn't get from one to the other.
Finally, about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with entering transactions.
The system as such works very well when used, when used, as it should be used, but when certain transactions were not entered into the system they could not be discovered.
So the solution could be to create a media campaign so that customers can apply for a ticket.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise it will not be a ticket or that the legislation would be adapted to accepting only electronic payments, because then it would be easier to track money.
But there is no reliable measurement of impact management as a real impact, so they have no idea.
Our team then ran some tests and tried to find an impact, but they found that there was an expectation effect because the system was delayed for several years.
But everyone knew it was coming, so customers and companies were already anticipating legislation that was about to make a change and introduce the system.
The exact differences between VAT receipts before 2016, when the system was introduced and after, were therefore very difficult to trace.
Because already a couple of years before 2016, VAT returns were being scaled up in light of a new system that would be subject to change.
Our team wasn't sure of the effect.
It's just this system or that the effect was even greater because it started earlier than they thought.
Look, I can interrupt, I just, I have a problem, or I'd like to get it right.
What should I think of as a system of cash registers?
Does that mean this cash system is registered somewhere in the database?
No, it's not, it's online, it's a cash register, yeah "casa."
Oh, okay, so it's just for cafes, hotels and restaurants.
It's just for a certain industry.
So far it's only in the Horeca sector and it's a system that registers every transaction or should register every projection that's put into the system.
(So) There is no online access.
That's why the selection of the control group is so important, because the control teams have to go to different places.
They can't focus on it online on a computer, they have to go to HoReCa and connect their computer to the cash register.
To extract data from it and do a check.
Yes, but they can't do it remotely.
They must always drive themselves to the establishment.
So that's when the confession is too low and it's under the limit.
Teams won't go there to see if they know the cafe, for example, and they know there are a lot of customers and they're not there, but that's just a coincidence.
But that's something they didn't find out until later, so it's going to be them.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was afraid I was the only one who didn't understand.
Okay, but then what's the difference between this system that you're talking about registering a cash register at any retailer, I mean in groceries?
So what's so special about this particular system is that you're there.
There's special software that offers any possibility of system fraud, and it's also software that makes sure the data is transferable to the computer of the control teams.
While you can't extract data in the same way with a regular cash register system.
So it's the registry cashier systems that they have.
Yes, they're also special, but there are, I think, five different stamps of registry cashier systems out there that you can choose from and have certification.
That all data that can be extracted in data formats is suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yeah, yes, so compatibility is certified, which is the main domain of different sections.
Yes, you mentioned this risk analysis, that there is no risk service analysis, or they have not all been done or.
I mean online access to this analysis or?
Online access to your own registration cashier system.
Okay, so which ones could checks are much easier, okay, and because we can do automatic checks or data extraction.
Which could be put into a larger system and the risk analysis was actually very basic because they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or system was only introduced in 2016, so they only had two years of data.
Okay, in conclusion.
I have here two new fraudulent trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called the Matrimony and consisted of registering a large number of foreign companies.
But always by the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulgarian.
But they did register for names that were very similar to familiar names.
There was a difference in only one letter, just so that it could be plausibly assumed that these companies existed, but most of them didn't exist at all.
And then they only filed a VAT return and asked for a VAT refund with fake invoices, but they always did that return in writing and for very small amounts.
Which means the administration had to input all the information into the system, which took time.
Therefore, some refunds had already been made before they could actually establish that there was a possibility of fraud and could check whether the company actually existed and whether those invoices were real.
However, this kind of fraud has been discovered and information about it is already being disseminated through Eurofisc, so I think every tax administration is already aware of this kind of fraud.
Another scam consisted of green energy certificates, which were very similar to earlier certificates for CO3-2.
The fraudulent scheme was more or less the same in that they sent invoices.
Or they used invoices from a firm that looked a lot like a law firm that was otherwise supposed to send invoices.
So we had a scam plan, I shortened it a lot, and I have no picture of it.
But let me put it this way.
There was Company A in Member State X, which according to certificates from B in another Member State A, and sold those certificates to Company C.
Again another Member State Z sent this company an invoice from the corresponding A with a comma...
So that's the name of the company, which differs only one letter from the original.
So Company C wouldn't have seen that fraud was actually taking place.
And of course Company A and Company A with a comma were the same managers who have that Company A, and A with a comma would be the missing trader.
I hope this kind of deception is clear.
And that was the end of my presentation.
