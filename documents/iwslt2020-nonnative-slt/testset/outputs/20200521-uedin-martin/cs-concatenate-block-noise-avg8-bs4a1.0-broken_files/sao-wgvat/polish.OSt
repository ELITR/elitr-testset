If you please.
I would like to ask our Polish colleagues to give their presentation.
Thank you.
And, just to refresh my memory, I would like to say a few words about the new regulations and new instruments that were introduced last year and during this year.
We introduced you to some of them at our plenary session in Warsaw last year.
So those of you who were in Warsaw should know something about it.
So I would briefly remind you of some of them and then I will tell you about our previous audit in this area and our conclusions.
First of all, I would like to mention the single set of audits.
We started implementing these instruments three years ago.
However, last year was the last phase, as the first phase consisted of making the single audit file obligatorily available to the tax authorities upon request.
And now it's an automatic system.
Information must be submitted electronically without any request.
And since July 1 of last year,
This is mandatory for all types of economic operators.
Since 2016.
This was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, smaller and now for all businesses.
I will also come back to that, because we consider this to be crucial in the fight against VAT cuts.
The second piece of legislation I would like to mention is the so-called 'Fuel Package' and, even in this case, the rule has been introduced gradually.
It depends on the type of business and its main idea is that fuel trading licences are only granted to companies having their registered office in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign companies are declared for VAT, in their countries, the same types of companies can benefit from their procedures for suspending excise duty that respect intra-Community purchases of fuel, and VAT incurred as a result of intra-Community purchases of fuel will have to be paid immediately after dispatch of the goods to Poland or after the suspension of excise duty procedure has been completed.
Another regulation is the transport package.
It must be said that the draft of this law is based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this type was introduced in Hungary and in Poland we introduced this system of tracking the transport of goods only for certain types of certain categories of goods.
Generally, they are goods on which excise duty is levied.
I am referring to fuel, tobacco and some others, and by monitoring I am referring to monitoring how these goods are transported by road or rail.
This means that every single transport has to be reported before the start of transport, in a special system, a dedicated system and, since last year, every transport has also been linked to a geo-location system.
So for each individual truck, you can determine where it is right now.
Roads, car parks, etc.
And the Finance Minister for the Treasury, which is analysing the whole big data system that has been delivered online, some of the public institutions, and so as we know, there may be many results and for many there may be some inconsistencies, and many may have found a business entity providing them with this transport in a way that is abnormal in terms of routes, time, etc.
And we plan to audit the Treasury this year.
How is the Treasury prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is in place in the sense that all these companies have to register all traffic and the system is ready in the sense of analysis that is done online.
However, we do not yet know whether the Finance Minister will use this information for any actions carried out by the Financial Authorities.
Another piece of legislation is somewhat similar to what our colleague, who specialises in technical issues, presented yesterday.
So we have a certain blacklist, but in Poland the term blacklist means the list of entities that have been removed from the VAT register.
And we have an information-based system, relaunched by online banks and other financial system entities.
This system can be used by the Minister of Finance to identify any discrepancies and problems, and this system is aimed at capturing unusual transactions and providing financial authorities with information about them online.
And based on that information, the IRS can block an account, a bank account and a specific transaction.
What is the risk that some higher fine than, say, â‚¬10,000 will be enforced?
Another piece of legislation is the distribution of payments, which was introduced last year.
It's optional at the moment.
But it really depends on the buyer.
If one contractor uses it, then the method of payment is obligatory for the contractor, of course.
Importantly, if this payment distribution mechanism is used, then joint and several liability of the taxpayer is excluded.
I'll show you some numbers and in a little while I'll tell you about how this distribution can be used in the payment mechanism.
Finally, here is one legislative and organisational tool that was presented in some detail last year by our colleague from the Treasury.
So we have a new national revenue administration here, based on the previous free administration, and now we have another administration fighting tax and customs in one system.
On top of that, an online registration system.
Ha ha ha.
At the moment, we have a mandatory type of registration cashier system and the mandatory element of these registration cashiers is electronic memory.
The Financial Conduct Authority is therefore able to verify authorised types of registration cash registers based on memory, but we are starting with an online system registration system for only some sectors.
These are first and foremost legal services, medical services, only some specific sectors.
The implication is that we need to start working towards a central system, headed by the head of the national revenue administration.
In this system, all such transactions should be immediately and simply registered online.
And that is why we are embarking on this discussion, so that we can introduce any distribution of payments for all taxpayers affected.
This effectively means that we would like the tax authorities to wish to replace the reverse charge with this payment and reverse charge mechanism and joint and several liability.
Thus, in all sectors where the devolved tax liability or joint and several liability is binding, all these sectors could be covered by this payment distribution mechanism.
Now, as I said before, let me tell you something about our audit.
We did the audit last year.
The period for which the audit was carried out was quite long - it was 12 years, which is why we were asked by the Public Finance Committee of the same Polish Chamber of Parliament to carry out such an audit.
We have come to the following conclusions.
We have had to state that the efficiency of the Treasury's work has been highly volatile over this long period.
Between 2010 and 2015, the Ministry and the tax authorities, in our opinion, made somewhat inadequate efforts to improve their efficiency in the field of VAT revenue.
As the subject of the audit was the Treasury's supervision of tax revenue, or the collection of taxes, specifically the collection of VAT, this is where it manifested itself.
One of the signs of this said volatility in labor efficiency is
so-called VAT GAP.
And during those years, VAT GAP in Poland averaged 24 percent, which was about ten points higher than the median EU country.
Among other things, we concluded that the oversight had not been effectively contacted.
So that's it.
It can be stated that we have information about the VAT GAP in Poland and EU countries and that we have numbers from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And as you can see, the average VAT GAP differential in Europe is certainly lower than in Poland; even if we don't take into account the source of the information, the figures are quite clear.
Mmmm.
I have already spoken about the fact that our main tool and the main tool of financial authorities, as well as the idea that was being put into practice during this period, was a single set of audits, and over the last two years financial authorities have acquired the competence to use databases to analyse them .
For example, in 2017, four million invoices were automatically analysed, but only 3,300 alerts were issued based on these analyses.
Last year, the number of invoices subjected to analysis did not increase much - it was about five million, but the analysis yielded more than 350,000 warnings.
This was reflected in the revenue, as the first stage is automatic analysis and then comes a warning sent via text or email.
So without any official action in the tax proceedings, etc.
And this system, or its first phase, the automatic phase, has brought us additional revenue, VAT receipts worth more than EUR 150 million a year.
I am talking about the figures for 2017 and 2018.
It should be noted that the revenue increase occurred in good economic conditions and the improvement of VAT collection, which was the result of a large package of legislative and organisational changes introduced in recent years.
Yet we are of the opinion that one of the main sources of these results, these financial results, is precisely the introduction of this single set of audits.
As a result of another instrument, this payment distribution mechanism in 2018 was followed by the use of a payment distribution mechanism which, as I have already said, was optional.
However, we observe an increased interest in making payments in this way.
In July last year, taxpayers carried out 600,000 transactions.
In December, more than one and a half million transactions were made using the split payment mechanism.
The value of the tax paid through this split payment mechanism in July was half a billion euros.
And half a billion euros as of December 1.
In total, over seven million transactions were carried out by taxpayers using the payment allocation mechanism between July and December last year, and the amount of tax on special VAT accounts amounted to around six billion euros.
And one more thing about the work of the tax authorities, last year the tax authorities and the ministry carried out 30 percent fewer checks than in 2017, but with fewer checks, the percentage of checks found to be irregular increased.
In our view, this is the result of new electronic tools in place which have helped to better select the bodies for which checks should be carried out.
It is clear that the reduction in the number of checks has been achieved by the fact that the reduction in the number of checks has been accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is clearly less painful and time-consuming for taxpayers.
This led to a 100 percent increase in findings last year compared to 2017.
So, in general, we believe that a number of legislative instruments have been put in place over the past couple of years.
Taken together, the results are sufficient.
In doing so, however, we must not forget that this was done in economically favourable conditions.
So it's not entirely possible to determine what portion of that increased revenue was due to which factor.
If this is the result of new organisational and legislative instruments
or if the overall economic situation is responsible.
That's all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions, please ask.
