Nice weather outside...
Yes, it's quite hot.
Well, I think today is a good day to go out for dinner, don't you?
I do, but I don't know with whom, do you know of anyone?
I know this amazing Venetian businessman.
Who's that?
He's standing right in front of you.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'll pick you up at 8 p.m.
I didn't say yes.
In the meantime, where can I pick you up with my Lamborghini?
What do you mean?
Yesterday, my Lambo was sent to me by my company in Italy.
So you're in the shipping business?
Yes, I have a company based in Venice called Idoge, we are in the business of transporting goods around the world.
What's your company called again?
Idoge. We also sell machines to make pasta, Italian pasta.
Oh, that's interesting.
Not only that, we started in 2016, quite recently, but our customers trust us, we are known for our professional approach and we get a truly excellent response and rating from them.
That's why I'm going to invite you to Mario's restaurant tonight so you can taste the pasta made by our machine.
Boy, you're obviously very confident.
That's because I'm proud of what I do.
So you'll be waiting for me at home?
Oh, you've made me so happy, but I've got something else.
Oh, yeah, I'm used to it...
Bye, bye.
I'm sorry...
