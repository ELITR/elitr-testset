Hello!
My name is <NAME> and I represent the Magic World team.
Magic World focuses on organizing social events, especially for children and teens, such as birthday, private and themed celebrations.
Our goal is to become the best-known company hosting such events.
Our mission is to make an ordinary event something spectacular.
Over time, the company's activities have diversified as we take more and more into account the needs and requirements of our customers.
Today we have a wide range for different ages, such as clown parties, fairy tale parties, comic book character parties, magic and karaoke performances and puppet theatre.
We keep up with marketing trends, so we also organize celebrations at home, in nursery and elementary schools and other places according to the customer's wishes.
We offer complete services: face painting, various kinds of balloons and themed decorations for unforgettable celebrations.
Our employees have experience with children and we have been working in this field for a long time.
We believe that our company has a business idea that is profitable because it is future-oriented, has experienced employees who work with enthusiasm, and most importantly, its offer is comprehensive and based on customer needs.
That's why our motto is, "We enjoy entertaining you!"
If you would like to meet my team, my staff and learn more about us, please stop by our booth number seventy-nine.
Thank you so much!
