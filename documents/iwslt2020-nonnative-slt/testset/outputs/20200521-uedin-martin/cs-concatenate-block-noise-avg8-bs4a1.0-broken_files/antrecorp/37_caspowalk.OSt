Hello!
What floor are you going to?
Hello, until the 15th.
And you?
The 22nd.
Do you mind if I take my shoes off?
Those high heels are killing me!
Of course.
I won't mind.
Thank you.
Why do you wear those high heels when you can wear sneakers?
I know a good shop that focuses on selling leisure shoes.
Oh, really?
Yes, I actually work for him.
It is called CaspoWalk Ltd. and we offer different types of footwear from different brands such as Nike, Adidas, for all ages and genders.
Do you also offer any special footwear?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some pairs of shoes.
This month's special offer is Danish-style clogs, and if you like sports, you'd like a brand new pair of Nike boots called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes that you control with your phone.
You can use the mobile app to customise the tying of shoelaces and the colour of LEDs.
If I buy shoes from you, will you offer me some accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer shoelaces and insoles and many other accessories.
Here's my card.
Be sure to stop by our shop.
Okay, thank you.
You can also find us in this building.
We're attending a student business fair.
Thank you so much!
We got to my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
Take care.
Nice to meet you, too.
Take care.
