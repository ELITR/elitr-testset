I'm tired.
The service on the train is so exhausting.
I have to sit down somewhere.
Did I hear right?
Are you looking for a comfortable chair to sit in and relax in?
You're in the right place at the right time, and I'm probably the right person.
Another annoying salesman who wants to offer his products.
Wait, wait... before you get the wrong picture, let me introduce myself.
My name is <NAME> and I'm the director of New Design World.
Our company was founded in 1981 in northeastern Italy by a group of young people who share a passion for furniture.
Our goal is to produce high quality and sophisticated products, available to a wide range of users.
For example, our comfortable chairs are the perfect combination of beauty and elegance.
Oh, interesting.
Sounds like a good offer.
I was just about to upgrade my office, so carry on.
We would like to offer something that focuses on the customer without forgetting the quality, so we would like to offer our sophisticated products.
And, so...
Would you be interested?
Yes, you talked me into it.
Great!
So now that you've planned out the basis of your office, how about a look at our modern shelves and desks?
They are carefully selected, environmentally friendly and the whole production takes place in Italy, as with all our products.
