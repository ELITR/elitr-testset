Hello, do I know you from somewhere?
Hello, I feel like we've met before, maybe we went to the same school a few years ago.
Yes, and you?
Yes, what do you do for a living now?
I'm the director of a small business called Salon NG, which is an animal parlour.
Oh, that sounds very interesting, could you tell me more about him?
Yes, of course.
We focus on caring for dogs, cats, horses and rodents.
We offer services such as cutting claws, cleaning ears or just trimming fur.
But we also offer various products, such as dog bedding, animal clothing and dog food, especially allergen-free, from the Czech company Ontario.
Do you have any pets?
We can provide you with the highest quality care if you're interested.
Yes, I have a dog, I'd like to have his claws cut, they seem too long.
Would you please give me your card?
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot them upstairs, but I'll go get them right away.
Okay, let's go.
