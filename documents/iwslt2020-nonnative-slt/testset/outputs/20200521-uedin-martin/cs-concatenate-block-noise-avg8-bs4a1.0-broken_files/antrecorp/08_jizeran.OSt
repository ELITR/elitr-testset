Hello, I'd like to introduce you to the company Jizeran.
We are from Liberec and we brew beer.
We started out as a small group of friends who just wanted to brew beer, but we soon found that everyone liked it.
We offered it to friends and they liked it, so we started exporting it abroad and cooking it in bulk.
Today we offer four types of beer.
Ten Reichenbier, eleven Reichenbier, Reichenbier thirteen and our special, dark special fifteen.
We offer beer in cans, bottles, barrels and five bottles.
Our beer is from hops from Å½atec.
I'm glad you listened to me, and if you'd like to try our beer, you can visit us at booth number forty-five.
Thank you.
