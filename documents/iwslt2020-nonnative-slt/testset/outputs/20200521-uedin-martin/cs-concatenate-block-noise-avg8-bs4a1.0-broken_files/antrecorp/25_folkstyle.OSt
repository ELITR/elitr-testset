Hello.
My name is <NAME> and I'm from the fictional firm Folkstyle of <CITY>.
I'd like to say a few words to you about our company.
Our company Folkstyle comes from Slovakia and focuses on the production of clothing and fashion accessories decorated with traditional Slovak folklore motifs.
Folklore, as you know, has a very long tradition in Slovakia, which is why we still have rich sources of ideas.
It should be stressed that all our products are hand-embroidered.
In our wide range you will find embroidered dresses, skirts, belts and also bracelets or today's very popular bow ties - I have one just on me, by the way.
For our products, we draw on folk motifs from different regions of Slovakia.
We try to combine these motifs with recent fashion trends to create timeless pieces of clothing that should not be missing from any wardrobe.
We offer products for all ages that will satisfy younger and older customers.
When you order our products, you won't be waiting more than thirty days for the goods.
Payment is possible in cash as well as by bank transfer.
