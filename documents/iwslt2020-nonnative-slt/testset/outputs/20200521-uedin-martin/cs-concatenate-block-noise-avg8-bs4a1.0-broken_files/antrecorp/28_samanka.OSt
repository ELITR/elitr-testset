Hello!
I am from the personnel department of Å amanka, s.r.o., which was established in 2018 in the city of Liberec.
We make soft fruit sodas.
We support local and foreign fruit suppliers.
We are currently selling six flavors worldwide, with one of the flavors being a limited edition.
It's a cotton candy flavor.
If you'd like to try them, you'll find samples in our stand.
We've got booth seven, and I don't think it's open now, but maybe tomorrow.
We should be there.
I'd like to thank you for listening to my company's presentation, and I'd like to wish you all the best of luck and fun at this fair.
