I came here today to introduce to you... I want... I want to introduce my company.
Our company is a limited liability company, but we're not a big company.
Our company has seven employees and three departments.
We have a business department, a finance department, and then a management department.
Now I would like to tell you what our company produces.
Our company makes ads for other companies.
We make stickers for cars, for pencils and for mugs, billboards and more.
We also produce promotional items.
They are, for example, business cards and catalogues.
At the end of my presentation, I'd like to thank you for your attention and invite you to our booth, which is number forty-seven.
Thank you.
