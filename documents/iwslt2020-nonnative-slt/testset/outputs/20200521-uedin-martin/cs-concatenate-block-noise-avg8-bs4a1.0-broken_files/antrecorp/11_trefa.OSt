Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I represent Trefa s.r.o.
We focus on selling sweets and sugary drinks.
One of our best-selling products is liquorice from Morocco from our business partner Mishoc.
Mishoc has a really rich history.
This licorice is one of the best varieties.
It has a long shelf life.
We also buy cookies from them.
These cookies are made from 100 percent chocolate.
We also import goods from Russia.
Russia is one of our biggest partners.
We buy chocolate, cookies and candy from them.
Although some say that Russian chocolate is not as good as Swiss or Belgian, it is also one of the best in the world.
If you'd like to try anything, you'll find us at booth number eight.
You can come and taste whatever you want.
If you want to buy something, then we have a 20 per cent discount on all goods today.
So that is all.
I'm glad you listened to me.
Have a nice day.
