Ladies and gentlemen, my name is <NAME> and I am the director of fictional firm FictionalCine, which operates a cinema, screens films and prepares educational programmes for schools.
Our company was founded in Mělník on September 1, 2018.
Our company has... had five members, but at the moment there are only four.
Every month we prepare new programs and offers for customers.
As a complementary activity, we also offer customers refreshments.
If you are interested in our educational programmes, you can contact us by email at fictionalcine, at the beginning, gmail, dot, com or visit us at booth number fifty-five.
We look forward to meeting you.
Thank you.
