Excuse me!
Good morning.
Can I have a look, please?
Good morning, yes, for sure, there you go.
Thank you.

I work for the "Il Gabbiano" travel agency, would you be interested in a particular trip?
Yes, I'd like to visit a European city, but I don't know which one.
Our offer covers the whole of Europe and I would recommend a cool place like Vienna because I like it. Otherwise I can suggest Barcelona.
Could you tell me how your agency works?
We work in several task-divided groups. They are marketing, client contact departments, ... and they all work together to develop a package deal.
That's great, really interesting.
Do you have a business card so I can call you later for more information?
Yes, I think...
Yes, here it is.
Great.
Thank you so much.
Please.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
