Hello.
Hi.
Oh, that's a very nice shirt.
What brand is that?
Oh, it's not a brand, it's the logo of my hotel.
Really?
You have a hotel?
Yes, of course.
Located on the Vltava River in the heart of České Budějovice, we offer three classes of rooms.
First class is called Goldfish and it includes the most luxurious room in our hotel.
Then we have the second grade, the Silver Fish, and the third grade, which is called the Bronze Fish.
I mean, do you offer any special rooms?
Yes, we do.
We have a special room designed for couples in love to celebrate anniversaries and the like.
I mean, do you have a restaurant...?
Yes, we do.
We have a customer restaurant where the public can come, but our customers eat in it for free.
And if you stay in our restaurant longer than you wanted - well, you know, that can happen - then you can use our fitness centre with the latest equipment.
I mean, I'm sorry, but I don't like fitness, don't you offer massages ...?
Well, if you're not really attracted to fitness, then you can visit our rest centre, where we offer massages, saunas, lava stone massage and more.
Oh, wow, okay, I like that, great!
And if I may add, there's free Wi-Fi access and free guest parking throughout the hotel.
Well, thank you.
I hope you will visit us.
Absolutely.
