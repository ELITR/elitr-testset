Oh, what a busy day!
You're right, really challenging!
Do you think it will be worthwhile for us to attend this fair?
Of course!
You know, I don't lack confidence because we sell fashion and trendy products like bed linen and furniture...
People can't resist buying something from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are made in Italy: everyone knows that this is a guarantee of high quality.
You're absolutely right, but remember: we're here to make contact with new customers.
Can we apply ourselves in these new markets?
Well, you know, our headquarters are in Veneto and that's an advantage: we're so close to those markets, Eastern Europe is just around the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will be expensive!
It will mean a 5% loss in the first year.
Come on, think positive! That five percent will be our third-year profit!
And I'm sure we got new customers today.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, everyone needs a good night's sleep.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, a comfortable mattress and a warm blanket to sleep on?
And it's all handmade by our skilled craftsmen!
What a dream!
Well, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!
