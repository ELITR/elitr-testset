Hello, my name is <NAME>, like the car, and I'm a marketing representative for the International Tour, a tourist agency that sells tourist products in Romania and the rest of Europe.
We manage to satisfy the customers and our team is, I think, the best.
I can say that we participate in many competitions
and we're getting the great results that we're benefiting from today.
This time last year, we took part in an internship, and because I want to make you an offer, I will build on my own experience.
We spent a seven-day holiday in Rimini, Italy, at the three-star Hotel Kursaal, which is located near a sea cliff and has a private beach and rooms with partial sea views. The price is 720 euros for six nights for two people.
I also have a flyer with me that contains three different offers.
One is a stay in Rome, another is a city break and the last is a stay in our city, Bucharest, in our four-star Interbusiness hotel.
Finally, I must add that at this trade fair, customers can benefit from a 10% discount.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you so much.
