Good afternoon.
My name is <NAME> and I represent the fictional Time Travel Agency.
The company was founded in 2014. In 2018, our class took over, rebranded, and the result is that today the company is more focused on historical packages.
There are three leading members and twenty-two students in the eleventh grade on the team.
As I said, we combine the magic of the past with modern trends to meet customer demands.
Each package we offer includes three basic services: transport, accommodation and food, and various other additional services.
For example, a folk art workshop, wine tasting, children's camps, riding and archery courses, night paintball, meetings and conferences.
In a show of respect for the past, Time Travel Agency is donating five percent of the profits to the castles it works with.
You can connect with us in many ways, on Facebook, by email, on Instagram and by post.
Our website is at timetravelsrl.wixsite.com.
Do not hesitate to come and see our stand number sixty-six.
Enjoy a moment with Time Travel Agency!
Thank you for your attention.
