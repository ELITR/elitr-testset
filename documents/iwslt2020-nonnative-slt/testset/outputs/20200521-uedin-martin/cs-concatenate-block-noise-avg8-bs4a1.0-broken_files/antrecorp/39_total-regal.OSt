Hello friends, my name is <NAME> and I'm going to walk you through today's company presentation in which I'm going to introduce the most famous fictional company, straight from Austria, Total Regal.
We have been ruling the market since 1999 and breaking down the dreams of other firms.
In fact, our CEO ran this company before any of you were even born.
Imagine that.
So where does our headquarters reside?
In the mountains, of course.
No, I'm kidding, we actually have other cities than Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirts and short leather pants, no, I'm kidding.
In fact, though, we can pull out the traditional outfits for one of the countless parties we throw when we want to have a beer or something.
Well, okay, more like two beers.
So why should you buy our products?
The most popular of our products, which by the way have already become real icons, we have been selling since 1999, two decades ago.
For example, the Helping Hand, which is a great way to store all kinds of clothes, such as jackets, or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and handbags.
So come and see our shop and as we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
