Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
Our company is called Be Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on May 15, 2017 and was taken over by Ms <NAME> on September 1, 2018.
We sell dresses and suits of Czech designers and tailors workshops.
We care about the quality of materials. Our clothes and suits are made of recycled and natural materials.
We would also like to mention environmental problems in the fashion industry.
The fashion industry contributes most to environmental pollution.
And that is... over a hundred and fifty billion items of clothing are produced, and billions more of clothes are... burned or buried in pits.
By 2030, the fashion industry will grow as the population increases.
The typical cycle of clothing production is as follows: sourcing materials for fabric production, fabric production, fabric weaving, preparation, thus dyeing and printing, and finally sewing and finishing clothes.
Thank you for your attention, we wish you a good day.
