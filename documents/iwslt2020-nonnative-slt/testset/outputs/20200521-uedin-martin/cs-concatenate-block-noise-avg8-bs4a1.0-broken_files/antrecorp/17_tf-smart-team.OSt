Hello, my name is <NAME> and I am the executive director of Smart Team from Maria Teiulen University of Economics in Pite»ôti, Romania.
Our company's intention is to provide agritourism services in the tourist areas of Romania and to promote tourism potential so that we are number one on the market in this area.
After analyzing the market for the 2019 winter season, we have created an offer for you that you can't resist.
We called the package "Discover Dracula's Land."
It offers wonderful experiences in the town of Bran, in Poiana Brasov, where Dracula was born.
We offer you three incredible days during which you can relax, have fun, visit the surroundings, take pictures and get memories of a lifetime.
The first day begins with a visit to the famous Castle Bran, or "Castle of the Vampire Dracula," a place of mystery.
The next day you will enjoy with friends or family a visit to Dino Park, the only dinosaur park in Romania and the largest such park in south-eastern Europe.
Another goal will be to discover one of nature's magnificent creations, the "Canyon of the Seven Stairs," which consists of seven waterfalls, the tallest of which measures thirty-five meters.
On the last day, you will have plenty of time to enjoy twelve slopes, as we will provide you with a free daily pass.
And how better could you end your trip than with a special photo lesson in the Carpathians?
We hope we have piqued your curiosity to find out more about our offer and services, and we can't wait to meet you at our stand number fifty-eight.
