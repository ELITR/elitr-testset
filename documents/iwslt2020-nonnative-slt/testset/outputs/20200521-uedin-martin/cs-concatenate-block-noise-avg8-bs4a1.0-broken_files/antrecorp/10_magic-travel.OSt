Hi!
Hi!
Do you work for a travel agency?
Because I saw your tag.
Yes, I work for a travel agency in Vienna called Magic Travel.
I plan to take a trip with my girlfriend.
We offer romantic excursions, but if you're more of an adventurous couple, we also offer sports and culinary excursions.
We're more like romantics.
We offer trips to Russia, Spain and England.
If you'd like to take a look at our catalogue...
Yes.
I mean, that's interesting.
Which would you recommend?
I would recommend Verona because it's a city of love and I think your girlfriend would really like it.
If you have any further questions, I will give you our business card, according to which you can contact us at any time.
But I have to confess to you, I don't have a girlfriend and I would like to go on a romantic journey with you.
I think we'll meet again at the office.
