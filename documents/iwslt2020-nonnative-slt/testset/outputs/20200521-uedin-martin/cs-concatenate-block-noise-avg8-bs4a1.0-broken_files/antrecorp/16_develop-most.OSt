Hi!
I'd like to introduce you to the company I represent.
Develop Most.
Our company was founded this year but has already won several awards.
So a pretty great future lies ahead.
We offer cloud service and Minecraft.
Cloud service is primarily related to Office 365.
So the real supplier is Microsoft, we just sell the license.
Specifically, we offer three licenses, for household, individuals, companies and one large package under the name E3.
Each of these variants is somewhat different, but all contain basic programs such as Word, Excel or Powerpoint.
And then we have the aforementioned Minecraft.
An open-world construction game suitable for any age.
Perhaps there is no need to introduce it, thanks to its popularity it has gained millions of players around the world.
It should also be mentioned that we offer tailor-made applications.
Based on the customer's requirements, we can produce an app that suits him perfectly.
If you are interested in additional information, I can give you my card.
We will be happy to answer your questions at any time.
