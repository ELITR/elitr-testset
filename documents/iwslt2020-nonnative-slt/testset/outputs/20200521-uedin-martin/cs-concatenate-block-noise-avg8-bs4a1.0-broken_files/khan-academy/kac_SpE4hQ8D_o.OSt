Let's do a few examples.
Let's see.
First example
What's 15 out of 40?
We solve examples with percentages by converting
the percentages to the decimal, which we then multiply
the number from which we want to calculate the percentages
So 15, in decimal terms, is zero-point-15 hundredths.
I hope we learned that in the video about converting percentages to decimals.
In the video, perhaps.
and we're just going to multiply by 40.
So 40 times zero point 15 hundredths.
5 times 0 is 0
5 times 4 is 20.
Scroll Down
Let's write zero.
And then 0 times 0 is 0.
1 times 4 is 4.
And we get six-zero-zero.
Let's write a decimal.
One, two.
There's no decimal at the top, so one, two and a comma.
He belongs here.
So 15 out of 40 is equal to zero point 15 hundredths times 40, which is equal to 6 point zero hundredths.
That's the same thing as 6.
Another example
I hope that didn't confuse you too much.
Now let me try to confuse you a little.
Unless you're already confused by the previous example.
What's zero point two percent from now come up with a number of seven?
Many people are inclined to say
Oh, zero point two percent is the same thing as zero point two tenths.
If you see it the same way, then it's a mistake.
Because let's realize it's not zero point two tenths.
It's zero point two percent.
There are two ways to think about it.
We can say that's zero point two over 100, which is
If you multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10.
Same thing as two over a thousand.
Or we use the technique when we shift.
decimal point two places to the left
which if we start with zero point two tenths and move
The decimal point two places to the left, we get hopped.
Oh.
Hop, hop.
Decimal Comes Here
So it's zero point two thousandths.
That's the key.
zero point two percent is the same as zero point two thousandths.
It may tempt you to make this mistake, I make it out of inattention.
But don't be sad if you ever do.
Always stay sharp when you see them together.
decimal and percentages
Now that we've figured out how to write percentages,
As a decimal number, we have to multiply the number by it.
of which percentage do we count
So zero point two thousandths times 7.
That's pretty simple.
7 times 2 is 14.
How many numbers do we have?
past the decimal point
Let's count.
One, two, three.
So we have to have three numbers behind the decimal point.
So zero point two percent of 7 is equal to zero point 14 thousandths.
I guess you're thinking this is it.
really small number
And that's right, because zero point two percent, if you think about it.
is even less than 1
less than one hundredth
And actually, when we think about it, zero point two percent is one-fifth.
And if we do the math, then one fifth of 7.
Will this be the number?
It's important to check.
It's always good to take a test because
when you're working with decimals and percentages
It's very easy to get lost in decimals.
Or make a multiple of ten.
So always take the test.
Now I'm going to confuse you even more.
What if I say what number is four-twenty percent?
What number?
Many may blurt out
I'll take 20.
Which will be zero point twenty hundredths.
And I'll multiply that by four times.
And that would be a mistake.
Because let's think.
I said what's 20 out of 4, right?
I said 20 out of some number is 4.
We're going to do a little bit of algebra now.
I bet you didn't see that in the examples per cent.
Let's say x is a wanted number.
And the terms say that 20 of x is equal to 4.
I think you recognize it in that form already.
How do we write 20 decimal digits?
zero point twenty hundredths or zero point two tenths
And we multiply that by x to get 4.
20 is the same thing as zero point two tenths
It's the same as zero point twenty hundredths, but that last zero.
We don't.
zero point two tenths times x is equal to four
And there's a simple linear equation.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
What about it?
Two views are possible.
We can just divide both sides of this equation.
coefficient u x
So if we divide zero point by two tenths here and zero point by two tenths here,
x is going to be equal to 4 divided by zero over two tenths.
So let's figure out what 4 is divided by zero point two tenths.
Hopefully we'll have enough room.
zero point two tenths goes into four, let's write a decimal here.
Let's move the decimal here.
One place on the right
We get 2, and even here we have to move the decimal point.
One place on the right
0.2 goes into 4 as many times.
as 2 to 40
And that's easy.
How many times does 2 go into 40?
2 is in four 2 times
And zero goes into 2 zero times.
2 is at 40 20 times
2 is at 40 20 times
So 4 divided by zero point two tenths is 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 out of 20.
And it makes sense.
There are more ways to think about it.
20 is exactly one fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
That's right.
We can do a test just to be sure.
Let's see what 20 out of 20 is.
So 20 out of 20 is like zero point two tenths times 20.
And if we do the math, it comes out as 4.
So we convinced ourselves that the result was correct.
Let's try another example like this.
I pick numbers at random.
Maybe 3 is 9 out of how many.
Again x is equal to the number of which 3 is 9.
You don't have to rewrite it like that.
So we know that zero point nine hundredths x zero point nine hundredths x is the same thing.
As 9 of x is equal to 3.
or x is equal to 3 divided by zero point nine hundredths
dividing by decimal
So let's write a decimal point.
and a few zeroes needed
If we move the decimal here two places to the right.
We've got to move it up two spots here, too.
009 goes into 3 as many times
as 9 to 300
9 goes into 30 three times
3 times 9 is 27.
I think I see a pattern here already.
Thirty-three 3 times 9 is 27.
30 will be repeated.
will still be coming out 3
based on 3 is 9 of you can also write
333 periodic, we also know that 0.3
is actually one third
So 3 is 9 out of 33 whole and one-third.
That, too, is an acceptable answer.
often when we work with percentages
We are only looking for an approximate result.
Precision isn't that important here.
But in this case, we will be precise.
as well as in tests and there
where it's needed
Hopefully it wasn't too fast and you've got a percentage of the calculation.
Feels good.
in examples with percentages is required
Pay attention to how they're written.
If listed, find 10 out of 100.
It's simple.
We just convert 10 to a decimal and multiply it by 100.
But if the entry is 100, it's 10 out of how many.
It has to be realised that this is a different example.
What number is a hundred and ten, and if we do the math?
It'll be a thousand.
I may have been talking fast enough in counting percentages.
But I hope it didn't confuse you.
I'll upload you more examples.
You may have heard the term libor when people talk about interest rates.
Or, they say, I'll lend you money a few percentage points above the libor rate.
You will hear the libor rate quoted on some financial news channels.
And it's just the average of the interest rates that banks borrow between themselves.
and is calculated by the British Banking Association
In fact, a thomson reuters for the British Banking Association is calculated.
exists for some comparison of other types of securities and financial transactions
And it literally means London interbank offer rate, London interbank offered rate.
It's in London, it's the rate offered between banks.
