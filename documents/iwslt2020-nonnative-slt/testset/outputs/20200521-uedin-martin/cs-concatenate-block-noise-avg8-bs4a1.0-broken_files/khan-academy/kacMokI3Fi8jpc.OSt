Shade 109.
Just to recap, if we wanted to break 109 down.
It would literally be 109 percent, which is the same thing.
Like 109 for and now I could write a penny again.
But we already know that.
A cent means 100, literally that.
stands for 109 out of 100.
If we had 100 out of 100, we would have one whole.
But now we have more than a whole.
We have 109 out of 100.
We can write this as a ratio or a fraction.
It's the same thing as 109 divided by 100.
equal to 109 over 100
So let's put it out there.
Here we have a whole we will
Consider this square as a whole
We did the math in the last video.
It's a 10-by-10 square.
is divided into 100 parts
We want to get 109 of these 100 parts.
What will it look like?
It means we're shadowing everyone.
100 parts here.
I'll do it in a new color.
So let's color this whole thing.
If we colored just that, we'd have 100.
It would be 100 divided by 100 or 100 out of 100 or 100.
I think you're getting the hang of it.
I don't want you to just memorize it.
It literally means 100 out of 100, or a whole.
So it's a whole square.
It's 100 out of 100 here.
The question is, color 109.
We've already done 100 out of 100, but we still have to do another 9.
So let's color in another 9.
So now we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
6 7 8 9
This piece right here.
That's exactly it.
It's 9 whole squares.
This is 100 whole squares.
if we take this whole piece and add this blue part to it,
We get 109, one.
whole square
I hope that makes sense.
