London interbank offer rate
To understand this a little better, we have set up two banks here.
Bank and bank and you may already know
that when you go and put your money in the bank
The bank won't keep all that money.
The way he makes money is he lends a good part of the money to other people as loans.
and they're just keeping enough money close at hand
These things, you know, people could actually come in and claim their money from their current account.
We have plenty at hand.
You can imagine that every now and then the bank gets into a situation where it's short of cash.
Or it can get close to mandatory minimum reserves.
that a country's central bank requires a bank to have
In these situations, let's say the bank is putting itself in that situation.
They said, let's go and borrow some money.
We'll go and borrow money from another bank.
This is interbank lending.
The bank is overwhelmed with cash here.
They say we don't want to hold that much cash.
We want to borrow it, we can actually get interest on the cash, we don't get interest.
like bank b will lend money to the bank and
Maybe he'll lend that much cash.
This is the new cash the bank got.
This is where the new cash is.
And of course it's credit.
This is a new loan to make up for it, remember.
that assets equal liabilities plus equity
Commitments are all here.
This is a loan from the bank for this cash.
They have a slightly better reserve.
And now the bank's credit would go up and their cash would go down.
This is a loan, a loan to a bank.
This is where they took this cash and gave it to the bank and
And the rate at which they lent it.
1 annual rate was needed
And of course it renews every day, it's a one-day rate.
This rate is the interbank rate.
What do they do on behalf of the British Banking Association?
They're doing a survey of a number of banks in London.
8, 12, 16 banks in London
They said, hey, at what rate do you all trade?
and determine it
determine this as a one-day libor rate
They determined to say 12 across all the banks from the survey.
But what's interesting about the libor rate is that it's quoted in ten currencies.
It's not just in sterling dollars.
Or it's just in ten currencies.
That's what sets her apart from other things.
But it really sets it apart from the actual federal funds rate, which is another interbank lending rate.
But that's in the US.
and more subject to political pressures
The Federal Bank is actually trying to change that.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, that's a really nice shirt.
What brand is that?
Well, that's not a brand, that's the logo of my hotel.
Oh, really?
Got a hotel?
Yeah, I do.
We are located in the heart of České Budějovice on the Vltava River and have three types of rooms.
