Welcome, let's talk about the Internet.
which is what you're using right now
The internet is a large network of interconnected computers.
and by 2014, more than
billion websites
a whole billion
Not so long ago, it was only a million.
And that was plenty even then.
what we use the site for
They used them at first.
scientists to share their research
Particle accelerator, for example.
But today, everyone uses them, for just about anything.
it is possible to write with your family via social networking sites
Share with others photos
your cute kittens
Tours abroad can be planned on travel portals.
And the news ones.
To find out what's going on again.
and then of course you need to use the site
Khan academy for study
So what's your favorite site?
I actually have a slightly better question for you.
what the page you're missing on the internet should look like
Maybe a page about you.
Or something you like.
The cool thing is, you can program a site like that yourself.
And you can learn it here at the khan academy.
Think about what you want to create first.
Because you'll soon learn how to do it.
But let's get the terminology straight, for starters.
What exactly is the internet?
Like I said, it's a lot.
linked computers to websites
when the computer is connected to the internet and provides a website
We call it the server.
by English server to serve
The website is written in three languages.
html forming the page structure
css then modifies its appearance and javascript page makes it interactive
how users see these pages
We use an internet browsing app to do that.
For example, chrome firefox or internet explorer.
We call these applications browsers.
browsers all try to view the page the same
but they have some differences
That's why we sometimes say
Oops, there's been an error, try using a different browser.
What browser are you using right now?
You have to use that browser on a device.
like on a laptop, a mobile, a tablet, or a smart TV.
We call all of these devices clients.
Clients can be very different.
Some are smaller than others.
Some have touch screens, others keyboards.
Some are black and white.
websites trying to look good
on all different devices
and what device do you use
And that's the internet.
His two-minute version, that is.
There's plenty more we can learn about him.
But I think it's time to start writing some html and css.
and create your own website
