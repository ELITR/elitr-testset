We have a role Devon is going to do 3 shelves for
My father.
It has a piece of board that is 12 metres long.
He wants the top shelf to be half a meter shorter than
middle shelf
I'll do it in different colors.
So he wants the top shelf to be half a meter shorter than
middle shelf
I'll read the whole assignment first.
and the bottom shelf should be half a meter shorter than twice the length
top shelf
Select a different color
I'll do it in blue.
The bottom shelf will be half a metre shorter than double.
Top shelf lengths
how long individual shelves will be if
It uses an entire 12-metre board.
Let's mark variables with different shelf lengths.
Because that's what we have to calculate.
We have a top shelf and a middle shelf.
And the bottom shelf.
So let's say t denotes the length of the top shelf.
t denotes the length of the top shelf
and m will correspond to the length of the middle shelf
M stands for middle shelf.
a b will denote the length of the bottom shelf
b is the bottom shelf
Now let's find out what these different statements tell us.
So the first statement says that Devon wants to have a top shelf.
I use the same color, I want the top.
a shelf half a metre shorter than the middle shelf
So he wants the length of the top shelf to be
half a metre less than the length of the middle shelf
we have all the variables in meters so we can write
Middle shelf length minus
12 meters
This is what the orange underlined sentence tells us.
The top shelf must be 12 metres shorter than the length.
middle shelf
So what does the next statement tell us?
and the bottom shelf must be
12 metres shorter than
double the length of the top shelf
So it's 12 meters less than double that.
Top shelf lengths
These are both statements written down.
using equations
The length of the top shelf is equal to the length of the middle shelf.
Minus 12.
It is 12 metres shorter than the middle shelf.
and the bottom shelf must be 12 metres shorter than
double the length of the top shelf
So how do we solve this?
Well, only with these two equations to solve it.
We can't, but there's more information in the assignment.
We have entered here how long the individual shelves will be if
Devon uses a whole 12-metre board.
So the length of all the shelves has to.
be together 12 meters
It needs everything to produce.
So t plus m plus b has to be 12 meters.
These are the lengths of each of the shelves.
And she uses a total of 12 meters of board.
So the sum of the plank lengths has to be 12 meters.
So what can we do about it?
Well, we can express everything depending on one variable.
We'll express that depending on m and then subtract them.
We already have an addiction to it.
We can replace all those in the equations.
Relationship with minus 12.
But here b is dependent on t
how it can express it depending on m
Well, we know that t is equal to m minus 12.
we replace all the variables t
with this expression
That's equal.
We can rewrite the blue equation as the length of the bottom.
the shelf is 2 times longer than the top shelf length
And we know that t is equal to m minus 12.
And if we simplify it a little bit, we get
The bottom shelf is equal to, let's multiply that by two.
2 times m is 2m
2 times minus half is minus 1
And that's all minus 12.
Or we could write it as b is equal to 2 times the length.
Middle shelf minus 32.
That's right.
1 is 22 and minus 12 is
Minus 32.
So now we've expressed everything through us and we can
Replace All
So top shelf instead of being here, so
We put m minus 12 here.
So let's put m minus 12 plus the length of the middle here.
shelf plus bottom shelf length
So, we've already expressed that through me.
That's what we just did.
Here is written the length of the bottom shelf depending on m
So instead of writing here, we're going to write 2m minus 32.
plus 2m minus 32 and that equals 12
All we did was replace it.
We expressed it using m and we expressed it using m.
Now we add up all the members with m and constants.
Here we have one and here we have another.
Then we still have 2m here.
and they're all positive
So 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4m.
So we have 4m.
and constant members
Here we have minus 12 and then we have minus 32.
So minus 12 minus 32 is minus 42, which is
Minus 2
So we have 4m minus 2.
And of course, it's still equal to 12.
On one side of the equation, we only want to have
unknown m
So we add to both sides plus 2, and we get rid of the 2 to
on the left
So if you add 2 on both sides of this equation,
so on the left hand side there will only be 4m and these members
cancel out and that's equal to 14.
Now we divide both sides by 4 and we get that m is equal to
14 over 4, that's 72 meters, because we're counting.
in meters
We know him now, but we still miss him.
What's t and b?
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
t is equal to m minus 12.
So it's equal to our m is 72 minus 12, and that's
equal to 62, or 3 meters
We count in meters, so we know that
It's in meters.
So the top shelf is 3 meters long.
The middle shelf is 7.2 meters, which is the same as 3.
And 12 meters.
And the bottom shelf is 2 times the top shelf.
Minus 12.
And that's how much?
That's 2 times 3 meters, that's the length.
Top shelf minus 12, which is 6.
Minus 12, or 5 and 12 meters.
And we're done.
And you can verify that the total is actually 12.
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 metres and that
means that equality is fulfilled
The top shelf is 12 metres shorter than the middle shelf.
bottom shelf is 12 metres shorter than
Double top shelf
And we're done.
We already know the shelf lengths that
Devon needs making.
