Fill the table with integers.
to write down the number 430 in five different ways
Think about it a little bit.
This 4 here we can see as 4 hundreds.
So four hundred.
And here's 3 in the tens place, so 3 tens.
That's four hundred and three tens.
But there's another way to write it.
For example, we can only have 3 hundreds.
We took 100 from the site of hundreds and now
we can put it in place for dozens
if you take the 100 and put it in place for the tens
100 is 10 tens.
Now you have 10 tens, but before that you had 3 tens.
So you're going to have 13 tens here.
Maybe it seems a little confusing.
Remember, it's 430.
This is 300 plus 130.
That's still 430.
Similarly, you can also see it as 200 plus 230.
230 is the same as 23 tens.
The same way you can look at it as 100 plus 330.
33 tens is 330.
It can also be seen as 0 hundreds and 43 tens.
43 tens is 430.
