I now give the floor to Mr Maybrerle.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
It is a great honour for me to be able to speak here.
I will try to brief you here with our big data tool, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
So before I really start, I would like to inform you about the situation in Austria's largest municipalities.
These are municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants, and since the year two thousand and eleven, we have the power to control all these local governments.
Before that, the limit was twenty thousand.
So the gray points represent more than twenty thousand inhabitants, and the blue ones less than twenty thousand.
The explanation is still in German.
Sorry about that.
In total, we are therefore entitled to audit seventy-five municipalities.
This represents about 3.2 percent of the total number of municipalities.
However, we provide advice to all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, in our department, we have decided to develop a special tool that we call the Municipal Monitoring Tool.
The development team consists of three young economists who work in our department. I am one of them.
All three of us use this tool for different purposes.
So what was the purpose of this tool, why was this tool created in the first place?
The main reason was to try to find an analytical tool for assessing financial risk.
So first we try to design a profile for each municipality.
Considering all the relevant factors.
In a second step, we assess the municipalities with regard to their importance for the audit activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we rank municipalities according to financial risk based on certain indicators.
The order is always interesting, it is the most interesting thing about all of this because it gives us the opportunity to compare all the municipalities.
Thank you.
So the hardest task of any database project is collecting quality data.
We heard about it a day earlier.
In this context, we must mention that we are greatly helped by the data of Statistics Austria, which is the Austrian Statistical Agency, and this agency is our most important partner in this project.
We got the following data from them.
This data is actually available to every citizen.
However, if you want aggregated data, you have to buy it from Statistics Austria.
And only aggregated data is useful for analysis.
So we have cross-cutting accounts of budgets and accounting regulations.
We have detailed information about closed accounts, so we have accounts at the level of free tickets.
And then we have statements of debt and liabilities.
So we use mainly financial and accounting data, but of course we have separate population data and other data that come from Statistics Austria.
Now we have data from this period from year two thousand eight to year two thousand thirteen.
And that's a mistake, for which I apologize.
We constantly update this data, every autumn.
Because we have data from municipal accounting systems, we have no data on municipal contributions, we have no data on rental obligations, nor do we have any data on balances and assets because municipalities do not publish these data.
This is important because in practice you have an official accountant in the municipality, you find out some amount of debt and if you look at the contributions of the companies to the municipality, it may be that you find this value of debt again here, so it will be a duplication and if you just check the accounts of the municipality itself, you only have half.
So from the existing data, we think our indicators are good, which I will explain later, and we will try to create an indicator model and this monitoring is based on a model that consists of indicators that are compiled as evaluation indicators broken down by topic.
From this, statistics are derived from one to 100, which is most relevant to the audit.
This model therefore allows indicators to be evaluated according to specific themes.
And in order to determine audit relevance, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses financial situation indicators as a basic setting, but depending on the issue raised, depending on the audit topic, you can choose a different setting of indicators.
Then you get a different result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four themes and the first is the financial situation in the long term.
That means we take net debt plus liabilities minus holdings of securities and minus reserves.
So the first one gives us a long-term perspective, that is, debt minus assets.
And the other one gives us a short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we define the basic balance, which is current revenue excluding transfers minus current expenditure excluding transfers and pensions.
This is an important point in the indicator model, because we do not use the key figures I have expressed per capita.
We use a different figure as a relevant number, namely our own revenues, because it is better to show the economic strength of the community.
Next comes the administrative structure.
That's where we simply put together administrative expenses and personal expenses.
Personal data is the most challenging task for us.
We tried to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And, yes, we take into account other accounts, different accounts, representation expenses and special account analysis.
This means that we are trying to find accounting errors using this data.
This image is therefore a screenshot of one possible output of the monitoring tool
And you see communities that are at the bottom of the list, from the best to the worst.
The black column therefore indicates the value and this is in view of the importance of audit activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors. In this figure, it is therefore assessed for the importance of audit for our departments.
So the four columns on the right are the indicators.
Indicators of the model I explained before.
The black column gives a value of three point thirty-three, which is the village of Halvank, a small village near Salzburg and is the best municipality.
So this is a benchmark.
So if you want to audit the municipality with the best financial position in the best financial situation, we will audit Halvank.
If you would like to audit the worst village, just skip the picture and drive to the last one, but today I don't want to show you these communities.
We have all Austrian municipalities in our system, but not every municipality falls under our metering obligation, so only the second, yes we can audit only the second.
We try to compare municipalities with the same class of municipalities of the same size, so we don't compare Vienna with Halvanko. We try to find similar municipalities to make the comparison fair.
So we have many different output options for this tool, and another feature is this output journal for each individual municipality.
So we have the village of Halvank, for example.
We can do such a diary for every municipality in Austria and you will not be able to read it, as you can see, but it will give us a whole range of key figures, indicators, graphs and information about the financial situation and its development.
Another output of the journal is these two pages, where for example you can see on the left an analysis of personal expenses, it's that red line of the graph.
And when comparing with other municipalities, you can choose the blue line, and where the red line crosses the blue line, the municipality is worse.
Or
So you can easily judge whether the municipality has excessive spending.
And on the right-hand side we have transfers, which means we have outgoing and incoming money from the community perspective.
But these are only two outputs out of many.
We currently use some statistical programs, such as R Stat Plus, and we can do whatever analysis is necessary - which our superiors want us to do.
As you can see, we use this tool for audit planning, for preparation, for operational matters and on-demand, that is, if someone wants to use this community just for presentation, they can use that journal.
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in the region, we can do it and this information helps us not only in the audit itself.
And in line with our advisory approach, we provide substantive information to municipalities.
This means that if a mayor calls us and wants to know about his community and what their financial situation is in this community, we can provide them with overviews and a diary.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
