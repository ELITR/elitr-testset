<CENSORED>, are you receiving?
Shall I begin?
Yes.
Right, ha ha ha, I'm sorry.
First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your conference on electronic data.
The right to access government information is a fundamental democratic right.
This requires the government to share public information.
Since the law came into force, the company has changed a lot.
Information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
Over time, virtually all people began using the Internet, often on multiple devices.
The twenty-first century government can respond to these tasks by giving the public direct access to government information.
In other words, the government could actively publish open data.
In that case, the volume of open data has to be considered in the context of the digital governance transition.
The pace in this area is set here by the UK, along with the US.
These countries clearly do not view open data as an objective, but as a means to achieve greater transparency.
They are world leaders in terms of open government partnerships.
This is an initiative to make the government as open as possible.
And there are several European directives and treaties in Europe that are important for open data legislation and policy.
The Dutch government, too, has considerable ambitions in the area of open data and has adopted new rules.
But actual implementation is still in its infancy.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former chairwoman, Ms Stuiveling, see great potential in open data.
In 2013, we decided to monitor the development of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We have conducted a survey focused on the commitment of ministries to an open data policy.
Our approach is positive because we have concentrated on ministries that have done well and, on the contrary, we have tried to encourage ministries that have fallen behind.
Through meetings with open data experts and civil servants and the publication of factsheets with good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we stressed the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers opportunities for the government.
By openly reporting on its spending and performance, the government will have a better idea of its own funding.
This will change the way Parliament oversees the government.
Open data sets would increase transparency and accessibility of government for citizens.
From a business perspective, innovative entrepreneurs can convert open data into new applications.
One of our goals was to find out what the Netherlands could learn from the UK and the United States.
Using data for an open data biometer performed by the World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of open data.
Awareness of delivering positive results from government open data initiatives.
The extent to which open data are available.
And the impact on society, the economy and government.
Um, society, economy and government.
And if we compare... excuse me.
Excuse me.
My voice is kind of hooked up in the monitor.
It disturbs me a lot.
All right.
We can continue.
If we compare Great Britain and the United States with the Netherlands,
This is based on the UK and US in terms of implementation and impact better.
There is little difference in their readiness for open data.
The Netherlands, on the other hand, is significantly worse prepared.
This only applies to the right to information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the UK and the United States publish much more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data sets is huge in the United States.
The type of data that countries publish varies in number of points.
The Netherlands currently publishes little open data on government spending and public procurement.
The Dutch business register is not very open either.
As you can see, by contrast, the UK has open data in all areas.
The impact of open data has a political, social and economic dimension.
In social and economic terms, the Netherlands lags behind both the UK and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in the design and control of government policy.
The economic benefits of open data are very small.
In both of our reports, we have given international examples that can set a good example for the Netherlands.
And in Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on hospital waiting times.
We didn't rely solely on open data barometers.
and we did our own research.
And to get a better idea of the currently available volume and type of open data
We looked at the data published on our national open data portal.
In all, three thousand two hundred data sets were available in February, two thousand and fifteen.
And slightly more than half of the data sets were provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by the central government comes from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands is the ministry's public works.
In the case of our two reports, we asked all ministries what steps they were taking to publish open data.
The scores we gave to each ministry were based on six indicators.
These included support from the ministry's management and the entity's action plan.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have taken exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and what funds they provided in the year two thousand and fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice had neither the time nor the money to publish public data.
However, other ministries have mandated the disclosure of open data to several workers and have released the budget for these activities.
On the basis of examining the years two thousand thirteen and fourteen, we have concluded that open data is the standard, but it is not yet being applied in practice.
And given what was enacted in the field of open data, it was mostly about the government, what the government knows, rather than what the government is doing.
We also got some comments that rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should be better informed about what data is available.
They should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third was that the government had to invest in both; on both the supply and demand sides of open data.
For example, by establishing an open data institute.
For our report for the year two thousand and fifteen, we found that the government and ministries had taken steps towards a wider acceptance of open data.
And partly in response to our first report on open data, the Home Office is currently coordinating the entire government's analysis of the data set.
The Netherlands follows the good examples set by the UK and the United States.
There was a downside.
We also found that the open data provided through the national portal was one-sided.
Virtually all open data sets are geo data, geographic data, and almost all are published by one ministry.
Very little data is important which is important for the public control of government finances and government activity is available.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account for the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch government should therefore define targets and milestones in a specific action plan.
We also think that data opening should be mandatory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
This should determine which data is of the greatest social importance and which data should in any case be made available.
And the government should use open data itself, for example in decentralising social networks.
In the Netherlands, it is a major national programme under which responsibility is transferred from central government to municipalities.
Our reports have had a positive impact.
The Home Office will publish the results of a national survey of data this month.
The House of Representatives adopted a proposal for a national information infrastructure.
And based on the data inventory, the Home Office will set up a national open data agenda.
In this agenda, they will disclose what data will be opened and when it will be opened.
We try to lead by example.
We have published our own expenses on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors is spending its money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open spending.
The Treasury Department now plans to make detailed spending data available to the government next year.
All right.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is developing positively and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor developments.
Thank you for your attention.
If you are interested, you can find our reports on our website in English and our spending data in Dutch.
