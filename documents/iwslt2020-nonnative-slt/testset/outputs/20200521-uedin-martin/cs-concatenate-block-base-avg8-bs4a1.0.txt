Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
Our company is called Be Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on May 15, 2017 and was taken over by <NAME>on September 1, 2018.
We sell dresses and suits by Czech designers and tailors.
We pay attention to the quality of materials. Our clothes and suits are made from recycled and natural materials.
We would also like to mention the environmental problems in the fashion industry.
The fashion industry contributes most to environmental pollution.
And that is... over a hundred and fifty billion items of clothing are manufactured, and billions more of clothes are... burned or buried in pits.
By 2030, the fashion industry will grow as the population increases.
A typical clothing production cycle is as follows: the acquisition of materials to make fabrics, the manufacture of fabrics, the weaving of fabrics, the preparation, i.e. dyeing and printing, and finally the sewing and finishing of clothing.
Thank you for your attention, have a nice day.

No, we sell them, we're all young people with innovative ideas.

Really?
I don't think I even have to buy the hat.
Goodbye!
Hey, my hat!
I'm tired.
The service on the train is so exhausting.
I have to sit somewhere.
Did I hear right?
Looking for a comfortable chair to sit in and relax in?
You're in the right place at the right time, and I'm probably the right person.
Another annoying salesman who wants to offer his products.
Wait, wait... before you get the wrong picture, let me introduce myself.
My name is <NAME> and I am the director of New Design World.
Our company was founded in 1981 in northeastern Italy by a group of young people united by a passion for furniture.
Our goal is to produce high-quality and sophisticated products available to a wide range of users.
For example, our comfy chairs are the perfect blend of beauty and elegance.
Oh, interesting.
Sounds like a good offer.
I was just about to upgrade my office, so go ahead.
We'd like to offer something that focuses on the customer without forgetting about quality, so we'd like to offer our sophisticated products.
And, so...
Would you be interested?
Yes, you talked me into it.
Great!
Now that you've planned the basis of your office, why don't you take a look at our modern shelves and desks?
They are carefully selected, environmentally friendly and the whole production takes place in Italy, as with all our products.
Oh, what a challenging day!
You're right, really challenging!
Do you think our participation in this fair will pay off?
Absolutely!
You know, I don't lack confidence because we sell fashionable and trendy products like bed linen and furniture...
People can't resist buying something from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are made in Italy: everyone knows that this is a guarantee of high quality.
You're absolutely right, but remember: We're here to make contact with new customers.
Can we apply ourselves to these new markets?
Well, you know, our headquarters are in Veneto, and that's the upside: we're so close to these markets, Eastern Europe is just around the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will be expensive!
It will mean a 5% loss in the first year.
Come on, think positive! The five percent will be our profit in the third year!
And I'm sure we got new customers today.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, everyone needs a good night's sleep.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, a comfortable mattress and a warm blanket to sleep on?
And it's all handmade by our skillful craftsmen!
What a dream!
Well, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!

What floor are you going to?
Hello, on the 15th.
And you?
The 22nd.
Do you mind if I take off my shoes?
Those high heels are killing me!
Of course.
I won't mind.
Thank you.
Why do you wear those high heels when you can wear sneakers?
I know a good shop that focuses on selling leisure shoes.
Oh, really?
Yes, I actually work for him.
It's called CaspoWalk Ltd. and we offer different types of shoes from different brands such as Nike, Adidas, for all ages and genders.
Do you offer any special shoes?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some pairs of shoes.
This month's special offer is Danish-style clogs, and if you like sports, you'd love a brand new pair of Nike shoes called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes that you control with your phone.
You can customize the tie of your shoelaces and the color of your LEDs using the mobile app.
If I buy shoes from you, will you offer me some accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer shoelaces and insoles and many other accessories.
Here's my card.
Be sure to stop by our store.
Okay, thank you.
You can find us in this building.
We are attending a trade fair of student companies.
Thank you so much!
We got to my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
Take care.
Nice to meet you, too.
Take care.
Good afternoon, everyone, my name is <NAME>. And my name is <NAME>.
I'd like to introduce you to SETA, which stands for smartphones, electronics and technology accessories.
We are a company that sells electronic devices, such as printers, smart phones and watches.
In addition, we are an international firm that communicates in French, English, Dutch and German.
We came here for the fair and we have special offers for buyers.
One of the discounts concerns the Instax camera.
When you buy this camera, you get a hundred photopapers for free.
It is important to note that we also have quantity discounts on orders over thirty products.
VAT is included in our prices.
Thank you for your time and I hope to see you at our booth, it's number sixty-three.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Hello my friends, my name is <NAME> and I'm going to take you through today's company presentation, in which I'm going to introduce the most famous fictional company, straight out of Austria, Total Regal.
Since 1999, we have ruled the market and crushed the dreams of other companies.
In fact, our C.E.O. ran this company before any of you were even born.
Imagine that.
So where is our headquarters located?
Mountains, of course.
No, I'm joking, we actually have other cities than Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirts and short leather pants, no, I'm kidding.
In truth, though, it may be that we bring out the traditional dress for one of the countless parties we throw when we want to have a beer or something.
Well, okay, more like two beers.
So why should you buy our products?
We've been selling the most popular of our products, which by the way have become true icons, since 1999, two decades ago.
For example, Helping Hand, which is a great way to store all kinds of clothes, such as jackets, or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and handbags.
So come and see our shop and as we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
So we would like to continue. I kindly ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to give its presentation.
Well, I hereby present our current status.
We have two national laws to make two directives for European regulation.
One is about paper and digital publications.
Now they have the same rate.
And in some circumstances, it's a zero rate, but in other circumstances, it's six percent.
In the case of rental property we have accepted ...the possibility of rental property ... ... and the mandatory VAT on short-term rental property.
Then we did two audits.
One concerns... what we've heard here several times, so I'll be very brief about it.
The second concerns the cash register system.
And then we also have two new four trends.
Our audit of the MoS... is not yet complete, nor is it published.
Therefore, all conclusions and recommendations are only preliminary.
But we are almost certain there will be no major changes.
Hmmm.
Our conclusions are essentially the same as what we have already heard here today.
But as far as we are concerned, I will just point out some things that are different, but which I think are more or less specific to Belgium.
We currently have only a limited number of staff in administration because we are more or less a beneficiary unlike MSID, which transfers money, and we depend heavily on other Member States.
But in the future, when MOS expands the most, more staff will be needed.
And they should now be trained and known up front.
Another general conclusion that we have reached, but which has also been made here, is that there have been changes in control strategies.
What needs to happen is a new line of thinking.
But our administration believes strongly in another MSID, because if we look at conclusions like MSCON...
Just jump from one to the other.
So we see that there is a very poor control strategy.
Therefore, we strongly believe that each MSID will send or transfer the money.
That's on us.
However, we stressed the importance of making some progress on the control strategy, by creating risk profiles.
So far, our administration hasn't been able to create good risk profiles because they don't have enough data, but they think they will in the future.
I have more data in the future and I could create some risk profiles, so in the future we will monitor whether the control policy will be better.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We follow other taxpayers on the internet, so there is a system to search for taxpayers on the internet.
But for now, the results are rather poor.
There are not many things about taxpayers that can be traced.
Then we see that...
The MSIDD registration process is fine as such, but in circumstances where taxpayers are logged out...
There's no follow-up if they file a return in the regular system.
So there is no link or any follow-up system, which we think is important.
Then we have ... in the process of filing a confession.
There are some automatic checks, which we find very interesting.
So it's not a real check of completeness and correctness (yes, thank you) of completeness and correctness.
Still, it helps when common mistakes are made.
Actual checks must therefore be carried out by MSCON, but as MSID, but Belgium still helps to complete the returns, so some errors are made.
There will be an alert in the system, or if you have to make a selection and all options are limited, just click on the possible options, so there will be fewer errors.
As MSCON, we also found out that they work in the Benelux.
So, together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they have created a matrix of certain risks and are developing new control activities.
In function of these risks and there are already two test sets that have started so far.
We therefore recommend working further in this small group to make progress and disseminate knowledge to European forums.
I think it's the differences that we had as opposed to what we hadn't heard before.
So we're going to do a second audit.
The cash register system has been audited.
This is not an audit carried out by Luden and myself, but carried out by other members of the audit cell.
It was also an audit that was a bit wider than just VT, but I will only present the conclusions and recommendations that are important for VT.
The audit focused on the effectiveness and efficiency of control policy.
Installation and application, so they looked at two issues related to the cash register system.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations they have drawn are that the regulation is too complex.
They therefore recommend simplification, because there are too many exceptions in the Regulation to the national Regulation.
That it was very difficult to establish a particular group on the basis of a statement alone.
And so it was very difficult to track or control certain groups of companies that had to install a cash register system.
Another big conclusion was the control policy.
There are problems with the taxpayer's choice of the cash register system.
If there was a limit, there's a limit, and if the admission is too low, then you fall right below that limit, and there's no control anymore, so this was a way to escape legislation.
There was also a problem with cross-checks of information data from taxpayer collection databases for their control.
Another conclusion was that there were poor internal controls for the application of the system as well.
As for the fines that were issued, they found that different inspection units gave different fines.
So there were no rules on fines, but some were very strict and other inspection teams were not strict at all, or had fines much lower than the rates they gave for certain errors, as well as risk analysis and online access.
It would be an advantage, but it is not implemented now, so the risk analysis was very simple and there is no online access, but as soon as we learned that this kind of system exists in other countries when they have online access.
They found that this could be a very good advantage.
Then there was also an exchange of information with the national social security office, which wasn't very good.
So a lot of information didn't get from one to the other.
Finally, about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with inserting transactions
As such, the system works very well if it is used, when it is used, as if it should be used, but when certain transactions were not entered into the system, they could not be discovered.
The solution could therefore be to create a media campaign so that customers can apply for a ticket.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise it will not be a ticket or that the legislation would be tailored to accept only electronic payments, because then it would be easier to track the money.
As an actual impact, however, there is no reliable measurement of impact management, so they have no idea.
Our team then ran some tests and tried to find an impact, but found that there was an expectation effect because the system was delayed for several years.
But everyone knew it was coming, so customers and companies were already expecting legislation that was going to make a change and introduce this system.
The exact differences between VAT receipts before and after 2016, when the system was introduced, were therefore very difficult to trace.
Because already a couple of years before 2016, VAT returns were getting bigger in light of the new system, which would have been subject to change.
Our team wasn't sure of the effect.
It's just this system or that the effect was even greater because it started earlier than they thought.
Look, I can interrupt you, I just, I have a problem, or I'd like to get it right.
What do I mean by a cash register system?
Does this mean that this cashier system is registered somewhere in the database?
No, it's not, it's online, it's a cash register, yeah "cash register."
Oh, okay, so it's just for cafes, hotels and restaurants.
It's only for a particular industry.
So far it is only in the Horeca sector and it is a system that registers every transaction or should register every projection that is embedded in the system.
(So) There is no online access.
This is why the selection of the control group is so important, because the control teams have to go to different places.
They can't target it online on a computer, they have to go to HoReCa and connect their computer to the checkout.
To pull data out of it and run a check.
Yes, but they can't do it remotely.
They always have to drive themselves to the facility.
So that's why the confession is too low and it's below the limit.
Teams won't go there to see if they know the café, for example, and they know there's a lot of customers and they're not there, but that's just a coincidence.
But that's something they found out later, so it's going to be them.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was afraid I was the only one who didn't understand.
Okay, but then what's the difference between this system that you're talking about a cash register at any retailer, I mean in food?
So what's so special about this particular system is that you're there.
There is special software that offers any possibility of system fraud and it is also software that ensures that data is transferable to the computer of control teams.
Whereas with a conventional cash register system, you can't extract data in the same way.
So it's the cash register systems that they have.
Yes, they're also special, but there are, I think, five different stamps of cash register systems from which you can choose and they're certified.
That all data that can be extracted in data formats is suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yeah, yes, so compatibility is certified, which is the main part of the domain of the different sections.
Yes, you mentioned this risk analysis, that there is a lack of risk services analysis, or they were not all carried out or.
Do I mean an online approach to this analysis or?
Online access to your own cash register system.
Okay, so that could make the checks a lot easier, okay, and because we can do automatic checks or data extraction.
Which could be put into a larger system, and risk analysis was actually very basic because they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or this system was only introduced in 2016, so they only had two years of data.
Okay, in conclusion.
I have two new fraudulent trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called Matrimony, which involved registering a large number of foreign companies.
But always by the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulgarian.
But they registered names that were very similar to well-known names.
There was only a single letter difference, just to make the plausible assumption that these companies existed, but most of them didn't exist at all.
And then they just filed a VAT return and asked for a VAT refund with false invoices, but they always did that in writing and for very small amounts.
Which means the administration had to input all the information into the system, which took time
Therefore, some refunds had already been made before they could actually establish that there was a possibility of fraud and could check whether the company actually existed and whether the invoices mentioned were real.
However, this type of fraud has been discovered and information about it is already being disseminated through eurofisc, so I think every tax administration is already aware of this type of fraud.
Another fraud involved green energy certificates, which were very similar to earlier CO3-2 certificates.
The fraudulent scheme was more or less the same in that they sent invoices.
Or they used the invoices of a firm that looked a lot like the law firm that was otherwise supposed to send the invoices.
So we had a plan of deception, I cut it really short, and I don't have a picture of it.
But let me put it this way.
There was a company A in Member State X which, according to the certificates from B in another Member State A, sold those certificates to C.
Again another Member State Z and sent that company an invoice from the corresponding A with a comma...
So that's a company name that's only one letter different from the original.
So Company C would not see that fraud is actually taking place.
And of course Company A and Company A with a comma were the same managers that have this Company A, and A with a comma would be the missing trader.
I hope this kind of fraud is clear.
And that was the end of my presentation.
If you please.
I would like to ask our Polish colleagues to give their presentation.
Thank you.
And just to refresh my memory, I would like to say a few words about the new regulations and new instruments that were introduced last year and during this year.
We introduced you to some of them at our plenary session in Warsaw last year.
So those of you who were in Warsaw should know something about it.
I would therefore briefly recall some of them and then tell you about our previous audit in this area and our conclusions.
First of all, I would like to mention the single audit file.
We started implementing these tools three years ago.
However, last year was the last stage, as the first stage was that a single set of audits had to be submitted to the tax authorities on request.
And now it's an automatic system.
The information shall be submitted electronically without any request.
And since July 1 of last year
this is mandatory for all types of economic operators.
Since 2016.
it was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, smaller and now for all businesses.
I will come back to that, too, because we see this as crucial in the fight against VAT cuts.
The second piece of legislation that I would like to mention is the so-called 'Fuel Package', and even in this case the regulation was introduced gradually.
It depends on the type of business and its main idea is that fuel trading licences are granted only to companies having their registered office in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign companies are registered for VAT, in their own countries, the same types of companies can benefit from their excise duty suspension procedures respecting the purchase of fuel within the Community, and VAT incurred as a result of the purchase of fuel within the Community will have to be paid immediately after the goods are dispatched to Poland or after the end of the excise duty suspension procedure.
Another regulation is the transport package.
It must be said that the draft of this law is based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this type was introduced in Hungary and in Poland we have introduced this system of tracking goods transport only for certain types of certain categories of goods.
They are generally goods on which excise duty is levied.
I am thinking of fuel, tobacco and some others, and by monitoring I am thinking of monitoring how these goods are transported by road or rail.
This means that each individual transport has to be declared before the start of the transport, in a separate system, a dedicated system and, since last year, every single transport has been linked to a geolocation system.
So for every single truck, you can tell where it is right now.
Roads, parking lots, etc.
And the finance minister for the Ministry of Finance, which analyses the whole big data system that has been delivered online, some of the public institutions, and so as we know, there may be many results and there may be some inconsistencies with many, and many may have found a business entity that provides them with this transport in a way that is abnormal in terms of routes, time, etc.
And we plan to audit the Treasury this year.
How is the Treasury prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is in place in the sense that all these companies have to register all traffic and the system is ready in the sense of the analysis being done online.
However, we do not yet know if the finance minister will use this information for any actions carried out by the tax authorities.
The next piece of legislation is to some extent similar to what our colleague who specialises in technical issues presented yesterday.
So we have a certain blacklist, but in Poland a blacklist means a list of entities that have been removed from the VAT register.
And we have an information-based system, again given by online banks and other entities of the financial system.
This system can be used by the Minister of Finance to identify potential irregularities and problems, and is aimed at capturing unusual transactions and providing information about them to the tax authorities online.
And based on that information, the IRS can block an account, a bank account, and a specific transaction.
What is the risk that a higher fine than, say, 10,000 Euro will be enforced?
Another piece of legislation is the distribution of payments, which was introduced last year.
It's optional at the moment.
But it's really up to the buyer.
If one contractor uses it, then the method of payment for the supplier is, of course, mandatory.
Importantly, if this mechanism of apportionment of payments is applied, then joint and several liability of the taxpayer is excluded.
I'm going to show you some numbers and in a little while I'm going to tell you about how this distribution can be used in a payment mechanism.
Finally, here is one legislative and organisational tool that our colleague from the Ministry of Finance presented in some detail last year.
So we have a new national revenue administration here, based on the previous free administration, and now we have another administration that fights tax and customs in one system.
Plus the online registration system
Ha ha ha.
At the moment we have a mandatory type of cash register system and a mandatory element of these cash registers is electronic memory.
So the IRS is able to verify authorized types of cash registers based on memory, but we are starting with an online system registration system only for some sectors.
These are primarily legal services, medical services, just some specific sectors.
The implication is that we must begin work on creating a central system, headed by the head of the national revenue administration.
In this system, all such transactions should be immediately and easily registered online.
And that is why we are engaging in this debate, so that we can introduce possible distributions of payments to all taxpayers affected by this.
This effectively means that we would like the tax authorities to wish to replace the reverse charge mechanism with such a payment and reverse charge mechanism and joint and several liability.
Thus, in all sectors where the devolved tax liability or joint and indivisible liability is mandatory, all of these sectors could be covered by this payment allocation mechanism.
Now, as I said before, let me tell you something about our audit.
We did the audit last year.
The period for which the audit was carried out was quite long - it was 12 years, which is why we were asked by the Public Finance Committee of the same Polish chamber of Parliament to carry out such an audit.
We have come to the following conclusions.
We had to conclude that the effectiveness of the Treasury's work has been highly volatile over this long period.
Between 2010 and 2015, the Ministry and the tax authorities made, in our opinion, somewhat insufficient efforts to improve their efficiency in the area of VAT receipts.
As the subject of the audit was the Ministry of Finance's supervision of tax revenues, or the collection of taxes, namely the collection of VAT, this was reflected here.
One sign of this aforementioned volatility in work efficiency is
so called VAT GAP.
And during those years, the VAT GAP in Poland averaged 24 percent, which was about ten points higher than the EU median.
Among other things, we concluded that surveillance had not been effectively contacted.
So that's it.
It can be said that we have information about VAT GAP in Poland and EU countries and that we have numbers from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And as you can see, the average VAT GAP difference in Europe is certainly lower than in Poland; even without taking into account the source of the information, the figures speak quite clearly.
Mmmm.
I have already mentioned that our main tool and the main tool of the tax authorities, and also the idea that was put into practice during this period, was a single set of audits, and over the last two years the tax authorities have acquired the competence to use databases to analyse them .
For example, in 2017, four million invoices were automatically analysed, but only 3,300 alerts were issued based on these analyses.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed did not increase much - it was about five million, but the analysis generated more than 350,000 alerts.
This has been reflected in revenue, as the first stage is automatic analysis and then comes a warning sent by text or email.
So without any official procedure in tax proceedings etc.
And this system, or its first phase, the automatic phase, has brought us additional revenue, VAT revenue worth more than EUR 150 million per year.
I am talking about the figures for 2017 and 2018.
It should be noted that the increase in revenue occurred under conditions of a good economic situation and an improvement in VAT collection, which was the result of a wide-ranging package of legislative and organisational changes introduced in recent years.
Yet we are of the opinion that one of the main sources of these results, of these financial results, is precisely the introduction of this single set of audits.
As a result of another instrument, this mechanism for apportioning payments in 2018 was followed by the use of a mechanism for apportioning payments, which, as I have already said, was optional.
However, we are seeing an increased interest in making payments in this way.
In July last year, taxpayers made 600,000 transactions.
In December, there were more than one and a half million transactions using the split payment mechanism.
The value of the tax paid through this split payment mechanism in July was half a billion euros.
And half a billion euros as of December 1st.
In total, over the period from July to December last year, more than seven million transactions were made by taxpayers using the payment-apportionment mechanism, and the tax amount in the special VAT accounts reached around six billion euros.
And one more piece of information on the work of the tax authorities, last year the tax authorities and the Ministry made 30 percent fewer checks than in 2017, but with fewer checks, the percentage of checks that were found to be irregular increased.
In our view, this is the result of the new electronic tools that have been introduced, which have helped to better select the bodies for which checks should be carried out.
It is clear that the reduction in the number of checks has been achieved by accompanying the reduction in the number of checks with an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is clearly less painful and time-consuming for taxpayers.
This led to a 100 percent increase in findings last year compared to 2017.
So, in general, we think that several legislative instruments have been put in place over the past couple of years.
In sum, the results are sufficient.
However, we must not forget that this was done in economically favourable conditions.
So it's not entirely possible to determine exactly what proportion of this increased revenue was due to which factor.
Whether this is the result of new organisational and legislative instruments
or if the overall economic situation is responsible.
That's all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions, please ask.
Do you have any other questions?
If not, I would ask for the floor from our Romanian colleagues.
Well, hello.
Can you all hear me okay?
Yes?
So we have 19% VAT in place in Romania for two years now.
And although plans have been made to cut it to 18 per cent, they have been shelved for the time being.
In addition, we have two reduced VAT rates, nine per cent and five per cent.
There have been several changes over the past year in terms of products that may have a reduced rate.
The biggest change, therefore, to sewerage services, where the rate was cut from nineteen per cent to nine per cent, starting from the first of January of this year.
Other items remain unchanged.
By contrast, there have been many changes to the 5 per cent rate, mainly to some products, which were at 9 per cent and have now been reclassified to 5 per cent.
The biggest change was last seen on 1 June this year; this change concerned high-quality food and mountain products, as well as traditional products.
And for products made in the mountains, the cows or sheep that produce them must live there for at least half their lives.
The manufacturer must get them an approval, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
He will then be able to apply a reduced rate.
Then there is the reverse charge mechanism.
In Romania, both companies need to be registered in order to be able to use the system.
There are fourteen products for which this can be shortened, and in December two thousand and eighteen had to be for some of them the deadline is extended until twenty-two.
Finally, the system of apportioning value added tax, which was introduced in the year two thousand and seventeen, although it now seems to have been somewhat forgotten by the Treasury.
In the year two thousand and seventeen, it started with more than four hundred companies, and now in the year two thousand and nineteen, the number has fallen to forty-six per cent.
Moreover, in the year two thousand and eighteen, no new companies began to use the system.
So all the companies that started with this have since started to go back to the normal VAT system from that system.
In addition, the European Commission has ordered Romania to stop using the system.
So the system seems to have failed to deliver what was expected of it, so the ministry is likely to stop using it altogether.
Completely?
I base myself on the data we have, because no new companies were registered in the year two thousand and eighteen, nor in the year two thousand and nineteen.
So there are only companies in the system that started in year two thousand and seventeen, and their numbers are slowly decreasing.
With regard to all these findings, there are still some regulatory gaps with regard to the MOSS system, which in Romania is for some reason referred to as M1SS because it has been translated.
But that's the way it is.
In addition, we lack IT systems at the financial services offices that can cooperate with each other and exchange data.
Which will not make things any easier for companies, and last year we finally introduced the electronic system they have in Belgium.
They have introduced electronic cash registers and companies are now obliged to start using them, so the tax authorities are checking that all companies have them installed.
However, for the time being, we are not sure whether the system is fully operational due to the limits in the financial authorities' IT system.
And so far, no new trends have been identified.
So, that's it.
Thank you.
Okay, so we did this audit.
The audit report will be published on 16 July.
Therefore, keep this information confidential.
They are under an information embargo until the date of publication.
We await the Commission's response in all 23 official EU languages.
Because we only have an answer in English, so it's just a formality and the audit is now over.
The title was 'Many challenges...' and the special report will read 'Many challenges in collecting VAT on customs duties remain to be solved'.
It remains to be resolved.
Originally it was going to be "There will be a need for reflection" but some have already been addressed to some extent through new legislation, a new Commission proposal which has just mentioned <CENSORED>.
However, there are still problems to be solved and we will see later.
So I'll start with why we chose this auditing topic.
What we're looking at.
They're looking for something.
And we'll conclude with our recommendations.
First of all, ok, we did a survey because we are following up on previous research analyses.
Based on the findings of the head of these institutions in the field of e-commerce, German colleagues, Lithuanian colleagues carried out audits.
Also, in the previous decision we made on imports, we analyse the issue of distance from non-EU countries and the related issues on VAT and customs duties, and we decided that it was worth going deeper during this audit.
The problem is that honest traders are often excluded from the market by dishonest traders and can no longer compete.
This is a problem that has also been raised by academics such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and is particularly intense in the UK.
Loss estimates, too.
There are only estimates of distances from outside the EU.
But these estimates are not very encouraging, because even though the commission estimates only five billion a year, in the UK it is between £1 and £1.5 billion a year.
That's how they assessed the losses.
This represents an 8 to 10% reduction in UK VAT.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently only accounts for four percent.
So three times the fight against fraud in the UK is represented by the volume of e-commerce losses on goods bought from third countries.
This is the mission.
We are not counting distance selling within the EU here, we are not counting the majority of electronic services here.
So the bottom line is to highlight our concerns.
Then what we are focusing on is that we are going to visit five Member States - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we took into account the number of MOS registrations in both non-EU and US programmes.
Also the volume of electronic sales within the EU and, finally, the estimated amount of VAT foregone as a result of the VAT exemption on imports of goods of negligible value (LVCR).
Following a study by our source at the commission, we also visited the commission.
These steps should debug the technology and the World Customs Organisation, and the repeal period ran from 2015 to the end of 2018.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal that has been tabled and all the proposals that will come into force in 2021.
What are we focusing on?
We have, of course, begun to analyse the responses to our survey, namely the survey sent by the main group two.
We are continuing with a questionnaire in all the Member States that we have visited with interviews with all sorts of people.
We have gained access and, what is also very important, we have set up access to ABC data to the Synergia database, i.e. the database of incidents, problems that Member States report in the MOS system.
We have been given access to all fiscali (fiscal) and e-commerce project groups and all BUT-related project groups where there is a lot of information and discussion about how the MOS works.
And, of course, we got funding from supporting institutions from Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and we ended up doing our own samples of different transactions.
Overall, we have combined nearly nine hundred e-commerce-related transactions.
What we are finding, of course, was first the positive things and then we will continue with the most negative things.
The regulatory framework is governed by best international practices, which have the extremes of the OECD and the World Customs Organisation.
In most respects concerning the OECD, with the exception of this principle, the principle of taxation at destination has been respected in most cases.
There is now a new threshold below ten thousand euros that you can file in the Member State of origin, so it is not in line with the OECD.
In the case of the World Customs Organisation, which deals with imported packages, the immediate release guidelines were followed in most respects, as well as the new proposal under the standards.
The Commission is a pioneer in this area, adapting to the World Customs Organisation and standards in most respects.
As for the new provision, which will enter into force in 2021...
I am trying to address some of the weaknesses, but for us, the main problem that will continue to occur is undervaluation.
Losses from VAT and customs duties are experience and will continue to be.
And this cannot be addressed by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As for trade with non-EU countries, this will not be resolved and we will see why later.
Why, because administrative cooperation agreements with third countries do not work.
We have a new agreement with Norway.
We expect a change of information with Norway that it will work, but that's not a problem.
It's not Norway, the problem is China, it's the United States of America.
The information chain with China doesn't work because the Chinese counterpart isn't responding and the response rate goes down and down and down, so that's the problem.
If we have information about a change of supplier who is not working through an electronic interface, i.e. working directly on his website, who has not registered with the MOS or even registered and after we cancel the registration, he opens a new website...
So how come we pay VAT from Europe to China, and we expect VAT to come back to the EU.
Unless we also have the cooperation of the administration.
That will never happen.
This is a problem even among EU countries, it is not working as expected.
Also the cooperation of the administration, so we will see later that the controls carried out by the national tax authorities are weak.
Because there are virtually no tools to carry out the proper chance risk analysis that we have already mentioned.
Therefore, it will be necessary for the Member State to approve the Commission's proposal to amend the information, with payment service providers under the Commission's control being insufficient.
And we'll see later, of course, that the board did not do any monitoring about it, any monitoring.
There are weaknesses in the electronic check-in systems themselves.
The traditional problem, of course, is that traders undervalued goods to be below the euro threshold of twenty-two or ten years for VAT.
And that will disappear in the future, but they will continue to undervalue to pay lower VAT.
It will not be approved, but they will pay less and, as far as customs obligations are concerned, the assumption is set at one hundred and fifty euros and they cannot cope.
Because in all electronic ... we will see the EU's electronic clearing system later, they cannot stop the declaration.
Because they tick the box of their own electronic..., which they apply to the customer electronically for relief purposes.
And they passed the system, even though they declared a value that was over a hundred and fifty.
The electronic system can't stop it, they said it was something very serious because the operators working there are promising economic operators.
So, the big couriers have the authority of the Economic Operators Association and claim to be the most reliable, but they abuse the system.
Enforcing the collection of VAT duties is not effective.
Okay, provision for a chain of information on recoveries related to this tax.
They were rarely used, out of the five Member States we visited, only in Austria.
Only in five cases, so it's not often used.
We analyse the mismatch of payments between Member States.
We have an approach to harmonisation by the Commission and there are still missed combinations.
Important means a lot between Member States.
In the Netherlands, of course, the problem is that they fail to harmonise, which explains the amounts of VAT received with the VAT return.
And the problems are also with the reminders that even our colleagues from NKU yesterday...
They anticipated a problem with Member States' comments on consumption which are not ...
Here is a summary of our findings on MOS samples.
We concluded that the MOS IT infrastructure suits its purposes, so it is strong.
It can be handled by the user, so the IT infrastructure is solid, but there are problems with registration and payments between Member States.
For example, as regards the analysis of the occurrence reported in Synergie, in the Synergie database between Member States, but in five Member States there are only a few twenty-two cases.
Which we have reviewed, in which Member State with the origin of the problem and as an affecting Member State.
There were only 12 cases, so there were not as many cases, the problem is that the attitude of the Member States was really passive.
It was only when the problems escalated that they started working on it, but it takes a long time to solve the problems.
As far as MOS is concerned, it takes long periods, but there are not many problems.
Also, in terms of technical error messages sent and received between Member States, the response is also very passive, not being proactive only when the problem escalates as an incident to which they start to respond.
But this infrastructure for MOS is robust.
We have assessed whether they are ready for a single point of contact.
We have received several complaints, particularly from Austria.
They say they will not be ready, even from the Dutch route, which we have not analysed, because the system is being developed mainly on demand using a single point of contact for import.
Registration issues are here.
We need to distinguish between the non-US and the EU system, only eighty per cent of registrations were not properly checked.
As far as the known system outside the US is concerned and we have even found it, we have found cases of double registration, which is something serious, then as far as payments are concerned, the problem in particular is the problem of missing reminders in the Member State of consumption.
And sometimes by Member State of identification.
And problems with registration and deregistration.
This is the most related administrative cooperation, it is an exchange of information between the Member States we have visited.
And here we compare with the overall activity of information chains, which we see, for example, that there are overall information requirements that have been sent to one hundred and eighty-two compared to the overall information requirements.
They are generally unrelated to the normal nine thousand two hundred, so even in the UK many of them will not be more problematic, for example triple problematic.
The level of the information chain is good, it is very low, and also some Member States have not changed, which is not why we recommend separating the CNO centralised home office.
A separate structure designed for e-commerce, or at least for the MoS, so the level of transmission of information is very weak.
Then we have multilateral controls, in two cases there were six cases of multilateral controls.
It was a really successful experience.
However, in two cases this was not successful at all because the Member State of identification refused to participate in the multilateral control.
This is something that should be solved by enforcing new legislation, because now two Member States can ask for a check to be carried out.
And another is the recent request that the second Member State of identification cannot refuse such participation.
So hopefully it will improve, but there are other significant things for Eurofisc.
There were four hundred and eighty signals, a chain through Eurofisc working for e-commerce as many as five, and only one feedback on those four hundred and eighty.
Therefore, the Member State did not find this information very useful, they do not know why only five Member States were selected, they entered the elderly in the database.
And others didn't read it because they didn't find the information very useful.
So there are also a few signals related to trends or fraud themes, three or four topics that they find useful.
And then there are the changing tools for web crawling, but that's something that some members are taking over legally in their country.
In other Member States, internal legislation prevents them from using web crawling tools.
Now the work file is frozen and frozen activities are not useful.
They are awaiting the design of an information chain between the payment service provider.
Because they will, they will be databases and they will have access.
This is the Commission's proposal regarding all information provided by the payment service provider to any other country, the Commission's proposal.
Of course, we are very supportive and we are putting a proposal in the report, but I did not know until I asked yesterday that the Commission also needed some support for this proposal because Lubik Lubis said there were problems.
However, I took this as a matter of course in the council, because this proposal comes from some discussion in some forums with Member States and with stakeholders.
Hopefully... this is very important because another problem is the lack of controls, audits for the MoS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here that it's nobody, because it never is, how can I, if not, I don't know that I don't have an analysis of data areas.
So my audit is going to be a random selection with maybe a lot of information and no records, so they're going to need some data and this is the data.
In addition, the company will have many more applications.
Yeah, they seem to understand about Germany because we have the data.
A team outside the U.S., but information he may have at his disposal.
Phenomenon.
But I don't know any more, there is virtually no control.
Controls on knowledge about intra-EU distances have also been less than successful.
The customs office therefore has the results of a sample from a courier of and abuse of postal services.
At the post office the main problem in dealing with the undervaluation issue is you have drones very expensive drones declared under ten units or under twenty two euros.
Samples per se are a thousand times as simple.
And they can read and it's very difficult to handle at Post Office level.
And for a courier, they take advantage of the usual hundred-and-fifty relief, because they just tick the takeover box and then fifty can't close.
Declaration to stop the declaration, although devaluation higher than a hundred and fifty, we check that not only in the sample, also directly in the custom electronic system in the environment of the dam, where we have carried out several experiments.
Member States did not work in any Member State, only in Austria did it work.
But he didn't receive it in Austria.
We filed another alcohol declaration.
And then for alcohol it was enforced and because this categorisation is applicable to alcoholic products.
So there are also some errors in the Austrian system.
This, and the problem, is therefore the authorised economic operator exploiting this system by the most reliable custom traders.
We also have a recommendation for the commission to make use of the structures provided in mutual assistance treaties with non-EU countries.
To solve these problems, solve the problems and find out the lack of answers.
Also inspect Member States' controls at local level for relief.
At a minimum, monitor the operation of distance selling within the EU, mixed goods this recommendation is the only thing the commission has not accepted.
That's why they laughed last night, because your job is
Monitor the commission and <CENSORED 22:25> said: "Yes, yes, yes."
I laughed, but okay.
They help the Member State to develop a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for new arrivals.
Because this is a problem, we can't know whether the system works or not.
Most systems are supposed to be successful, but this is usually an assumption, which is why we have an estimate of the largest VAT gap.
We do not know whether the system is successful and we have no estimate for the European Union itself, so that would be very important.
As the Commission assists Member States in development, this is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative solutions.
Perhaps there could be help to tackle VAT fraud in the form of an alternative system for distributing payments.
Using blockchain technology, routes are designed, KPMG KPMG and also a design by Professor E. Ensworth.
There are very interesting proposals that we have, of course, discussed with the commission, and the Commission says that they are theoretical, they practically come to solutions.
In fact, they did not find a practical application, Professor Lamas also made several proposals to use the technology for imports from outside the EU.
But this system is accepted by many other countries.
There's no practical experience, but I think it's worth also going deeper with blockchain technology offering opportunities.
This is something that is also being examined by the Commission for the management of a database of important convenience stores.
Numbers to manage the validity of these numbers.
It is very important who it is for the future, the only way to deal with the use of the name of the new technology for the Member States.
Of course, we like the fact that they are starting to respond to fraudulent seniors and are adapting Eurofisc.
Also follow the compromise in line with the new limit value of EUR 10,000.
This is something that Czech colleagues highlighted in their report.
And we also took that into account for the reason they explained earlier.
In order to have a separate MOS and a remote co-ordination function for colleagues, we need to ensure that the trader can introduce the VAT rate, the correct VAT rate in the MOS VAT returns.
Because when a trader introduces the wrong VAT rate, they only receive advice, but the return can be sent anyway, so they receive advice, but it will still be sent.
Also do the necessary checks after receiving a registration application in MOS to avoid this issue of double registrations.
Increase the audit work of most of the MoS's distance traders and retailers using administrative cooperation tools.
Employee of regular VAT estimates in e-commerce.
So if for this recommendation to the Member States, we would be very grateful if you would remember in your home country the importance of following our recommendations.
That is why we seek your cooperation on this matter, and that is all we know if you have any questions.
I now give the floor to Mr Mayrbeurle.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
It is a great honour for me that they can speak here.
I will try to brief you here on our large data tool, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
So before I begin in earnest, I would like to inform you about the situation in Austria's largest municipalities.
These are municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants, and from the year two thousand and eleven we have the right to control all these local governments.
Before that, the threshold was 20,000.
Grey points therefore represent more than twenty thousand inhabitants and blue less than twenty thousand.
The explanation is still in German.
Sorry about that.
In total, we are authorized to audit seventy-five municipalities.
This represents about 3.2 percent of the total number of municipalities
However, we provide advice to all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, we have decided to develop a special tool in our department, which we call the Municipal Monitoring Tool.
The development team consists of three young economists who work in our department.
All three of us use this tool for different purposes.
So what was the objective of this instrument, why was this instrument created in the first place?
The main reason was to try to find an analytical tool for assessing financial risk.
So first we try to design a profile for each municipality.
Having regard to all relevant factors.
In the second step, we assess the municipalities with regard to their importance for the audit activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we rank municipalities according to financial risk based on certain indicators.
The order is always interesting, it's the most interesting thing about all this because it gives us the opportunity to compare all the municipalities.
Thank you.
So the hardest task for any database project is to collect quality data.
We heard about it a day earlier.
In this context, we must mention that we are greatly assisted by the Statistics of Austria, which is an Austrian statistical agency, and this agency is our most important partner in this project.
We obtained the following data from them.
This data is actually available to every citizen.
However, if you want aggregated data, you have to buy it from Statistics Austria.
And only aggregated data is useful for analysis.
So we have cross-cutting accounts of budgets and accounting regulations.
We have detailed information about closed accounts, so we have accounts at the free-ticket level.
And then we have debt and liability statements.
So we mainly use financial and accounting data, but of course we have separately population data and other data that comes from Statistics Austria.
Now we have data from this period from year two thousand eight to year two thousand thirteen.
And that's a mistake, for which I apologize.
We constantly update this data, every autumn.
Because we have data from municipal accounting systems, we have no data on municipal contributions, we have no data on rental obligations, nor do we have any data on balances and assets, because municipalities do not publish these data.
That's important because in practice you have some official accountant in the community, you find out some amount of debt and if you look at the companies' contributions to the community, you might find that value of debt here again, so it's going to be a duplication and if you're just checking the accounts of the community itself, you only have half.
So from the existing data, we think our indicators are good, which I will explain later, and we will try to create an indicator model and this monitoring is based on a model that consists of indicators that are compiled as scoreboards broken down by topic.
From this, statistics from one to 100 are derived, which is most relevant for the audit.
This model therefore allows the assessment of indicators by specific topics.
And in order to determine the relevance for the audit, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses financial situation indicators as the basic setting, but depending on the issue raised, depending on the audit theme, you can choose a different setting of indicators.
Then you get a different result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four themes, the first being the financial situation in the long term.
This means that we take net debt plus liabilities minus securities holdings and minus reserves.
So the first one gives us a long-term perspective, that's debt minus assets.
And the other one gives us a short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we define the basic balance, which is current income without transfers minus current expenditure without transfers and pensions.
This is an important point in the indicator model, because we are not using the key figures that I have expressed per capita.
We use a different figure as the relevant number, namely own revenues, because it is better to show the economic power of the municipality.
Next comes the administrative structure.
That's simply where we put together administrative expenses and personal expenses.
Personal data is the most challenging task for us.
We tried to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And, yes, we do take into account other accounts, various accounts, representation expenses and the analysis of separate accounts.
This means that we are trying to find accounting errors using this data.
So this image is a screenshot of one possible output of a monitoring tool
And you see the communities that are at the bottom of the list, from the best to the worst.
The black column therefore indicates the value and this is in view of the importance of audit activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors. In this figure, it is therefore assessed for the importance of audit for our department.
So, the four columns on the right are the indicators.
The model indicators I explained earlier.
The black column gives a value of three point thirty-three, which is the village of Halvank, a small village near Salzburg and it is the best municipality.
So this is kind of a benchmark.
So if you want to audit the municipality with the best financial location in the best financial situation, we will audit Halvanka.
If you would like to audit the worst municipalities, just skip the picture and go to the last one, but today I don't want to show you those municipalities.
We have all Austrian municipalities in our system, but not every municipality falls under our assessment obligation, so only the second, yes we can only audit the second.
We are trying to compare municipalities with the same class of municipalities of the same size, so we are not comparing Vienna with Halvanko. We are trying to find similar municipalities, so the comparison is fair.
So we have a lot of different output options for this tool, and another feature is this output diary for each individual municipality.
So we have the municipality of Halvank, for example.
We can make such a diary for every municipality in Austria and you will not be able to read it, as you can see, but it will give us a whole series of key figures, indicators, graphs and information about the financial situation and its development.
The next output of the journal is these two pages where, for example, you can see on the left the analysis of personal expenditure, it's the red line of the graph.
And when comparing to other municipalities, you can pick the blue line, and where the red line crosses the blue line, the municipality is worse.
Or
So you can easily assess whether a municipality is overspending.
And on the right-hand side, we have the transfers, which means that we have the outgoing and the incoming money from the community perspective.
But it is only two outcomes out of many.
We currently use some statistical programs, like R Stat Plus, and we can do whatever analysis is necessary - what our superiors want us to do.
As you can see, we use this tool for audit planning, for preparation, for operational matters and on-demand, which means that if someone wants to use this community just for presentation, they can use that journal.
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in the region, we can do that, and this information helps us not only in the audit itself.
And in accordance with our advisory approach, we provide municipalities with factual information.
This means that if a mayor calls us and wants to know about his community and what their financial situation is in this community, we can provide them with overviews and a diary.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
<CENSORED>, do you copy?
Should I start?
Yes.
Yeah, ha ha ha, I'm sorry.
First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your conference on electronic data.
The right to access government information is a fundamental democratic right.
This requires the government to share public information.
Since the law came into force, society has changed a lot.
Information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
Over time, virtually all people started using the Internet, often on multiple devices.
The twenty-first century government can respond to these challenges by giving the public direct access to government information.
In other words, the government could actively publish open data.
In such a case, the volume of open data should be considered in the context of the digital governance transition.
Meanwhile, the UK, along with the US, is setting the pace in this area.
Open data is clearly viewed by these countries not as an objective, but as a means to achieve greater transparency.
From a global perspective, they are in a leading position with regard to an open government partnership.
This is an initiative to make the government as open as possible.
And there are several European directives and treaties in Europe that are important for open data legislation and policy.
The Dutch government, too, has considerable ambitions for open data and has adopted new rules.
But actual implementation is still in its infancy.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former chairwoman, Mrs Stuiveling, see great potential in open data.
In 2013, we decided to monitor the development of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We carried out a survey focused on the commitment of ministries to an open data policy.
Our approach is positive, because we have concentrated on ministries that have done well and, on the contrary, we have tried to encourage ministries that have fallen behind.
Through meetings with open data experts and civil servants and the publication of fact sheets with good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we stressed the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers opportunities for the government.
By starting to report openly on its spending and performance, the government will have a better idea of its own funding.
This will change the way Parliament supervises the government.
Open data sets would increase government transparency and accessibility for citizens.
From a business perspective, innovative entrepreneurs can transfer open data to new applications.
One of our goals was to find what the Netherlands could learn from Great Britain and the United States.
Using data for an open data biometer conducted by the World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of open data.
Awareness of securing positive results from government initiatives on open data.
The extent to which open data is available.
And the impact on society, the economy and the government.
um society, economy and government.
And if we compare ... excuse me
Sorry
My voice is kind of stuck on the monitor.
It disturbs me a lot.
All right.
We can continue.
If we compare Great Britain and the United States with the Netherlands,
the UK and the US are doing better with regard to implementation and impact.
There is little difference between them when it comes to their readiness for open data.
The Netherlands, on the other hand, is prepared significantly worse.
This concerns only the right to information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the United Kingdom and the United States publish much more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data files in the United States is huge.
The type of data countries publish varies by number of points.
The Netherlands currently publishes little open data on government spending and public procurement.
The Dutch Trade Register is not very open either.
As you can see, by contrast, the UK has open data in all areas.
The impact of open data has a political, social and economic dimension.
Socially and economically, the Netherlands lags behind both the UK and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in the creation and control of government policy.
The economic benefits of open data are very small.
In both our reports, we have set international examples that can set a good example for the Netherlands.
And in Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on hospital waiting times.
We didn't just rely on open data barometers
and we did our own research.
And to get a better idea of the currently available volume and type of open data
we looked at the data published on our national open data portal.
In total, three thousand two hundred data sets were available in February at two thousand and fifteen.
And slightly more than half of the data sets were provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by central government comes from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands is the ministry's public works.
In the case of our two reports, we asked all ministries what steps they were taking to publish open data.
The scores we gave each ministry were based on six indicators.
This included, for example, support from the Ministry's management and the Entity Action Plan.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have taken exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and what funds they provided in the year two thousand and fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice had neither the time nor the money to publish public data.
However, other ministries have mandated a few staff to publish open data and have freed up the budget for these activities.
Based on an examination of years two thousand and thirteen, we concluded that open data is the standard, but is not yet being applied in practice.
And given what was enacted in open data, it was mainly about the government, what the government knows rather than what the government does.
We also got some comments that rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should be better informed about what data is available.
They should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third was that the government must invest in both; on the supply and demand side of open data.
For example, by establishing an open data institute.
For our report for year two thousand and fifteen, we found that the government and ministries have taken steps to accept open data more widely.
And partly in response to our first report on open data, the Home Office is currently coordinating the entire government analysis of the data set.
The Netherlands is thus following the good examples set by the UK and the US.
There was a disadvantage.
We also found that the open data provided through the national portal was one-sided.
Virtually all open data files are geo data, geographic data, and almost all are published by one ministry.
Very little data is relevant to public control of government finances and government activity is available.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account for the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch government should therefore define targets and milestones in a specific action plan.
We also think that the opening of data should be mandatory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
This should determine which data is of the greatest social importance and which data should be made available in any case.
And the government should use open data itself, for example in the decentralisation of social networks.
In the Netherlands, this is a large nationwide programme where responsibility is transferred from central government to municipalities.
Our news has had a positive impact.
The Interior Ministry will release the results of a nationwide survey of data this month.
The House of Representatives has adopted a proposal for a national information infrastructure.
And based on the inventory of the data, the Department of the Interior will establish a national open data agenda.
It will publish in this agenda what data will be opened and when it will be opened.
We are trying to set an example.
We have posted our own expenses on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors is spending their money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open spending.
The Ministry of Finance now plans to make detailed spending data available to the government next year.
All right.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is progressing positively and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor developments,
Thank you for your attention.
If you are interested, you can find our reports on our website in English and our spending data in Dutch.
we have the role devon is going to do 3 shelves for
of his father
has a piece of board that is 12 meters long
wants the top shelf to be half a metre shorter than
middle shelf
I'll do it in different colors
so he wants the top shelf to be half a metre shorter than
middle shelf
read the whole entry first
and the lower shelf should be half a metre shorter than twice the length
top shelf
select a different color
I'll do it in blue
the bottom shelf will be half a metre shorter than double
upper shelf lengths
how long the individual shelves will be if
consumes the entire 12-metre board
let's mark the variables of different shelf lengths
because that's what we have to calculate
we have the top shelf and the middle shelf
and bottom shelf
so let's say t denotes the length of the top shelf
t denotes the length of the top shelf
and m will be equal to the length of the middle shelf
m stands for middle shelf
a b will indicate the length of the bottom shelf
b is therefore the bottom shelf
now we find out what these different statements tell us
so the first statement says that devon wants to have a top shelf
use the same color wants to have the top
a shelf half a metre shorter than the middle shelf
so he wants the length of the top shelf to be
half a metre smaller than the length of the middle shelf
we have all the variables in meters so we can write
middle shelf length minus
12 meters
exactly this is what the orange-underlined sentence tells us
the top shelf must be 12 metres shorter than the length
middle shelf
so and what the next statement tells us
and the bottom shelf must be
12 meters shorter than
double the length of the top shelf
so it's 12 meters less than double
upper shelf lengths
these are both statements written down
using equations
the length of the top shelf is equal to the length of the middle shelf
minus 12
is 12 meters shorter than the middle shelf
and the bottom shelf must be 12 metres shorter than
double the length of the top shelf
so and how do we solve it
no only with these two equations to solve it
we can't but there's more information in the entry
we have entered here how long the individual shelves will be if
devon uses the full 12 metres of plank
so the length of all the shelves has to
be together 12 meters
consumes everything to produce
so t plus m plus b has to be 12 meters
these are the lengths of each of the shelves
and she uses a total of 12 meters of boards
so the sum of the plank lengths has to give 12 meters
so what can we do about it
no we can express everything depending on one variable
we express that depending on m and then subtract them
t-to-m dependency we already have expressed
we can replace all t in the equations
relation m minus 12
but here b is dependent on t
how it can express it depending on m
well we know t is equal to m minus 12
replace all t variables
with this expression
t is equal to
we can rewrite the blue equation as the length of the bottom
shelves are 2 times longer than the length of the top shelf
and we know that t is equal to m minus 12
and if we simplify it a little bit we get
the bottom shelf is equal to distribute it by two
2 times m is 2m
2 times minus half is minus 1
and all of that minus 12
or we could write it as b is equal to 2 times the length
middle shelf minus 32
is that so
1 is 22 and minus 12 is
minus 32
so now we've expressed everything with m and we can
put everything back
so the top shelf instead of there being t so
we put m minus 12 here
so we put m minus 12 plus the length of the middle
shelf plus length of bottom shelf
so and we've already expressed that with m
that's what we just did
here is the length of the bottom shelf depending on m
so instead of writing b here, let's write 2m minus 32
plus 2m minus 32 and that equals 12
all we did was replace t
we expressed t using m and we expressed b using m
now we add all the members with m and the constants
here we have one m here another and
then we still have 2m here
and they're all positive
so 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4m
so we have 4m
and constant members
here we have minus 12 and then we have minus 32
so minus 12 minus 32 is minus 42 which is
minus 2
so we have 4m minus 2
and of course it still equals 12
on one side of the equation we just want to have
unknown m
let's add plus 2 to both sides and get rid of 2 to
on the left hand side
so if we add 2 on both sides of this equation
that leaves only 4m on the left side and these members
cancels out and that's equal to 14
now we divide both sides by 4 and we get m is equal to
14 over 4 that's 72 meters because we're counting
in meters
now we know but we still miss
how much is t and b
let's do this
let's do t
t is equal to m minus 12
so it equals our m is 72 minus 12 and that's
equal to 62 or 3 meters
we're counting in meters because we know
it's in meters
so the top shelf is 3 meters long
the middle shelf is 72 metres which is the same as 3
and 12 meters
and the bottom shelf is 2 times the top shelf
minus 12
and that's how much
that's 2 by 3 meters that's the length
top shelf minus 12 which is 6
minus 12 or 5 and 12 meters
and we're done
and you can verify that the total is really 12
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 meters and that
means equality is achieved
the top shelf is 12 meters shorter than the middle shelf
the bottom shelf is 12 metres shorter than
double top shelf
and we're done
we already know the shelf lengths that
devon needs to be made
fill the table with integers so
to write the number 430 five different ways
think about it a little bit
this 4 right over here can be seen as 4 hundreds
so 4 hundreds
and here is 3 in the tens place so 3 tens
that's 4 hundreds and 3 tens
but there's another way to write it
for example, we can only have 3000
we took 100 from a place of hundreds and now
we can put it in place for tens
if you take the 100 and put it in the tens place
100 is 10 tens
now you have 10 tens but before you had 3 tens
therefore you're going to have 13 tens here
maybe it seems a little confusing
don't forget it's 430
this is 300 plus 130
that's still 430
similarly you can also see it as 200 plus 230
230 is the same as 23 tens
in the same way it can be viewed as 100 plus 330
33 tens is 330
it can also be seen as 0 hundreds and 43 tens
43 tens is 430
welcome we'll tell you about the internet
which is what you're using
the internet is a large network of interconnected computers
and by 2014, more than
a billion websites
whole billion
not long ago it was only a million
and it was already a lot
what we use the site for
they used them at first
scientists to share their research
for example, a particle accelerator
but now everyone uses them for almost anything
it is possible to write with your family via social networks
share with others photos
of their cute kittens
Trips abroad can be planned at travel portals
and on those intelligence
to find out what's going on
and then of course you need to use the site
khan academy for study
so what's your favorite site
I actually have a slightly better question for you
what a page you are missing on the internet should look like
maybe a page about you
or something you like
the cool thing is that you can program such a page yourself
and you can learn it here at the khan academy
think about what you want to create first
because soon you'll learn how to do it
but for starters, let's get the terminology straight
what exactly is the Internet
like I said it's a lot
linked computers to websites
when a computer is connected to the internet and provides a website
we call it a server
by English serve serve
the website is written in three languages
html forming the page structure
css then edits its appearance and javascript page makes it interactive
how users see these sites
we use an internet browsing app to do this
such as chrome firefox or internet explorer
these applications we call browsers
browsers are all trying to display the page anyway
but they have some differences
that's why we sometimes say
oops an error occurred try using a different browser
what browser you are using right now
you have to use that browser on a device
maybe on a laptop phone tablet or smart TV
we call all these devices clients
clients can be very different
some are smaller than others
some have touchscreens others have keyboards
some are black and white
websites try to look good
on all different devices
and what equipment you use
and that's the Internet
thus its two-minute version
there's a lot more we can learn about it
but I think it's time to start writing some html and css
and create your own website
shade 109
just to repeat if we wanted to break down 109
it would literally be 109 percent which is the same thing
like 109 for and now I could re-write a cent
but we already know that
A cent means 100 literally so this is
means 109 out of 100
if we had 100 out of 100 we would have one whole
but now we have more than the whole
we have 109 out of 100
we can write it as a ratio or a fraction
it's the same thing as 109 divided by 100
equal to 109/100
let's shade it out
here we have the whole we will
consider this square as a whole
in the last video we did the math
it's a 10 by 10 square
is divided into 100 parts
we want to get 109 of these 100 parts
how it will look
it means we shade everyone
100 parts here
I'll do it with a new color
so let's color this whole
if we colored just that we would have 100
it would be 100 divided by 100 or 100 out of 100 or 100
I think it's becoming clear to you
I don't want you to just memorize it
literally that means 100 out of 100, or whole
so it's a whole square
it's 100 out of 100 here
the question is to color 109
we've already done 100 out of 100 but we still have to do another 9
so let's color another 9
so now we have 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9
this piece right here
That's exactly it
it's 9 whole squares
this is 100 of the whole square
if we take this whole piece and add this blue part to it
we get 109 one
entire square
I hope it makes sense
let's do a few examples
let's see
first example
how much is 15 out of 40
we solve examples with percentages by converting
percentages to the decimal, which we then multiply
the number of which we want to calculate the percentage
so 15 expressed by decimal is zero point 15 hundredths
we've already learned that hopefully in the video on converting percentages to decimal numbers
in the video perhaps
and we just multiply it by 40
so 40 times zero point 15 hundredths
5 times 0 is 0
5 times 4 is twenty
shift down
we write zero
and then 0 times 0 is 0
1 times 4 are 4
and we get six zero zero
we write the decimal point
one two
top decimal point is not so one two and comma
belongs here
so 15 of 40 is equal to zero point 15 hundredths times 40 which is equal to 6 point zero hundredths
this is the same thing as 6
another example
I hope that didn't confuse you too much
now I'm going to try to confuse you
unless you're already confused by the previous example
how much is zero point two tenths of a percent of now invent a number out of seven
many people are inclined to say
oh zero point two tenths of a percent is the same thing as zero point two tenths
if you see it the same way then it's a mistake
because let's realize that it's not zero point two tenths
it's zero point two-tenths of one percent
you can think about it in two ways
we could say that's zero point two over one hundred which is
if you multiply both the numerator and the denominator of ten
the same thing as two over a thousand
or we use the technique of when we move
decimal point two places left
by which if we start with zero point two tenths and we shift
decimal point two places left we get hopla
oh
hop hop
decimal point comes here
so it's zero point two thousandths
that's the key
zero point two tenths of a percent is the same thing as zero point two thousandths
it may tempt you to make this mistake myself out of inattention I make it
but don't be sad if you ever make it
but there's always leftovers when you see together
decimal number and percent
now that we've figured out how to write the percentages
as a decimal we have to multiply by a number
of which the percentages are calculated
so zero point two thousandths times 7
that's pretty simple now
7 times 2 is 14
how many numbers we have
after decimal point
count
one two three
so we have to have three numbers after the decimal point
so zero point two tenths of a percent of 7 is equal to zero point 14 thousandths
you're probably telling yourself it's
really small number
and that's right because zero point two-tenths of a percent if we think about it
is even less than 1
less than one hundredth
and actually when we think about it zero point two-tenths of a percent is one-fifth of a percent
and if we do the math then one fifth of 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
this number is going to be
it's important to check
it's always good to take the test because
when you're working with decimals and percentages
it's very easy to get lost in decimal places
or produce a multiple of ten
so always take the test
now I'll confuse you even more
what if I say what number is four-twenty percent
from what number
many may blurt out
I take 20
which will be zero point twenty hundredths.
and I multiply it four times
and that would be a mistake
because let's think
I said what 20 out of 4 is not
I said 20 of any number is 4
we're going to do a little algebra now
I bet you didn't expect that in the percentage examples
let's say that x is the number being searched for
and the entry says that 20 of x is equal to 4
I think you already recognize it in this form
how do we write 20 decimal
zero point twenty hundredths or zero point two tenths
and we multiply that times x to get 4
20 is the same thing as zero point two tenths
it's the same thing as zero point twenty hundredths but that last zero
we don't need
zero point two tenths times x is equal to four
and there's a simple linear equation
I bet you didn't see that coming
what to do about it
two views are possible
we can just divide both sides of this equation
coefficient for x
so if we divide zero point two-tenths here and zero point two-tenths here
comes out that x is equal to 4 divided by zero point two tenths of
So let's figure out what 4 divided by zero point two tenths is
hopefully we'll have enough room
zero point two tenths goes into four we write the decimal here
we're going to move the decimal over here
one place to the right
we get 2 and even here we have to move the decimal
one place to the right
02 goes into 4 as many times
as 2 to 40
and that's easy
how many times does 2 go into 40
2 is in four 2 times
and zero goes into 2 zero times
2 is at 40 20 times
2 is at 40 20 times
so 4 divided by zero point two tenths is 20
the answer is 4 is 20 out of 20
and it makes sense
there's more ways to think about it
20 is exactly one fifth
and 4 times 5 is 20
it matches
we can do a test to be sure
we find out what 20 out of 20 is
so 20 out of 20 is like zero point two tenths times 20
and if we calculate that we're going to get 4 as well
so we convinced ourselves that the result was correct
let's try another similar example
selecting numbers randomly
need 3 is 9 of how many
again x is equal to the number of which 3 is 9
you don't have to rewrite it like that
so we knew that zero point nine hundredths x zero point nine hundredths x is the same thing
like 9 of x is equal to 3
or x is equal to 3 divided by zero point nine hundredths
divide by decimal
so we write the decimal point
and a few required zeros
they moved the decimal here two places to the right
we have to move it up two places here as well
009 goes into 3 as many times
as 9 to 300
9 goes into 30 three times
3 times 9 is 27
I think I see a pattern here
thirty-three 3 times 9 is 27
30 will repeat
will still be coming out 3
comes out that 3 is 9 of you can also write
333 periodic also we know that 03
is actually one third
so 3 is 9 out of 33 whole and one third
even that is an acceptable answer
often when we process with percentages
we only look for the approximate result
precision is not so important here
but in this case, we're going to be precise
as well as in tests and there
where needed
hopefully it wasn't very fast and you get a percentage calculation
feel good
in examples with percentages is necessary
watch how they're written
if indicated find 10 out of 100
it's easy
we just convert 10 to the decimal number and multiply it by a hundred
but if the assignment is 100 is 10 of how many
we need to be aware that this is a different example
what number is one hundred and ten and if we count it
it will be out of a thousand
maybe I was talking pretty fast when I was counting percentages
but I hope you're not confused
I'll upload you more examples
you might have heard the term libor when people talk about interest rates
or say I'll lend you money a few percentage points above the libor rate
you'll hear the libor rate quoted on some financial news channels
and it's just the average of the interest rates that banks borrow between themselves
and is calculated by the British Bankers' Association
is actually calculated thomson reuters for the British banking association
exists for some comparison of other types of securities and financial transactions
and literally means London interbank offer rate london interbank offered rate
it's in London it's the rate offered between banks
London interbank offer rate
to understand this a little bit better we have set up two banks here
bank a and bank b and you may already know
that if you go and put your money in the bank
the bank won't keep all that money
the way he makes money is that he lends a good portion of the money to other people as credit
and keeps just enough money at hand
these things you know people could actually come in and claim their money from their current account
we have enough at hand
you can imagine that every now and then a bank gets into a situation where it's short on cash
or it can get close to mandatory minimum reserves
that a country's central bank requires a bank to have
in these situations, let's say a bank and it gets into that situation
said we'll go and borrow some money
we go and borrow money from another bank
this is interbank lending
bank b here is overwhelmed with cash
they say we don't want to hold that much cash
we want to lend it we can actually get interest on cash we don't get interest
maybe a bank b lends money to a bank and
maybe lend as much cash
this is the new cash that the bank got and
right here is the new cash
and of course it's credit
this is a new loan to balance it out remember
that assets are equal to liabilities plus equity
commitments are all here
this is a bank loan b for this cash
have a slightly better reserve
and now the bank's loan b increased and their cash has decreased
this is a loan to a bank and
they took this cash here and gave it to the bank and
and the rate at which they lent it
needed 1 year rate
and of course it's renewed every day it's an overnight rate
this rate is the interbank rate
what they're doing on behalf of the British Bankers' Association
doing research in a number of banks in London
8 12 16 banks in London
they said look at what rate you're all trading
and determine that
determines this as the overnight libor rate
determined it will say 12 across all banks from the survey
but what's interesting about the libor rate is that it's listed in ten currencies
it's not just in sterling dollars
or yen it's in ten currencies
that's what sets it apart from other things
but it really distinguishes it from the actual federal funds rate which is another interbank lending rate
but that's in usa
and more subject to political pressures
the federal bank is actually trying to change that

Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
Our company is called Be Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on the fifteenth of May two thousand and seventeen, and was taken over by the lady here present on the first of September two thousand and eighteen.
We take away clothes and suits made by Czech designers or tailoring workshops.
We pay attention to the quality of materials. Our clothes and suits are made from recycled and natural materials.
We also want to comment on the environmental problems in the fashion industry.
The fashion industry is the biggest polluter.
That means we produce over a hundred and fifty trillion items of clothing, and billions more of clothes are burned or end up in landfills.
In the year two thousand and thirty, there will be an increase in demand in the fashion industry as the amount of the population rises.
The typical cycle of clothing production is to get materials for fabric, fabric manufacturing, fabric weaving, preparation, which to invent means color and pattern, and finally sewing and finishing the garment.
Thank you for your attention, have a nice day.

Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will cost us a lot of money!
They forecast a 5% loss in the first year.

And we definitely got new customers today.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, we got everybody, everybody needs a good night's sleep.

Hi, everybody, my name is <NAME> and I'm your host for today's commercial entry, brought to you by the most well-known operating company coming directly from Austria, Total Regal.
We've dominated the market since nineteen ninety-nine, destroying the dreams of other companies.
So, in fact, our CEO ran this successful organization before either of you were even born.
Think about it.
So, where does our leadership reside?
It's obviously in the mountains.
No, I'm kidding, we have other real cities than just Vienna.
And our dress code?
Miniskirts and leather shorts, no, I'm kidding.
But seriously, maybe we'll change out of our regular clothes for one of the countless parties we throw to get a beer or something.
Okay, more like two beers.
So, why should you buy our products?
We've been selling the most popular stuff, which is really iconic, by the way, since nineteen ninety-nine, so two decades.
Like the Helping Hand, which is the perfect storage space for all kinds of clothes like jackets or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and bags.
So come check out our shop and how we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thanks!
