I have to sit down somewhere.
Did I hear right?
Are you looking for a comfortable chair to sit in and relax in?
You're in the right place at the right time, and I'm probably the right person.
Another annoying salesman who wants to offer his products.
Wait, wait... before you get the wrong picture, let me introduce myself.
My name is <NAME> and I'm the director of New Design World.
Our company was founded in 1981 in northeastern Italy by a group of young people who share a passion for furniture.
Our goal is to produce high quality and sophisticated products, available to a wide range of users.
For example, our comfortable chairs are the perfect combination of beauty and elegance.
Oh, interesting.
Sounds like a good offer.
I was just about to upgrade my office, so carry on.
We would like to offer something that focuses on the customer without forgetting the quality, so we would like to offer our sophisticated products.
And, so...
Would you be interested?
Yes, you talked me into it.
Great!
So now that you've planned out the basis of your office, how about a look at our modern shelves and desks?
They are carefully selected, environmentally friendly and the whole production takes place in Italy, as with all our products.
Oh, what a busy day!
You're right, really challenging!
Do you think it will be worthwhile for us to attend this fair?
Of course!
You know, I don't lack confidence because we sell fashion and trendy products like bed linen and furniture...
People can't resist buying something from us!
And we are young, innovative, creative and all our products are made in Italy: everyone knows that this is a guarantee of high quality.
You're absolutely right, but remember: we're here to make contact with new customers.
Can we apply ourselves in these new markets?
Well, you know, our headquarters are in Veneto and that's an advantage: we're so close to those markets, Eastern Europe is just around the corner!
Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will be expensive!
It will mean a 5% loss in the first year.
Come on, think positive! That five percent will be our third-year profit!
And I'm sure we got new customers today.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, everyone needs a good night's sleep.
Who doesn't need a soft pillow, a comfortable mattress and a warm blanket to sleep on?
And it's all handmade by our skilled craftsmen!
What a dream!
Well, you know, Pillow Dream is the beauty you want and the comfort you need!

Hello, until the 15th.
And you?
The 22nd.
Do you mind if I take my shoes off?
Those high heels are killing me!
Of course.
I won't mind.
Thank you.
Why do you wear those high heels when you can wear sneakers?
I know a good shop that focuses on selling leisure shoes.
Oh, really?
Yes, I actually work for him.
It is called CaspoWalk Ltd. and we offer different types of footwear from different brands such as Nike, Adidas, for all ages and genders.
Do you also offer any special footwear?
Yes, of course.
I can show you some pairs of shoes.
This month's special offer is Danish-style clogs, and if you like sports, you'd like a brand new pair of Nike boots called NikeAdapt BB.
These are smart shoes that you control with your phone.
You can use the mobile app to customise the tying of shoelaces and the colour of LEDs.
If I buy shoes from you, will you offer me some accessories?
Yes, of course.
We offer shoelaces and insoles and many other accessories.
Here's my card.
Be sure to stop by our shop.
Okay, thank you.
You can also find us in this building.
We're attending a student business fair.
Thank you so much!
We got to my floor, so...
Nice to meet you.
Take care.
Nice to meet you, too.
Take care.
Good afternoon, everyone, my name is <NAME>. And my name is <NAME>.
I'd like to introduce you to SETA, which is an acronym: smartphones, electronics and technology accessories.
We are a company that sells electronic devices, such as printers, smartphones and watches.
In addition, we are an international firm that communicates in French, English, Dutch and German.
We came here for the fair and we have special offers prepared for the buyers.
One of the discounts applies to the Instax camera.
When you purchase this camera, you get 100 free photo papers.
It is important to note that we also have quantity discounts on orders over thirty products.
VAT is included in our prices.
Thank you for your time and I hope to see you at our stand, it's number sixty-three.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Hello friends, my name is <NAME> and I'm going to walk you through today's company presentation in which I'm going to introduce the most famous fictional company, straight from Austria, Total Regal.
We have been ruling the market since 1999 and breaking down the dreams of other firms.
In fact, our CEO ran this company before any of you were even born.
Imagine that.
So where does our headquarters reside?
In the mountains, of course.
No, I'm kidding, we actually have other cities than Vienna.
And our dress code?
Short skirts and short leather pants, no, I'm kidding.
In fact, though, we can pull out the traditional outfits for one of the countless parties we throw when we want to have a beer or something.
Well, okay, more like two beers.
So why should you buy our products?
The most popular of our products, which by the way have already become real icons, we have been selling since 1999, two decades ago.
For example, the Helping Hand, which is a great way to store all kinds of clothes, such as jackets, or Spacewonder, where you can store shoes and handbags.
So come and see our shop and as we say in German: "Ihre Zufriedenheit ist uns nicht egal."
Thank you!
So we would like to continue, and I kindly ask the Belgian Court of Auditors to make its presentation.
Okay, I hereby present our current status.
We have two national laws to make European regulation two directives.
One is about paper and digital publications.
Now they have the same rate.
And under certain circumstances, it's a zero rate, but under other circumstances it's six percent.
In the case of letting properties, we have accepted ...the possibility of letting properties ... ... and the mandatory VAT on short-term letting of properties.
Then we did two audits.
One relates to ... , which we have heard several times before, so I will be very brief about it.
The second concerns the system of cash registers.
And then we also have two new four trends.
So our audit on MOS... is not yet complete and is not even published.
Therefore, all the conclusions and recommendations are only preliminary.
But we are almost certain that there will be no more major changes.
Hmmm.
Our conclusions are essentially the same as what we have already heard here today.
But as far as we are concerned, I will just point out some things that are different, but which I think are more or less specific to Belgium.
We currently have only a limited number of staff in the administration because we are more or less a beneficiary, unlike MSID, which transfers money, and we depend heavily on the other Member States.
But in the future, when MOS will expand the most, more staff will be needed.
And they should now be trained and known in advance.
Another general conclusion that we have reached, but which has also been said here, is that there have been changes in control strategies.
What needs to happen is a new direction of thought.
But our administration strongly believes in more MSID, because when we look at conclusions like MSCON...
Just jump from one to the other.
So we see that there is a very poor control strategy.
That is why we strongly believe that every MSID will send or transfer the money.
That's up to us.
However, we have highlighted the importance of making some progress on the control strategy by creating risk profiles.
Our administration has not yet been able to create good risk profiles because they don't have enough data, but they think they will in the future.
I have more data in the future and I could create some risk profiles, so in the future we will monitor whether the control policy will be better.
Another point that is more or less specific.
We track other taxpayers online, so there's a system to find taxpayers online.
But for now, the results are rather bad.
There aren't many things about taxpayers that can be traced.
Then we see that...
The MSIDD registration process is fine as such, but in circumstances where taxpayers are logged out...
There are no follow-up actions if they file a confession in the normal system.
So there is no link or any follow-up system, which we believe is important.
Then we have ... in the process of filing a confession.
There are some automatic checks, which we find very interesting.
So it's not a real check on completeness and correctness (yes, thank you) completeness and correctness.
But it still helps when common mistakes occur.
So the actual checks have to be done by MSCON, but like MSID, but Belgium still helps fill in the returns, so there are some errors.
There will be an alert on the system, or if you have to make a selection and all options are limited, just click on the possible options so there will be fewer errors.
As MSCON, we also found out that they work in Benelux.
So, together with Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they have created a matrix of certain risks and are developing new control activities.
In the function of these risks and there are already two test sets that have started so far.
We therefore recommend working further in this small group to make progress and disseminate knowledge to European forums.
I think it's about the differences we've had as opposed to what we haven't heard before.
So we're going to do a second audit.
An audit of the cash registers system was carried out.
This is not an audit that Luden and I carried out, but that was carried out by other members of the audit cell.
It was also an audit that was slightly wider than just the TV, but I will only present the conclusions and recommendations that are important to the TV.
The audit focused on the effectiveness and efficiency of the control policy.
Installations and applications, so they looked at two problems concerning the system of registration cashiers.
And the impact of the system on the fight against tax fraud.
The conclusions and recommendations they have reached are that the regulation is too complex.
So they recommend simplifying because there are too many exceptions in a regulation, a national regulation.
That it was very difficult to establish a particular group solely on the basis of the statement itself.
And so it was very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that had to install a system of filing cabinets.
Another big conclusion was the control policy.
There are problems with the taxpayer-taxpayer selection of the cash registers system.
When there was a limit, there is a limit. And if the confession is too low, then you fall just below that limit and there is no control anymore, so this was a way to escape the legislation.
There was also a problem with cross-checks of information data from taxpayer collection databases for their control.
Another conclusion was that there were poor internal controls even for the application of the system.
As for the fines that were issued, they found that different control units gave different fines.
There were therefore no rules on fines, but some were very strict and other control teams were not strict at all, or had fines much lower than the rates they gave for certain errors, also risk analysis and an online approach.
It would be an advantage, but it is not implemented now, so the risk analysis was very simple and there is no online access, but once we learned that this kind of system exists in other countries when they have online access.
They found it could be a very good advantage.
Afterwards, there was also an exchange of information with the national social security office, which was not very good.
So a lot of information didn't get from one to the other.
Finally, about the impact of the system.
There was still a problem with entering transactions.
The system as such works very well when used, when used, as it should be used, but when certain transactions were not entered into the system they could not be discovered.
So the solution could be to create a media campaign so that customers can apply for a ticket.
This would ensure that each transaction is entered into the system.
Otherwise it will not be a ticket or that the legislation would be adapted to accepting only electronic payments, because then it would be easier to track money.
But there is no reliable measurement of impact management as a real impact, so they have no idea.
Our team then ran some tests and tried to find an impact, but they found that there was an expectation effect because the system was delayed for several years.
But everyone knew it was coming, so customers and companies were already anticipating legislation that was about to make a change and introduce the system.
The exact differences between VAT receipts before 2016, when the system was introduced and after, were therefore very difficult to trace.
Because already a couple of years before 2016, VAT returns were being scaled up in light of a new system that would be subject to change.
Our team wasn't sure of the effect.
It's just this system or that the effect was even greater because it started earlier than they thought.
Look, I can interrupt, I just, I have a problem, or I'd like to get it right.
What should I think of as a system of cash registers?
Does that mean this cash system is registered somewhere in the database?
No, it's not, it's online, it's a cash register, yeah "casa."
Oh, okay, so it's just for cafes, hotels and restaurants.
It's just for a certain industry.
So far it's only in the Horeca sector and it's a system that registers every transaction or should register every projection that's put into the system.
(So) There is no online access.
That's why the selection of the control group is so important, because the control teams have to go to different places.
They can't focus on it online on a computer, they have to go to HoReCa and connect their computer to the cash register.
To extract data from it and do a check.
Yes, but they can't do it remotely.
They must always drive themselves to the establishment.
So that's when the confession is too low and it's under the limit.
Teams won't go there to see if they know the cafe, for example, and they know there are a lot of customers and they're not there, but that's just a coincidence.
But that's something they didn't find out until later, so it's going to be them.
Thank you, Janet, for your question, because I was afraid I was the only one who didn't understand.
Okay, but then what's the difference between this system that you're talking about registering a cash register at any retailer, I mean in groceries?
So what's so special about this particular system is that you're there.
There's special software that offers any possibility of system fraud, and it's also software that makes sure the data is transferable to the computer of the control teams.
While you can't extract data in the same way with a regular cash register system.
So it's the registry cashier systems that they have.
Yes, they're also special, but there are, I think, five different stamps of registry cashier systems out there that you can choose from and have certification.
That all data that can be extracted in data formats is suitable for analysis by control teams.
Yeah, yes, so compatibility is certified, which is the main domain of different sections.
Yes, you mentioned this risk analysis, that there is no risk service analysis, or they have not all been done or.
I mean online access to this analysis or?
Online access to your own registration cashier system.
Okay, so which ones could checks are much easier, okay, and because we can do automatic checks or data extraction.
Which could be put into a larger system and the risk analysis was actually very basic because they didn't have enough data.
It was also because this audit or system was only introduced in 2016, so they only had two years of data.
Okay, in conclusion.
I have here two new fraudulent trends in our administration.
The first was discovered during an operation called the Matrimony and consisted of registering a large number of foreign companies.
But always by the same two managers, one Russian, one Bulgarian.
But they did register for names that were very similar to familiar names.
There was a difference in only one letter, just so that it could be plausibly assumed that these companies existed, but most of them didn't exist at all.
And then they only filed a VAT return and asked for a VAT refund with fake invoices, but they always did that return in writing and for very small amounts.
Which means the administration had to input all the information into the system, which took time.
Therefore, some refunds had already been made before they could actually establish that there was a possibility of fraud and could check whether the company actually existed and whether those invoices were real.
However, this kind of fraud has been discovered and information about it is already being disseminated through Eurofisc, so I think every tax administration is already aware of this kind of fraud.
Another scam consisted of green energy certificates, which were very similar to earlier certificates for CO3-2.
The fraudulent scheme was more or less the same in that they sent invoices.
Or they used invoices from a firm that looked a lot like a law firm that was otherwise supposed to send invoices.
So we had a scam plan, I shortened it a lot, and I have no picture of it.
But let me put it this way.
There was Company A in Member State X, which according to certificates from B in another Member State A, and sold those certificates to Company C.
Again another Member State Z sent this company an invoice from the corresponding A with a comma...
So that's the name of the company, which differs only one letter from the original.
So Company C wouldn't have seen that fraud was actually taking place.
And of course Company A and Company A with a comma were the same managers who have that Company A, and A with a comma would be the missing trader.
I hope this kind of deception is clear.
And that was the end of my presentation.
If you please.
I would like to ask our Polish colleagues to give their presentation.
Thank you.
And, just to refresh my memory, I would like to say a few words about the new regulations and new instruments that were introduced last year and during this year.
We introduced you to some of them at our plenary session in Warsaw last year.
So those of you who were in Warsaw should know something about it.
So I would briefly remind you of some of them and then I will tell you about our previous audit in this area and our conclusions.
First of all, I would like to mention the single set of audits.
We started implementing these instruments three years ago.
However, last year was the last phase, as the first phase consisted of making the single audit file obligatorily available to the tax authorities upon request.
And now it's an automatic system.
Information must be submitted electronically without any request.
And since July 1 of last year,
This is mandatory for all types of economic operators.
Since 2016.
This was mandatory for larger companies, then for medium, smaller and now for all businesses.
I will also come back to that, because we consider this to be crucial in the fight against VAT cuts.
The second piece of legislation I would like to mention is the so-called 'Fuel Package' and, even in this case, the rule has been introduced gradually.
It depends on the type of business and its main idea is that fuel trading licences are only granted to companies having their registered office in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign companies are declared for VAT, in their countries, the same types of companies can benefit from their procedures for suspending excise duty that respect intra-Community purchases of fuel, and VAT incurred as a result of intra-Community purchases of fuel will have to be paid immediately after dispatch of the goods to Poland or after the suspension of excise duty procedure has been completed.
Another regulation is the transport package.
It must be said that the draft of this law is based on the experience of our Hungarian colleagues.
Because, as we know, the first law of this type was introduced in Hungary and in Poland we introduced this system of tracking the transport of goods only for certain types of certain categories of goods.
Generally, they are goods on which excise duty is levied.
I am referring to fuel, tobacco and some others, and by monitoring I am referring to monitoring how these goods are transported by road or rail.
This means that every single transport has to be reported before the start of transport, in a special system, a dedicated system and, since last year, every transport has also been linked to a geo-location system.
So for each individual truck, you can determine where it is right now.
Roads, car parks, etc.
And the Finance Minister for the Treasury, which is analysing the whole big data system that has been delivered online, some of the public institutions, and so as we know, there may be many results and for many there may be some inconsistencies, and many may have found a business entity providing them with this transport in a way that is abnormal in terms of routes, time, etc.
And we plan to audit the Treasury this year.
How is the Treasury prepared to verify and use these analyses, because the system is in place in the sense that all these companies have to register all traffic and the system is ready in the sense of analysis that is done online.
However, we do not yet know whether the Finance Minister will use this information for any actions carried out by the Financial Authorities.
Another piece of legislation is somewhat similar to what our colleague, who specialises in technical issues, presented yesterday.
So we have a certain blacklist, but in Poland the term blacklist means the list of entities that have been removed from the VAT register.
And we have an information-based system, relaunched by online banks and other financial system entities.
This system can be used by the Minister of Finance to identify any discrepancies and problems, and this system is aimed at capturing unusual transactions and providing financial authorities with information about them online.
And based on that information, the IRS can block an account, a bank account and a specific transaction.
What is the risk that some higher fine than, say, €10,000 will be enforced?
Another piece of legislation is the distribution of payments, which was introduced last year.
It's optional at the moment.
But it really depends on the buyer.
If one contractor uses it, then the method of payment is obligatory for the contractor, of course.
Importantly, if this payment distribution mechanism is used, then joint and several liability of the taxpayer is excluded.
I'll show you some numbers and in a little while I'll tell you about how this distribution can be used in the payment mechanism.
Finally, here is one legislative and organisational tool that was presented in some detail last year by our colleague from the Treasury.
So we have a new national revenue administration here, based on the previous free administration, and now we have another administration fighting tax and customs in one system.
On top of that, an online registration system.
Ha ha ha.
At the moment, we have a mandatory type of registration cashier system and the mandatory element of these registration cashiers is electronic memory.
The Financial Conduct Authority is therefore able to verify authorised types of registration cash registers based on memory, but we are starting with an online system registration system for only some sectors.
These are first and foremost legal services, medical services, only some specific sectors.
The implication is that we need to start working towards a central system, headed by the head of the national revenue administration.
In this system, all such transactions should be immediately and simply registered online.
And that is why we are embarking on this discussion, so that we can introduce any distribution of payments for all taxpayers affected.
This effectively means that we would like the tax authorities to wish to replace the reverse charge with this payment and reverse charge mechanism and joint and several liability.
Thus, in all sectors where the devolved tax liability or joint and several liability is binding, all these sectors could be covered by this payment distribution mechanism.
Now, as I said before, let me tell you something about our audit.
We did the audit last year.
The period for which the audit was carried out was quite long - it was 12 years, which is why we were asked by the Public Finance Committee of the same Polish Chamber of Parliament to carry out such an audit.
We have come to the following conclusions.
We have had to state that the efficiency of the Treasury's work has been highly volatile over this long period.
Between 2010 and 2015, the Ministry and the tax authorities, in our opinion, made somewhat inadequate efforts to improve their efficiency in the field of VAT revenue.
As the subject of the audit was the Treasury's supervision of tax revenue, or the collection of taxes, specifically the collection of VAT, this is where it manifested itself.
One of the signs of this said volatility in labor efficiency is
so-called VAT GAP.
And during those years, VAT GAP in Poland averaged 24 percent, which was about ten points higher than the median EU country.
Among other things, we concluded that the oversight had not been effectively contacted.
So that's it.
It can be stated that we have information about the VAT GAP in Poland and EU countries and that we have numbers from the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of Finance.
And as you can see, the average VAT GAP differential in Europe is certainly lower than in Poland; even if we don't take into account the source of the information, the figures are quite clear.
Mmmm.
I have already spoken about the fact that our main tool and the main tool of financial authorities, as well as the idea that was being put into practice during this period, was a single set of audits, and over the last two years financial authorities have acquired the competence to use databases to analyse them .
For example, in 2017, four million invoices were automatically analysed, but only 3,300 alerts were issued based on these analyses.
Last year, the number of invoices subjected to analysis did not increase much - it was about five million, but the analysis yielded more than 350,000 warnings.
This was reflected in the revenue, as the first stage is automatic analysis and then comes a warning sent via text or email.
So without any official action in the tax proceedings, etc.
And this system, or its first phase, the automatic phase, has brought us additional revenue, VAT receipts worth more than EUR 150 million a year.
I am talking about the figures for 2017 and 2018.
It should be noted that the revenue increase occurred in good economic conditions and the improvement of VAT collection, which was the result of a large package of legislative and organisational changes introduced in recent years.
Yet we are of the opinion that one of the main sources of these results, these financial results, is precisely the introduction of this single set of audits.
As a result of another instrument, this payment distribution mechanism in 2018 was followed by the use of a payment distribution mechanism which, as I have already said, was optional.
However, we observe an increased interest in making payments in this way.
In July last year, taxpayers carried out 600,000 transactions.
In December, more than one and a half million transactions were made using the split payment mechanism.
The value of the tax paid through this split payment mechanism in July was half a billion euros.
And half a billion euros as of December 1.
In total, over seven million transactions were carried out by taxpayers using the payment allocation mechanism between July and December last year, and the amount of tax on special VAT accounts amounted to around six billion euros.
And one more thing about the work of the tax authorities, last year the tax authorities and the ministry carried out 30 percent fewer checks than in 2017, but with fewer checks, the percentage of checks found to be irregular increased.
In our view, this is the result of new electronic tools in place which have helped to better select the bodies for which checks should be carried out.
It is clear that the reduction in the number of checks has been achieved by the fact that the reduction in the number of checks has been accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is clearly less painful and time-consuming for taxpayers.
This led to a 100 percent increase in findings last year compared to 2017.
So, in general, we believe that a number of legislative instruments have been put in place over the past couple of years.
Taken together, the results are sufficient.
In doing so, however, we must not forget that this was done in economically favourable conditions.
So it's not entirely possible to determine what portion of that increased revenue was due to which factor.
If this is the result of new organisational and legislative instruments
or if the overall economic situation is responsible.
That's all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions, please ask.
Do you have any other questions?
If not, I would like to ask the floor of our Romanian colleagues.
Okay, good day.
Can you all hear me right?
Yes?
So we have had 19 percent VAT in Romania for two years.
And although there were plans to cut to eighteen per cent, they were put on hold for the time being.
In addition, we have two reduced VAT rates, nine per cent and five per cent.
There have been several changes over the past year in terms of products that may have a reduced rate.
The biggest change, that is, the sewer service, where the rate was cut from nineteen per cent to nine per cent starting on the first of January of this year.
Other items remain unchanged.
By contrast, there have been many changes to the 5 per cent rate, mainly for some products that were at 9 per cent and have now been reclassified to 5 per cent.
The biggest change was most recently on 1 June this year; this change concerned high-quality food and mountain products, as well as traditional products.
And for products made in the mountains, the cows or sheep that produce them must live there for at least half of their lives.
The producer must get them a licence, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
He will then be able to apply a reduced rate.
Then there is the reverse charge mechanism.
In Romania, both companies must be registered in order to use the system.
There are fourteen products for which this can be shortened, and in December two thousand and eighteen had to be for some of which the deadline is extended until twenty-two.
Finally, the Value Added Tax distribution system, which was introduced in the year two thousand and seventeen, although it now looks as if the Treasury has somewhat forgotten it.
For in the year two thousand and seventeen it began with more than four hundred companies, and now in the year two thousand and nineteen their number has fallen to forty-six per cent.
In addition, in the year two thousand and eighteen, no new companies started using the system.
So all the companies that started with it have since started to go back from this system to the normal VAT system.
In addition, the European Commission has ordered Romania to stop using the system.
It therefore appears that the system has not fulfilled what was expected of it, so the ministry is likely to stop using it altogether.
Completely?
I am based on the data available to us because no new companies were registered in the year two thousand eighteen or the year two thousand nineteen.
So there are only companies in the system that started in the year two thousand and seventeen, and their numbers are slowly decreasing.
As far as all these findings are concerned, there are still some regulatory gaps as regards the MOSS system, which in Romania is for some reason referred to as M1SS because it has been translated.
But that's the way it is.
In addition, we lack IT systems at financial offices that can work together and exchange data with each other.
Which will not make things any easier for companies, and last year we finally introduced an electronic system like the one they have in Belgium.
They have put in place electronic cash registers and companies are now obliged to start using them, so the tax authorities are checking that all companies have them installed.
For the moment, however, we are not sure whether the system is fully operational due to the limits in the IT system of financial authorities.
And so far, no new trends have been identified.
So, that would be all.
Thank you.
Okay, so we did this audit.
The audit report will be published on 16 July.
Therefore, keep this information secret.
They are under an information embargo until the date of publication.
We await the Commission's response in all 23 official EU languages.
Because we only have an answer in English, so it's just a formality and the audit is now behind us.
The title was 'Many Challenges...' and the special report will read 'There are many challenges remaining in collecting VAT on customs duties'.
That remains to be resolved.
This was originally meant to be "There will be a need to look at" but some have already been addressed to some extent through new legislation, a new Commission proposal that just mentioned <CENSORED>.
But there are still problems that remain to be solved, and we will see about that later.
So I'll start with why we chose this audit topic.
What are we looking at?
They're looking for something.
And we will conclude with our recommendations.
First, ok, we did a survey because we follow up on previous research analyses.
Based on the findings of the head of these institutions in the field of e-commerce, German colleagues, Lithuanian colleagues carried out audits.
Also, in the previous decision we made on imports, we analyse the issue of distance from non-EU countries and the related issues relating to VAT and customs duties and decided that it was worth going deeper during this audit.
The problem is that honest traders are often excluded from the market by dishonest traders and can no longer compete.
This is a problem that has also been raised by representatives of the academic community, such as Professor Rita de la Feria, and is particularly intense in the UK.
Loss estimates, too.
There are only estimates of distances from outside the EU.
However, these estimates are not very encouraging, because even though the commission estimates only five billion a year, in the UK it is between £1 billion and £1.5 billion a year.
This is how they estimated the losses.
This represents an 8 to 10% reduction in UK VAT.
But be careful, because the fight against fraud currently only accounts for four per cent.
So the triple of the fight against fraud in the UK is the volume of losses in e-commerce of goods bought from third countries.
This is the mission.
We are not counting distance sales within the EU, we are not counting most electronic services.
So the bottom line is to highlight our concerns.
Then what we are focusing on is visiting five Member States - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we took into account the number of registrations to the MOS both in non-EU and US programmes.
Also the volume of electronic sales within the EU and, finally, the estimated amount of VAT lost as a result of the VAT exemption on imports of negligible goods (LVCR).
Following a study by our source at the commission, we also visited the commission.
These steps should debug the technology and the World Customs Organisation, and the cancellation period lasted from 2015 to the end of 2018.
However, we have also taken into account the new legislation on the proposal submitted and all the proposals that will come into force in 2021.
What are we focusing on?
We have, of course, begun to analyse the responses to our survey, a survey sent by the main group of two.
We continue with a questionnaire in all the Member States we have visited with interviews with all sorts of people.
We have gained access, and what is also very important, we have set up access to ABC data to the Synergia database, i.e. the database of incidents, problems that Member States report in the MOS.
We have been given access to all fiscali (fiscal) and e-commerce related project groups and to all BUT related project groups, where there is a lot of information and discussion about the functioning of the MOS.
And, of course, we got funding from the support of institutions from Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and we ended up doing our own samples of different transactions.
Overall, we have put together almost nine hundred e-commerce-related transactions.
What we find, of course, were first positive things and then we'll continue with the most negative.
The regulatory framework is governed by the best international practices at the extremes of the OECD and the World Customs Organisation.
In most respects relating to the OECD, the principle of taxation at the place of destination has been respected in most cases, with the exception of this principle.
There is now a new threshold of under ten thousand euros that you can lodge in the Member State of origin, so it is not in line with the OECD.
In the case of the World Customs Organisation, which deals with imported packages, the Instant Release Guidelines have been followed in most respects, as well as a new proposal within the standards.
The Commission is a pioneer in this area and in most respects is adapting to the World Customs Organisation and standards.
As for the new provision, which will come into force in 2021...
I am trying to resolve some weaknesses, but for us the main problem that will continue to occur is undervaluation.
Losses from VAT and customs duties are experience and will continue to be.
And this cannot be addressed by proposing an information chain with payment service providers.
As for trade with non-EU countries, this will not be resolved and we will also see why later.
Why yes, because administrative cooperation agreements with third countries do not work.
We have a new agreement with Norway.
We expect a change of information with Norway that it will work, but that is not a problem.
It's not Norway, the problem is China, it's the United States of America.
The information chain with China doesn't work because the Chinese counterpart doesn't respond and the response rate goes down and down and down, so that's the problem.
If we have information about a change of supplier that doesn't work using the electronic interface, i.e. works directly on its website that didn't register in the MOS or even registered and after we cancel the registration, he opens a new website...
So, how come we pay VAT from Europe to China, and we expect VAT to go back to the EU.
Unless we also have the cooperation of the administration.
That will never happen.
This is also a problem among EU countries, it does not work as expected.
Also administrative cooperation, so we will see later that the checks carried out by national tax authorities are weak.
Because there are virtually no tools to carry out a proper analysis of the risk of chance that we have already mentioned.
It will therefore be necessary for a Member State to approve the Commission's proposal to amend the information, with payment service providers subject to scrutiny by the Commission being inadequate.
And we'll see later, of course, that the commission did not carry out any monitoring, any monitoring on that.
There are weaknesses in the check-in's own electronic systems.
The traditional problem, of course, is that traders undervalued goods to be below the euro threshold of twenty-two or ten years for VAT.
And that will disappear in the future, but they will continue to undervalue to pay less VAT.
It will not be approved, but they will pay less and as far as customs duties are concerned, the presumption is set at a hundred and fifty euros and they cannot cope.
Because in all electronic ... we will see the EU electronic clearing system later, they cannot stop the declaration.
Because they tick the box they own electronically, which they apply to the customer electronically for relief purposes.
And they pushed the system, even though they declared a value that was above a hundred and fifty.
The electronic system can't stop it, they said it was something very serious because the operators who work there are promising economic operators.
So, the big couriers have the authority of the Economic Operators Association and claim to be the most reliable, but they are abusing the system.
Promoting the collection of customs duties for VAT is not effective.
Ok, provisions on the chain of information on the recovery of claims related to this tax.
They were rarely used, out of the five Member States we visited, only in Austria.
Only in five cases, so it's not often used.
We are analysing the discrepancy of payments between Member States.
We have access to the harmonisation carried out by the commission and there are still omitted combinations.
Important means a lot between Member States.
In the Netherlands, of course, the problem is that they cannot harmonise, which explains the amounts of VAT received with the VAT return.
And there are also problems with the reminders that even our colleagues from the SAO yesterday...
They anticipated a problem with Member States' comments on consumption, which are not ...
Here is a summary of our findings regarding MOS samples.
We have come to the conclusion that MOS IT infrastructure is fit for purpose, so it is strong.
It can be done by the user, so the IT infrastructure is solid, but there are registration and payment problems between Member States.
For example, when it comes to the analysis of the occurrence reported in Synergy, the Synergy database between Member States, but there are only a few twenty-two cases in five Member States.
Which we reviewed in which Member State with already the origin of the problem and as an influencing Member State.
There were only 12 cases, so there weren't that many cases, the problem is that the attitude of the Member States was really passive.
It wasn't until the problems escalated that they started working on it, but it takes a long time to solve the problems.
As for MOS, it takes long periods, but there are not many problems.
Also, in terms of technical error messages sent and received between Member States, the response is also very passive, not proactive only when the problem escalates as an incident to which they begin to respond.
But this infrastructure for MOS is robust.
We have assessed whether they are ready for a single point of contact.
This is something else. We have received several complaints, especially from Austria.
They say they won't be ready, even from a Dutch trip that we haven't analysed, because the system is being developed especially to order using a one-stop shop for import.
The registration issues are here.
We need to differentiate within the system outside the US and the EU system, only eighty per cent of registrations have not been properly checked.
As for the known system outside the US and we even found it, we found cases of double registration, which is something serious, then in terms of payments, the problem is particularly the problem of missing reminders in the Member State of consumption.
And sometimes by the Member State of identification.
And problems with registration and deregistration.
This is the most related administrative cooperation, it is an exchange of information between the Member States we have visited.
And here we compare with the overall activity of the information chains that we see, for example, there are total information requirements that have been sent to one hundred and eighty-two compared to total information requirements.
It is generally unrelated to the normal nine thousand two hundred, so even in the UK many of them will not be more problematic, for example three times more problematic.
The level of the information chain is good, it is very low, and also some Member States have not changed, which is not why we recommend separating the centralised CNO home office.
A separate structure designed for e-commerce, or at least for MOS, so the level of information transfer is very weak.
Then we have multilateral controls, in two cases there were six cases of multilateral controls.
It was a really successful experience.
However, in two cases this was not successful at all as the Member State of identification refused to participate in the multilateral control.
This is something that should be resolved by enforcing the new legislation, because now two Member States can ask to carry out a check.
And another is the recent request that the other Member State of identification cannot refuse such participation.
So hopefully it will improve, but there are other significant things for Eurofisc.
There were four hundred and eighty signals, the chain through Eurofisc works for e-commerce a full five, and only one feedback regarding these four hundred and eighty.
So the Member State didn't find this information very useful, they don't know why only five Member States were chosen, they put seniors in the database.
And others didn't read it because they didn't find the information very useful.
So there are also a few signals about trends or themes of fraud, three or four themes that they find useful.
And then there are the changing tools for web crawling, but that's something that some members are taking over legally in their country.
In other Member States, internal legislation prevents them from using web crawling tools.
Now the work file is frozen and the frozen activities are not useful.
They are waiting for a proposal for an information chain between the payment service provider.
Because they will be, they will be databases and they will have access.
This is the Commission's proposal for all information provided by the payment service provider to any other country, the Commission's proposal.
Of course we are very supportive and put the proposal in the report, but I didn't know until I asked yesterday that the Commission needed some support for this proposal too, because Lubik Lubis said there were problems.
However, I took this for granted in the council because this proposal comes from some discussion in some forums with the Member States and with stakeholders.
Hopefully... this is very important because another problem is the lack of controls, audits for the IOC.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here that it's nobody, because it's never how can I, if not, I don't know that I don't have an analysis of data areas.
So my audit is going to be a random selection with maybe a lot of information and no records, so they're going to need some data and this is the data.
In addition, the company will have many more applications.
Yeah, they seem to understand about Germany because we have the data.
A team outside the U.S., but information he may have.
Phenomenon.
But I don't know further, beyond that there is virtually no control.
Controls on knowledge of intra-EU distances have also not been very successful.
The customs office therefore has the results of a sample from a courier for abuse of postal services.
At the post office, the main problem in dealing with the issue of undervaluation is you have drones very expensive drones declared under ten units or under twenty-two euros.
Samples like this are a thousand times as simple.
And they can read, and it's very difficult to handle at post office level.
And for a courier, they abuse the usual relief of a hundred and fifty, because they just tick the box to take over and fifty can't close then.
A statement to stop the declaration, even if a devaluation of more than a hundred and fifty, we check that not only in the sample, but also directly in the custom electronic system in the dam environment, where we have done several experiments.
Member States did not work in any Member State, only in Austria did it work.
But he didn't receive it in Austria.
We have made another declaration on alcohol.
And then for alcohol, it was enforced, and because that categorization is applicable to alcoholic products.
So there are some flaws in the Austrian system.
This problem is therefore an approved economic operator exploited by the most reliable custom traders.
We also have a recommendation for the Commission to use the structures provided in mutual assistance treaties with non-EU countries.
To solve these problems, solve the problems, find out the lack of answers.
Also inspect Member States' checks at local level on relief.
At a minimum, monitor the functioning of distance selling within the EU, mixed goods this recommendation is the only one not adopted by the Commission.
That's why they laughed yesterday, because your job is
Monitor the commission and <CENSORED 22:25> said: "Yes, yes, yes."
I laughed, but okay.
They help the Member State develop a methodology for estimating the VAT gap for newcomers.
Because this is a problem, we can't know whether the system works or not.
Most schemes are expected to be successful, but this is usually an assumption, which is why we have an estimate of the largest VAT gap.
We do not know whether the system is successful and we have no estimate for the European Union itself, so that would be very important.
As the Commission assists Member States in their development, this is a calculation of the VAT gap.
It is also very important to explore the use of alternative solutions.
There could perhaps be assistance in the form of an alternative payment distribution system to tackle VAT fraud.
Using blockchain technology, pathways are proposed, KPMG, KPMG, as well as Professor E. Ensworth's proposal.
There are some very interesting proposals that we have discussed with the commission, of course, and the commission says that they are theoretical, practically coming up with solutions.
In fact, they have not found a practical application, Professor Lamas has also put forward several proposals to use the technology for imports from outside the EU.
But this system is accepted by many other countries.
There's no practical experience, but I think, we think it's also worth going deeper with blockchain technology offering opportunities.
This is something that is also being examined by the committee for the management of the database of important convenience stores.
Numbers to manage the validity of these numbers.
It is very important who that is, the future, the only way to deal with the use of the name of the new technology for the Member States.
We like, of course, that they are starting to respond to fraudulent seniors and are adjusting Eurofisc.
Also follow the compromise in line with the new €10,000 threshold.
This is something that Czech colleagues have highlighted in their report.
And we also took that into account for the reason they explained earlier.
To have a separate MOS and a long-distance coordination function with colleagues, we need to ensure that the trader can introduce a VAT rate, the right VAT rate in MOS VAT returns.
Because when a trader introduces a bad VAT rate, they only receive advice, but the return can be sent the same way, so they receive advice, but it will still be sent.
Also, do the necessary post-registration checks at MOS to avoid this double registration problem.
Increase audit work for most MOS traders and distance sellers with administrative cooperation tools.
Employee of regular VAT estimates in e-commerce.
So if for this recommendation to the Member States, we would be very grateful if you would remember in your home country the importance of adhering to our recommendations.
That is why we are seeking your cooperation on this matter, and that is all we know if you have any questions.
I now give the floor to Mr Maybrerle.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
It is a great honour for me to be able to speak here.
I will try to brief you here with our big data tool, which we have been using at the Austrian Court of Auditors for three years.
So before I really start, I would like to inform you about the situation in Austria's largest municipalities.
These are municipalities with more than ten thousand inhabitants, and since the year two thousand and eleven, we have the power to control all these local governments.
Before that, the limit was twenty thousand.
So the gray points represent more than twenty thousand inhabitants, and the blue ones less than twenty thousand.
The explanation is still in German.
Sorry about that.
In total, we are therefore entitled to audit seventy-five municipalities.
This represents about 3.2 percent of the total number of municipalities.
However, we provide advice to all Austrian municipalities.
For this reason, in our department, we have decided to develop a special tool that we call the Municipal Monitoring Tool.
The development team consists of three young economists who work in our department. I am one of them.
All three of us use this tool for different purposes.
So what was the purpose of this tool, why was this tool created in the first place?
The main reason was to try to find an analytical tool for assessing financial risk.
So first we try to design a profile for each municipality.
Considering all the relevant factors.
In a second step, we assess the municipalities with regard to their importance for the audit activities of the current Austrian Court of Auditors.
Finally, we rank municipalities according to financial risk based on certain indicators.
The order is always interesting, it is the most interesting thing about all of this because it gives us the opportunity to compare all the municipalities.
Thank you.
So the hardest task of any database project is collecting quality data.
We heard about it a day earlier.
In this context, we must mention that we are greatly helped by the data of Statistics Austria, which is the Austrian Statistical Agency, and this agency is our most important partner in this project.
We got the following data from them.
This data is actually available to every citizen.
However, if you want aggregated data, you have to buy it from Statistics Austria.
And only aggregated data is useful for analysis.
So we have cross-cutting accounts of budgets and accounting regulations.
We have detailed information about closed accounts, so we have accounts at the level of free tickets.
And then we have statements of debt and liabilities.
So we use mainly financial and accounting data, but of course we have separate population data and other data that come from Statistics Austria.
Now we have data from this period from year two thousand eight to year two thousand thirteen.
And that's a mistake, for which I apologize.
We constantly update this data, every autumn.
Because we have data from municipal accounting systems, we have no data on municipal contributions, we have no data on rental obligations, nor do we have any data on balances and assets because municipalities do not publish these data.
This is important because in practice you have an official accountant in the municipality, you find out some amount of debt and if you look at the contributions of the companies to the municipality, it may be that you find this value of debt again here, so it will be a duplication and if you just check the accounts of the municipality itself, you only have half.
So from the existing data, we think our indicators are good, which I will explain later, and we will try to create an indicator model and this monitoring is based on a model that consists of indicators that are compiled as evaluation indicators broken down by topic.
From this, statistics are derived from one to 100, which is most relevant to the audit.
This model therefore allows indicators to be evaluated according to specific themes.
And in order to determine audit relevance, the Austrian Court of Auditors uses financial situation indicators as a basic setting, but depending on the issue raised, depending on the audit topic, you can choose a different setting of indicators.
Then you get a different result.
The indicator model therefore consists of four themes and the first is the financial situation in the long term.
That means we take net debt plus liabilities minus holdings of securities and minus reserves.
So the first one gives us a long-term perspective, that is, debt minus assets.
And the other one gives us a short-term perspective.
Which is... yes, please.
In the short term, we define the basic balance, which is current revenue excluding transfers minus current expenditure excluding transfers and pensions.
This is an important point in the indicator model, because we do not use the key figures I have expressed per capita.
We use a different figure as a relevant number, namely our own revenues, because it is better to show the economic strength of the community.
Next comes the administrative structure.
That's where we simply put together administrative expenses and personal expenses.
Personal data is the most challenging task for us.
We tried to assess the quality of accounting systems.
And, yes, we take into account other accounts, different accounts, representation expenses and special account analysis.
This means that we are trying to find accounting errors using this data.
This image is therefore a screenshot of one possible output of the monitoring tool
And you see communities that are at the bottom of the list, from the best to the worst.
The black column therefore indicates the value and this is in view of the importance of audit activities for the Austrian Court of Auditors. In this figure, it is therefore assessed for the importance of audit for our departments.
So the four columns on the right are the indicators.
Indicators of the model I explained before.
The black column gives a value of three point thirty-three, which is the village of Halvank, a small village near Salzburg and is the best municipality.
So this is a benchmark.
So if you want to audit the municipality with the best financial position in the best financial situation, we will audit Halvank.
If you would like to audit the worst village, just skip the picture and drive to the last one, but today I don't want to show you these communities.
We have all Austrian municipalities in our system, but not every municipality falls under our metering obligation, so only the second, yes we can audit only the second.
We try to compare municipalities with the same class of municipalities of the same size, so we don't compare Vienna with Halvanko. We try to find similar municipalities to make the comparison fair.
So we have many different output options for this tool, and another feature is this output journal for each individual municipality.
So we have the village of Halvank, for example.
We can do such a diary for every municipality in Austria and you will not be able to read it, as you can see, but it will give us a whole range of key figures, indicators, graphs and information about the financial situation and its development.
Another output of the journal is these two pages, where for example you can see on the left an analysis of personal expenses, it's that red line of the graph.
And when comparing with other municipalities, you can choose the blue line, and where the red line crosses the blue line, the municipality is worse.
Or
So you can easily judge whether the municipality has excessive spending.
And on the right-hand side we have transfers, which means we have outgoing and incoming money from the community perspective.
But these are only two outputs out of many.
We currently use some statistical programs, such as R Stat Plus, and we can do whatever analysis is necessary - which our superiors want us to do.
As you can see, we use this tool for audit planning, for preparation, for operational matters and on-demand, that is, if someone wants to use this community just for presentation, they can use that journal.
If you want to know which municipalities are worse in the region, we can do it and this information helps us not only in the audit itself.
And in line with our advisory approach, we provide substantive information to municipalities.
This means that if a mayor calls us and wants to know about his community and what their financial situation is in this community, we can provide them with overviews and a diary.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
<CENSORED>, are you receiving?
Shall I begin?
Yes.
Right, ha ha ha, I'm sorry.
First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your conference on electronic data.
The right to access government information is a fundamental democratic right.
This requires the government to share public information.
Since the law came into force, the company has changed a lot.
Information is no longer stored on paper, but in dynamic computer systems.
Over time, virtually all people began using the Internet, often on multiple devices.
The twenty-first century government can respond to these tasks by giving the public direct access to government information.
In other words, the government could actively publish open data.
In that case, the volume of open data has to be considered in the context of the digital governance transition.
The pace in this area is set here by the UK, along with the US.
These countries clearly do not view open data as an objective, but as a means to achieve greater transparency.
They are world leaders in terms of open government partnerships.
This is an initiative to make the government as open as possible.
And there are several European directives and treaties in Europe that are important for open data legislation and policy.
The Dutch government, too, has considerable ambitions in the area of open data and has adopted new rules.
But actual implementation is still in its infancy.
The Dutch Court of Auditors and its former chairwoman, Ms Stuiveling, see great potential in open data.
In 2013, we decided to monitor the development of open data in the Netherlands.
In our first report, we focused on the definition of open data and the state of open data in the Netherlands.
We have conducted a survey focused on the commitment of ministries to an open data policy.
Our approach is positive because we have concentrated on ministries that have done well and, on the contrary, we have tried to encourage ministries that have fallen behind.
Through meetings with open data experts and civil servants and the publication of factsheets with good examples at national and international level.
In the second report, we stressed the importance of open data and monitored progress.
We have identified several potential benefits of open data.
Open data offers opportunities for the government.
By openly reporting on its spending and performance, the government will have a better idea of its own funding.
This will change the way Parliament oversees the government.
Open data sets would increase transparency and accessibility of government for citizens.
From a business perspective, innovative entrepreneurs can convert open data into new applications.
One of our goals was to find out what the Netherlands could learn from the UK and the United States.
Using data for an open data biometer performed by the World Web Foundation, we compared three aspects of open data.
Awareness of delivering positive results from government open data initiatives.
The extent to which open data are available.
And the impact on society, the economy and government.
Um, society, economy and government.
And if we compare... excuse me.
Excuse me.
My voice is kind of hooked up in the monitor.
It disturbs me a lot.
All right.
We can continue.
If we compare Great Britain and the United States with the Netherlands,
This is based on the UK and US in terms of implementation and impact better.
There is little difference in their readiness for open data.
The Netherlands, on the other hand, is significantly worse prepared.
This only applies to the right to information and the extent to which the government supports open data initiatives.
In terms of availability, the UK and the United States publish much more open data than the Netherlands.
The number of open data sets is huge in the United States.
The type of data that countries publish varies in number of points.
The Netherlands currently publishes little open data on government spending and public procurement.
The Dutch business register is not very open either.
As you can see, by contrast, the UK has open data in all areas.
The impact of open data has a political, social and economic dimension.
In social and economic terms, the Netherlands lags behind both the UK and the United States.
This means that the Netherlands makes less use of open data to involve citizens in the design and control of government policy.
The economic benefits of open data are very small.
In both of our reports, we have given international examples that can set a good example for the Netherlands.
And in Sweden, for example, municipalities and regions publish detailed tables on hospital waiting times.
We didn't rely solely on open data barometers.
and we did our own research.
And to get a better idea of the currently available volume and type of open data
We looked at the data published on our national open data portal.
In all, three thousand two hundred data sets were available in February, two thousand and fifteen.
And slightly more than half of the data sets were provided by the central government.
Most of the open data published by the central government comes from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
And by far the most important source of open data in the Netherlands is the ministry's public works.
In the case of our two reports, we asked all ministries what steps they were taking to publish open data.
The scores we gave to each ministry were based on six indicators.
These included support from the ministry's management and the entity's action plan.
Since the publication of our first report, some ministries have taken exceptional initiatives to publish open data.
We also asked the ministries how many people and what funds they provided in the year two thousand and fourteen.
Their answers were very different.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Security and Justice had neither the time nor the money to publish public data.
However, other ministries have mandated the disclosure of open data to several workers and have released the budget for these activities.
On the basis of examining the years two thousand thirteen and fourteen, we have concluded that open data is the standard, but it is not yet being applied in practice.
And given what was enacted in the field of open data, it was mostly about the government, what the government knows, rather than what the government is doing.
We also got some comments that rely on the success of the open data policy.
And the government should be better informed about what data is available.
They should create the right conditions, the right conditions for open data.
And the third was that the government had to invest in both; on both the supply and demand sides of open data.
For example, by establishing an open data institute.
For our report for the year two thousand and fifteen, we found that the government and ministries had taken steps towards a wider acceptance of open data.
And partly in response to our first report on open data, the Home Office is currently coordinating the entire government's analysis of the data set.
The Netherlands follows the good examples set by the UK and the United States.
There was a downside.
We also found that the open data provided through the national portal was one-sided.
Virtually all open data sets are geo data, geographic data, and almost all are published by one ministry.
Very little data is important which is important for the public control of government finances and government activity is available.
In most of our conclusions, we believe that the following point should be taken into account for the development of the Dutch open data policy.
The Dutch government should therefore define targets and milestones in a specific action plan.
We also think that data opening should be mandatory.
And the government should develop a national information infrastructure.
This should determine which data is of the greatest social importance and which data should in any case be made available.
And the government should use open data itself, for example in decentralising social networks.
In the Netherlands, it is a major national programme under which responsibility is transferred from central government to municipalities.
Our reports have had a positive impact.
The Home Office will publish the results of a national survey of data this month.
The House of Representatives adopted a proposal for a national information infrastructure.
And based on the data inventory, the Home Office will set up a national open data agenda.
In this agenda, they will disclose what data will be opened and when it will be opened.
We try to lead by example.
We have published our own expenses on our website so that everyone can see what the Dutch Court of Auditors is spending its money on.
Such a form of financial transparency is called open spending.
The Treasury Department now plans to make detailed spending data available to the government next year.
All right.
As you have seen, the movement of open data in the Netherlands is developing positively and the Dutch Court of Auditors will continue to monitor developments.
Thank you for your attention.
If you are interested, you can find our reports on our website in English and our spending data in Dutch.
We have a role Devon is going to do 3 shelves for
My father.
It has a piece of board that is 12 metres long.
He wants the top shelf to be half a meter shorter than
middle shelf
I'll do it in different colors.
So he wants the top shelf to be half a meter shorter than
middle shelf
I'll read the whole assignment first.
and the bottom shelf should be half a meter shorter than twice the length
top shelf
Select a different color
I'll do it in blue.
The bottom shelf will be half a metre shorter than double.
Top shelf lengths
how long individual shelves will be if
It uses an entire 12-metre board.
Let's mark variables with different shelf lengths.
Because that's what we have to calculate.
We have a top shelf and a middle shelf.
And the bottom shelf.
So let's say t denotes the length of the top shelf.
t denotes the length of the top shelf
and m will correspond to the length of the middle shelf
M stands for middle shelf.
a b will denote the length of the bottom shelf
b is the bottom shelf
Now let's find out what these different statements tell us.
So the first statement says that Devon wants to have a top shelf.
I use the same color, I want the top.
a shelf half a metre shorter than the middle shelf
So he wants the length of the top shelf to be
half a metre less than the length of the middle shelf
we have all the variables in meters so we can write
Middle shelf length minus
12 meters
This is what the orange underlined sentence tells us.
The top shelf must be 12 metres shorter than the length.
middle shelf
So what does the next statement tell us?
and the bottom shelf must be
12 metres shorter than
double the length of the top shelf
So it's 12 meters less than double that.
Top shelf lengths
These are both statements written down.
using equations
The length of the top shelf is equal to the length of the middle shelf.
Minus 12.
It is 12 metres shorter than the middle shelf.
and the bottom shelf must be 12 metres shorter than
double the length of the top shelf
So how do we solve this?
Well, only with these two equations to solve it.
We can't, but there's more information in the assignment.
We have entered here how long the individual shelves will be if
Devon uses a whole 12-metre board.
So the length of all the shelves has to.
be together 12 meters
It needs everything to produce.
So t plus m plus b has to be 12 meters.
These are the lengths of each of the shelves.
And she uses a total of 12 meters of board.
So the sum of the plank lengths has to be 12 meters.
So what can we do about it?
Well, we can express everything depending on one variable.
We'll express that depending on m and then subtract them.
We already have an addiction to it.
We can replace all those in the equations.
Relationship with minus 12.
But here b is dependent on t
how it can express it depending on m
Well, we know that t is equal to m minus 12.
we replace all the variables t
with this expression
That's equal.
We can rewrite the blue equation as the length of the bottom.
the shelf is 2 times longer than the top shelf length
And we know that t is equal to m minus 12.
And if we simplify it a little bit, we get
The bottom shelf is equal to, let's multiply that by two.
2 times m is 2m
2 times minus half is minus 1
And that's all minus 12.
Or we could write it as b is equal to 2 times the length.
Middle shelf minus 32.
That's right.
1 is 22 and minus 12 is
Minus 32.
So now we've expressed everything through us and we can
Replace All
So top shelf instead of being here, so
We put m minus 12 here.
So let's put m minus 12 plus the length of the middle here.
shelf plus bottom shelf length
So, we've already expressed that through me.
That's what we just did.
Here is written the length of the bottom shelf depending on m
So instead of writing here, we're going to write 2m minus 32.
plus 2m minus 32 and that equals 12
All we did was replace it.
We expressed it using m and we expressed it using m.
Now we add up all the members with m and constants.
Here we have one and here we have another.
Then we still have 2m here.
and they're all positive
So 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4m.
So we have 4m.
and constant members
Here we have minus 12 and then we have minus 32.
So minus 12 minus 32 is minus 42, which is
Minus 2
So we have 4m minus 2.
And of course, it's still equal to 12.
On one side of the equation, we only want to have
unknown m
So we add to both sides plus 2, and we get rid of the 2 to
on the left
So if you add 2 on both sides of this equation,
so on the left hand side there will only be 4m and these members
cancel out and that's equal to 14.
Now we divide both sides by 4 and we get that m is equal to
14 over 4, that's 72 meters, because we're counting.
in meters
We know him now, but we still miss him.
What's t and b?
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
t is equal to m minus 12.
So it's equal to our m is 72 minus 12, and that's
equal to 62, or 3 meters
We count in meters, so we know that
It's in meters.
So the top shelf is 3 meters long.
The middle shelf is 7.2 meters, which is the same as 3.
And 12 meters.
And the bottom shelf is 2 times the top shelf.
Minus 12.
And that's how much?
That's 2 times 3 meters, that's the length.
Top shelf minus 12, which is 6.
Minus 12, or 5 and 12 meters.
And we're done.
And you can verify that the total is actually 12.
5 and 12 plus 3 and 12 is 9 plus 3 is 12 metres and that
means that equality is fulfilled
The top shelf is 12 metres shorter than the middle shelf.
bottom shelf is 12 metres shorter than
Double top shelf
And we're done.
We already know the shelf lengths that
Devon needs making.
Fill the table with integers.
to write down the number 430 in five different ways
Think about it a little bit.
This 4 here we can see as 4 hundreds.
So four hundred.
And here's 3 in the tens place, so 3 tens.
That's four hundred and three tens.
But there's another way to write it.
For example, we can only have 3 hundreds.
We took 100 from the site of hundreds and now
we can put it in place for dozens
if you take the 100 and put it in place for the tens
100 is 10 tens.
Now you have 10 tens, but before that you had 3 tens.
So you're going to have 13 tens here.
Maybe it seems a little confusing.
Remember, it's 430.
This is 300 plus 130.
That's still 430.
Similarly, you can also see it as 200 plus 230.
230 is the same as 23 tens.
The same way you can look at it as 100 plus 330.
33 tens is 330.
It can also be seen as 0 hundreds and 43 tens.
43 tens is 430.
Welcome, let's talk about the Internet.
which is what you're using right now
The internet is a large network of interconnected computers.
and by 2014, more than
billion websites
a whole billion
Not so long ago, it was only a million.
And that was plenty even then.
what we use the site for
They used them at first.
scientists to share their research
Particle accelerator, for example.
But today, everyone uses them, for just about anything.
it is possible to write with your family via social networking sites
Share with others photos
your cute kittens
Tours abroad can be planned on travel portals.
And the news ones.
To find out what's going on again.
and then of course you need to use the site
Khan academy for study
So what's your favorite site?
I actually have a slightly better question for you.
what the page you're missing on the internet should look like
Maybe a page about you.
Or something you like.
The cool thing is, you can program a site like that yourself.
And you can learn it here at the khan academy.
Think about what you want to create first.
Because you'll soon learn how to do it.
But let's get the terminology straight, for starters.
What exactly is the internet?
Like I said, it's a lot.
linked computers to websites
when the computer is connected to the internet and provides a website
We call it the server.
by English server to serve
The website is written in three languages.
html forming the page structure
css then modifies its appearance and javascript page makes it interactive
how users see these pages
We use an internet browsing app to do that.
For example, chrome firefox or internet explorer.
We call these applications browsers.
browsers all try to view the page the same
but they have some differences
That's why we sometimes say
Oops, there's been an error, try using a different browser.
What browser are you using right now?
You have to use that browser on a device.
like on a laptop, a mobile, a tablet, or a smart TV.
We call all of these devices clients.
Clients can be very different.
Some are smaller than others.
Some have touch screens, others keyboards.
Some are black and white.
websites trying to look good
on all different devices
and what device do you use
And that's the internet.
His two-minute version, that is.
There's plenty more we can learn about him.
But I think it's time to start writing some html and css.
and create your own website
Shade 109.
Just to recap, if we wanted to break 109 down.
It would literally be 109 percent, which is the same thing.
Like 109 for and now I could write a penny again.
But we already know that.
A cent means 100, literally that.
stands for 109 out of 100.
If we had 100 out of 100, we would have one whole.
But now we have more than a whole.
We have 109 out of 100.
We can write this as a ratio or a fraction.
It's the same thing as 109 divided by 100.
equal to 109 over 100
So let's put it out there.
Here we have a whole we will
Consider this square as a whole
We did the math in the last video.
It's a 10-by-10 square.
is divided into 100 parts
We want to get 109 of these 100 parts.
What will it look like?
It means we're shadowing everyone.
100 parts here.
I'll do it in a new color.
So let's color this whole thing.
If we colored just that, we'd have 100.
It would be 100 divided by 100 or 100 out of 100 or 100.
I think you're getting the hang of it.
I don't want you to just memorize it.
It literally means 100 out of 100, or a whole.
So it's a whole square.
It's 100 out of 100 here.
The question is, color 109.
We've already done 100 out of 100, but we still have to do another 9.
So let's color in another 9.
So now we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
6 7 8 9
This piece right here.
That's exactly it.
It's 9 whole squares.
This is 100 whole squares.
if we take this whole piece and add this blue part to it,
We get 109, one.
whole square
I hope that makes sense.
Let's do a few examples.
Let's see.
First example
What's 15 out of 40?
We solve examples with percentages by converting
the percentages to the decimal, which we then multiply
the number from which we want to calculate the percentages
So 15, in decimal terms, is zero-point-15 hundredths.
I hope we learned that in the video about converting percentages to decimals.
In the video, perhaps.
and we're just going to multiply by 40.
So 40 times zero point 15 hundredths.
5 times 0 is 0
5 times 4 is 20.
Scroll Down
Let's write zero.
And then 0 times 0 is 0.
1 times 4 is 4.
And we get six-zero-zero.
Let's write a decimal.
One, two.
There's no decimal at the top, so one, two and a comma.
He belongs here.
So 15 out of 40 is equal to zero point 15 hundredths times 40, which is equal to 6 point zero hundredths.
That's the same thing as 6.
Another example
I hope that didn't confuse you too much.
Now let me try to confuse you a little.
Unless you're already confused by the previous example.
What's zero point two percent from now come up with a number of seven?
Many people are inclined to say
Oh, zero point two percent is the same thing as zero point two tenths.
If you see it the same way, then it's a mistake.
Because let's realize it's not zero point two tenths.
It's zero point two percent.
There are two ways to think about it.
We can say that's zero point two over 100, which is
If you multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10.
Same thing as two over a thousand.
Or we use the technique when we shift.
decimal point two places to the left
which if we start with zero point two tenths and move
The decimal point two places to the left, we get hopped.
Oh.
Hop, hop.
Decimal Comes Here
So it's zero point two thousandths.
That's the key.
zero point two percent is the same as zero point two thousandths.
It may tempt you to make this mistake, I make it out of inattention.
But don't be sad if you ever do.
Always stay sharp when you see them together.
decimal and percentages
Now that we've figured out how to write percentages,
As a decimal number, we have to multiply the number by it.
of which percentage do we count
So zero point two thousandths times 7.
That's pretty simple.
7 times 2 is 14.
How many numbers do we have?
past the decimal point
Let's count.
One, two, three.
So we have to have three numbers behind the decimal point.
So zero point two percent of 7 is equal to zero point 14 thousandths.
I guess you're thinking this is it.
really small number
And that's right, because zero point two percent, if you think about it.
is even less than 1
less than one hundredth
And actually, when we think about it, zero point two percent is one-fifth.
And if we do the math, then one fifth of 7.
Will this be the number?
It's important to check.
It's always good to take a test because
when you're working with decimals and percentages
It's very easy to get lost in decimals.
Or make a multiple of ten.
So always take the test.
Now I'm going to confuse you even more.
What if I say what number is four-twenty percent?
What number?
Many may blurt out
I'll take 20.
Which will be zero point twenty hundredths.
And I'll multiply that by four times.
And that would be a mistake.
Because let's think.
I said what's 20 out of 4, right?
I said 20 out of some number is 4.
We're going to do a little bit of algebra now.
I bet you didn't see that in the examples per cent.
Let's say x is a wanted number.
And the terms say that 20 of x is equal to 4.
I think you recognize it in that form already.
How do we write 20 decimal digits?
zero point twenty hundredths or zero point two tenths
And we multiply that by x to get 4.
20 is the same thing as zero point two tenths
It's the same as zero point twenty hundredths, but that last zero.
We don't.
zero point two tenths times x is equal to four
And there's a simple linear equation.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
What about it?
Two views are possible.
We can just divide both sides of this equation.
coefficient u x
So if we divide zero point by two tenths here and zero point by two tenths here,
x is going to be equal to 4 divided by zero over two tenths.
So let's figure out what 4 is divided by zero point two tenths.
Hopefully we'll have enough room.
zero point two tenths goes into four, let's write a decimal here.
Let's move the decimal here.
One place on the right
We get 2, and even here we have to move the decimal point.
One place on the right
0.2 goes into 4 as many times.
as 2 to 40
And that's easy.
How many times does 2 go into 40?
2 is in four 2 times
And zero goes into 2 zero times.
2 is at 40 20 times
2 is at 40 20 times
So 4 divided by zero point two tenths is 20.
So the answer is 4 is 20 out of 20.
And it makes sense.
There are more ways to think about it.
20 is exactly one fifth.
And 4 times 5 is 20.
That's right.
We can do a test just to be sure.
Let's see what 20 out of 20 is.
So 20 out of 20 is like zero point two tenths times 20.
And if we do the math, it comes out as 4.
So we convinced ourselves that the result was correct.
Let's try another example like this.
I pick numbers at random.
Maybe 3 is 9 out of how many.
Again x is equal to the number of which 3 is 9.
You don't have to rewrite it like that.
So we know that zero point nine hundredths x zero point nine hundredths x is the same thing.
As 9 of x is equal to 3.
or x is equal to 3 divided by zero point nine hundredths
dividing by decimal
So let's write a decimal point.
and a few zeroes needed
If we move the decimal here two places to the right.
We've got to move it up two spots here, too.
009 goes into 3 as many times
as 9 to 300
9 goes into 30 three times
3 times 9 is 27.
I think I see a pattern here already.
Thirty-three 3 times 9 is 27.
30 will be repeated.
will still be coming out 3
based on 3 is 9 of you can also write
333 periodic, we also know that 0.3
is actually one third
So 3 is 9 out of 33 whole and one-third.
That, too, is an acceptable answer.
often when we work with percentages
We are only looking for an approximate result.
Precision isn't that important here.
But in this case, we will be precise.
as well as in tests and there
where it's needed
Hopefully it wasn't too fast and you've got a percentage of the calculation.
Feels good.
in examples with percentages is required
Pay attention to how they're written.
If listed, find 10 out of 100.
It's simple.
We just convert 10 to a decimal and multiply it by 100.
But if the entry is 100, it's 10 out of how many.
It has to be realised that this is a different example.
What number is a hundred and ten, and if we do the math?
It'll be a thousand.
I may have been talking fast enough in counting percentages.
But I hope it didn't confuse you.
I'll upload you more examples.
You may have heard the term libor when people talk about interest rates.
Or, they say, I'll lend you money a few percentage points above the libor rate.
You will hear the libor rate quoted on some financial news channels.
And it's just the average of the interest rates that banks borrow between themselves.
and is calculated by the British Banking Association
In fact, a thomson reuters for the British Banking Association is calculated.
exists for some comparison of other types of securities and financial transactions
And it literally means London interbank offer rate, London interbank offered rate.
It's in London, it's the rate offered between banks.
London interbank offer rate
To understand this a little better, we have set up two banks here.
Bank and bank and you may already know
that when you go and put your money in the bank
The bank won't keep all that money.
The way he makes money is he lends a good part of the money to other people as loans.
and they're just keeping enough money close at hand
These things, you know, people could actually come in and claim their money from their current account.
We have plenty at hand.
You can imagine that every now and then the bank gets into a situation where it's short of cash.
Or it can get close to mandatory minimum reserves.
that a country's central bank requires a bank to have
In these situations, let's say the bank is putting itself in that situation.
They said, let's go and borrow some money.
We'll go and borrow money from another bank.
This is interbank lending.
The bank is overwhelmed with cash here.
They say we don't want to hold that much cash.
We want to borrow it, we can actually get interest on the cash, we don't get interest.
like bank b will lend money to the bank and
Maybe he'll lend that much cash.
This is the new cash the bank got.
This is where the new cash is.
And of course it's credit.
This is a new loan to make up for it, remember.
that assets equal liabilities plus equity
Commitments are all here.
This is a loan from the bank for this cash.
They have a slightly better reserve.
And now the bank's credit would go up and their cash would go down.
This is a loan, a loan to a bank.
This is where they took this cash and gave it to the bank and
And the rate at which they lent it.
1 annual rate was needed
And of course it renews every day, it's a one-day rate.
This rate is the interbank rate.
What do they do on behalf of the British Banking Association?
They're doing a survey of a number of banks in London.
8, 12, 16 banks in London
They said, hey, at what rate do you all trade?
and determine it
determine this as a one-day libor rate
They determined to say 12 across all the banks from the survey.
But what's interesting about the libor rate is that it's quoted in ten currencies.
It's not just in sterling dollars.
Or it's just in ten currencies.
That's what sets her apart from other things.
But it really sets it apart from the actual federal funds rate, which is another interbank lending rate.
But that's in the US.
and more subject to political pressures
The Federal Bank is actually trying to change that.
Hello.

Hello, my name is <NAME> and this is <NAME>.
Our company is called Be Beauty s.r.o.
The company was founded on the fifteenth of May, two thousand and seventeen, and was taken over by the Miss Present on the first of September, two thousand and eighteen.
We take clothes and suits made by Czech designers or tailor shops.
We are careful about the quality of materials. Our clothes and suits are made of recycled and natural materials.
We also want to comment on the environmental problems in the fashion industry.
The fashion industry is the biggest polluter.
That means we produce over a hundred and fifty trillion items of clothing, and another trillion items of clothing are burned or end up in landfills.
In the year two thousand and thirty there will be an increase in demand in the fashion industry as the population increases.
A typical cycle of clothing production is: to get material for fabric, fabric production, fabric weaving, preparation, which to invent means colour and pattern, and finally sewing and finishing the garment.
Thank you for your attention, have a nice day.

Yes, but Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia will cost us a lot of money!
They predict a 5% loss in the first year.
Come on, think positively! about this five percent will be our increase in the third year!
And we definitely got new customers today.
Yeah, you're right.
In fact, we got them all, everyone needs a good night's sleep.

We've been in control of the market since nineteen-ninety-nine, destroying the dreams of other firms.

Think about it.
So, where does our leadership reside?
It's obviously in the mountains.
No, I'm kidding, we have other real cities than just Vienna.

We've been selling the most popular merchandise, which by the way is really iconic, since nineteen ninety-nine, so two decades.
