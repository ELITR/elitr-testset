Any more questions from your side?
If not, then I would kindly invite our romanian colleague to proceed.
Ok.
Hello.
Can you hear me?
So in the Romania, we still have a nineteen percent of VAT tax that we had for last two years, and even though it was balanced to nine and five percent it was postponed for now.
Besides that we had to reduce VAT rates, nine percent and five percent.
And in past year, there were some changes regarding the products that can had- that illustrate.
So we had the biggest change in sewage that was changed to nineteen perc- nineteen to nine percent starting on the first of January twelve-twenty nineteen.
It remained the same for the five percent.
And the wealth of changes minus some of the products that were nine percent haven’t been dropped to- they have been dropped to five percent.
The biggest one was the first of June this year, regarding high quality foods and a mountain product and traditional products.
And the products have to be manufactured on the- in the mountains or either and the sheep has to live- any manufacturer has to get a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
So that- that I would like to illustrate.
Next.
We had reverse tax mechanism. 
In Romania, companies have to be both registered, to be applicable.
They are fourteen products for which it can be used.
Then in December two thousand and eighteen, for some of them the deadline was prolonged until twenty twenty-two.
Finally.
Then we have split VAT system, which was introduced in two thousand and seventeen although now it can look abandoned by the Ministry of Finance.
Cause it started with four hundred plus companies in two thousand and seventeen and now in twenty nineteen the number dropped by forty-six percent.
No new companies have started introduce the system until twenty nineteen.
So those who started initially are dropping now to the normal VAT system.
Plus the European Commission made Romania stop using the system.
So it seems as if it hasn‘t reached its purpose.
The Ministry stopped using altogether. 
This on the data that- that we have.
No new companies have been registered in two thousand and eighteen, either in twenty nineteen, so the companies that started in twenty seventeen are in the system and they‘re slowly decreasing in numbers.
Regarding audit findings.
There are still some regut- regulatory gaps.
Regarding the MOSS system.
Romania is so- M one SS for the system.
That‘s how it is.
There are lacks in IT systems with- within the tax department cooperating between themselves and exchanging data.
Which makes it easier for companies.
Last year, they finally introduced electronic- machin- electronic gadgets- cash register- and the companies are now obligated to use them.
So the task is to go and control if they are installed.
But now I 'm not sure if the system is fully operating, because the limit, the development in the tax system.
No firm trends have been identified as of now.
So that’s it.
Thank you.
