If you do not mind.
I would like to ask you, the Polish colleagues to give the presentation.
Thank you.
And ehm, just let me refresh my, ehm em so I would like tell a few two words about the new regulations, new tools implemented last year and during this year.
Ehm some of them e were presented during our plennary session at Warsaw last year.
So those of you, who are em in Warsaw you you know it briefly.
So I'd just would like only just to briefly recall some of them, and then I will tell you about our previous audit on this area and our findings.
So the first eeem legislation to I  would like to mention is the single audit file.
The introduction of this tools started three years ago.
But last year was the year of the final stage, because the first stage was that em eee the single audit file was em that was obligatory to present it to the tax administration on demand.
And now this is the automatic system.
And ehm the information must be submitted by electronic means without any request.
And since the 1st July on the of last year.
Ahm this is this is obligatory for all type of ehm business entities.
And since eh ehm eeem 2016.
There was obligatory for bigger  companies, then for medium one, smaller one and now for all enterprises.
Eee I will come back to this too, because we find it as a most significant in the in in the area of combating VAT shorts.
The second legislation I would like to mention is so called "fuel package", eem and again, em the leg legislation was introduced step by step.
Depends on the type of the entity and the idea is that licence for fuel trading is granted only to entities, who which are established in Poland, all Polish branches of foreign entities registered for VAT, V A T, in their countries, the same type of entities are allowed to benefit from their excise duty suspension procedures respecting the intra community acquisition of fuel, and em the VAT resulted from em intra community acquisition of fuel will have to be paid immediately after the goods are shipped to Poland or excise duty suspension procedure is finished.
Ehm ee the next legislation, is ehm that transport package ehm.
Eem I may say that eem the draft of law was based the on our Hungarian colleagues experiences.
Because as a as we know the the the first law this ty type of law, was introduced in Hungary, and em but in Poland we introduced this system of the monitoring of the carriage of goods for only particular types some some categories of goods.
Ehm generally speaking, the the goods, which are a subject of excises.
I mean the fuel, tobacco and some others and the monitoring means the monitoring of the eeem ehm em of the transportation of this goods by public roads or by rail.
Aa that means that every single ehm transport must be notified before the transport begin, aaa in the special system, dedicated system and since last year, moreover the em every transport em is connected with the geolocation system.
So every particular truck is possible to be to be verified, where is it.
About the the routes, the parking places et cetera.
And the Minister of Finance ehm for the Ministry of Finance that analyses of the whole system of the big data is provided by online, one of the public institute, and so as we know for now, they the they have up they could ehm they could ehmm take many results and many ehm they could find any irregularities, and they could find the business entity which are which em provides such a transport in a in a kind which are abtnormal in the meaning of routes, of the time et cetera.
And this year we are planning to audit the Ministry of Finance.
How the Ministry of Finance is prepared to ehm ehm to verify and to use the this analyses, because the the system is implemented in the meaning that em this sounds that all these entities have to em to register all transportation and the system is ready in the meaning of the ame analysation whi which are on go ongoing in online.
But we are not know for the moment if the Minister of Finance em uses this information to any action taken by the tax administratio, the tax administration.
Em next legislation is ehm em something similar to our em tech colleague presented yesterday.
Em so we have got a kind of blacklist but in Poland a blacklist means the list of the entities that have been removed of the from the VAT register.
Ahm and we have a system of ehmm based on the information, ehm given again online by banks and the the other eem em entities of the financial system.
And this system allows to em to the service of Minister of Finance to ehm to identify, any irregulari irreg ir irregularities, and ehm em the system is aimed at capturing abnormal transactions and provide information about them to the tax tax authorities eeem eehm online.
And based on this information, the tax administration a may a block the account, the bank account and the particular transaction.
What is a risk of extortion of the amount higher than ehhm emm 10000 euro.
Next legislation is split payment, introduced last year.
For the moment this is the emmm eee the option.
But in fact, this is the option for the em purchaser.
If the one part of the contract use this, then the the the way of the paying is mandatory for supplier, obviously.
And what is important, that i if this split payment mechanism is used, then the joint and several liability of taxpayer is excluded.
Aaa and I will show some num I will tell you about some numbers about using this split may payment machanism in a second.
And the, yeah last but one aam legislation and organizational ehm tools while our colleague from the Ministry of Finance presented it last year quite deeply.
So we've got new National Revenue Administration, a based on ehm em previous free administration and now we have got one em administration combating the em the tax, and the custom administration in one system.
And online registration system.
Ha ha ha.
Ehm for the moment, we've got the em, the obligatory type of cash registers system and the obligatory elements of these cash registers, ahm ehm ee is the electronic memory.
So the tax administration is able to verify on the base of the memory of the authorises authorised type of the cash registers, but we are starting with the system of online registration system for some ehm sectors only.
Em first of all the eem legal services, medical services, em fuels em only some particular sectors.
And that means a preparing to build a central system kept by the Head of the National Revenue Administration.
A in this system, all these transactions should be registered immediately online simply.
And so we are applying discussing to to implement possibly is the split payments ahm ahm for all sensiv, sensitive taxpayers.
Aa that means in fact that we would like the tax administration would like to the em to replace the reverse charge, ehm by this split payments mechanism and the reverse charge and the joint and several liability.
So in all those sectors which within which eeem in which the s eem reverse charge or join all or several liability ehm ee are binding, all these sectors could be covered by this split payment mechanism.
And em as I mentioned I will say a few words about our audit.
Ehm we conducted the audit last year.
The term was ehm the period covered by the audit was quite long, because it was a em a twelve years, we were asked by the k f committee of finance of public finance of the the same of the Polish Chamber of the Parliament to conduct such a audit and a ehmm.
Our findings were as follow.
We had to to state that the the efficiency of the activity of Ministry of Finance during this long period was di differ  different during the em sub periods of this of this of thi of these years.
During the years 2010 2015 em some insufficient in our opinion efforts ehm were taken by the Ministry and the tax administration to improve their efficiency of the VAT revenues.
Mmm one of the indication, because the the  subject of the audit was the supervision of the Ministry of Finance over the em over the tax incomes over the tax em collections, the VAT collection.
And one of the the indication of efficas eficaftne eficass efficasy efficiency sorry of this supervision.
Eeem is there ehm VAT gap.
And during this years  the VAT gap in Poland was on average 24 pierc percent, which was about ten point higher than the medium level of the EU countries.
So that was one of the indication for us that the supervision was not ehm eem ehm effectively contacted.
Mmmm yeah here we've got.
It is possible to say we've got the information about, ehm the VAT gap in Poland and EU countries and eem we ve've got the numbers ehm by the the aam European Commission and Polish Ministry of Finance.
Ehm and as you can see the average European VAT gap is definitely lower than in Poland despite the source of the information the numbers are quite clear here.
Mmmm.
And as I said the main tool in our  and the tax administration as well opinion ahm implemented during this period, was the single audit file, and ehm during the last two years, the tax administration gained the ehm competences to use the databases to analyse them.
And ahm for example, in 2017, four millions of invoices were analyses automatically but only 30000 of warnings were as a result of these analysation process.
Last year, the number of invoices analyses what not too higher, because about five millions, but there are more than 350000 of warnings.
At that gave an efact in in incomes comes because the the first  say am stage is the automatic analysing and then the warning means the warning sent by text messages or e-mails.
So without any official procedure in a tax procedure et cetera.
A and that system ehm, this first stage,  automatic stage, gaves us the results in the incomes, incomes of VAT more than 150 millions euro yearly.
During these last two years, 2017 and 2018.
Eemm the increase in income took place in the conditions of good economic situation and improve VAT collection, resulting from the wide package of legislative and organizational changes introduces during the last years.
But still we think that one of the main source of these results that financial results is the the implementation of this single audit file.
Aaa the results of the the other tool this split may payment mechanise was as follow in 2018  the use of split payment mechanism as I said was voluntary.
But we observe the increased interest in payment in this form.
In July of the last year, taxpayers made em ssss 600 no, sorry, eee yeah, 600000 transa transactions.
In December more than one and half million of transactions using the split payment mechanism.
The value of tax paid using this split payment mechanism in July, that was half of a billion Euro.
In December 1 and half billion euro.
Overall in the period from July to December of the last year, taxpayers carried out more than seven million transactions using the split payment mechanism, and the amount of tax on special accounts for VAT amounted to to approximately six billions euros.
And so eem eem one more information about eem, aaa the tax administration activity aaaa last year the thaam the national tax, the national revenue as ministration carried out 30 percent less controls than in 2017, however, with fewer inspections, the percentage of inspection, in which irregularities were found, increased.
Aaa we think that this is a result of this introduced new electronic tools aa which helped to identify the entity to be properly choose to be a subject of control.
Eeeem the decrease in number of controls was accomplishe aam as  I said by aa increase number in the naaaaaaa oh sorry the the decrease in  the number of controls was accompanion accompaigned by th an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is obviously less painful and aaaaa time consuming for taxpayers.
Aaa and it resulted in increase of finding by 100 percent in last year comparing with the 2017.
So generally, in our opinion of the last few years in Poland was the term of implementation of the several ehmmm eee legislation.
And in total, the results are ehm sufficient.
However, we still have to remember that the economic ehmeeee surrounding ehm were quite well.
So it is hard to divide the source of this incomes between this.
The results of the new organisation and legislation tools.
And just the results of the general economy.
That is all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions, we will try to answer...
