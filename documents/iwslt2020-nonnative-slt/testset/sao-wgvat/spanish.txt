okay so we have made this audit
the audit report is about to be published the 16th of july
so please keep this information confidential
under embargo until the date of publication
we are just waiting for the replies of the commission in all the 23 official language of the eu
because we have the reply only in english so this is only a formality and the audit is its over now
the title was many of the challenges ooof that special report will be many of the challenges of collecting vat in custom duties remain to be resolved
remain to be resolved
originally it was remain to be addressed but to some extent they have been addressed with new pieces of legislation new proposal made by the commission that just the censored referred to
but they remain still the problems that theres an issues that remain to be resolved and we will see later
then i will start with why we have chosen this topic for the for the audit
what do we look at
they are finding something
well finish with our recommendations
first of all ok we carried out the survey because we follow the previous research analysis
based on the findings of the superintendent of these institutions in the field of ecommerce there were some audits by the german colleagues by the lithuanian colleagues
also in a previously determined that we made on imports we analyze the problem of the distance from noneu countries and the related problems concerning vat and custom duties and we decided that it was worth it to go deeper during this audit
the problem here is that the honest traders are frequently expelled from the market by dishonest traders and they cannot compete anymore
this is a problem that have been raised also by a representative of the academia like professor rita de la feria and its especially intensive in the united kingdom
also the estimates about losses
there are only estimates concerning the distances from noneu countries
but these estimates are not very encouraging because ok while the commission have made an estimate of only five billion per year in the uk is between one and one point five billion pounds per year
they have estimated these losses
this represents between eight and ten percent of the vat cut in the united kingdom
but be careful because antifraud represent currently only four percent
so we have three times the volume of the antifraud in the uk is represented the losses of ecommerce of goods purchased from noneu countries
so this is a mission
we are not counting here the intraeu distance sales we are not counting here the most electronic services
so the matter is raise our concerns
then what we look at of course is a we visit five member states  germany ireland the netherlands austria and sweden
why we took into account the number of registration for the mos both in the noneu and the us schemes
also the volume of intraeu intraeu ecommerce sales and finally the estimated amount of the vat foregone as a consequence of the low value consignment relief
following on a study of our source by the commission we also visited the commission
these acts should debug the technology and the world customs organizations and the deleted period ran from 2015 until the end of 2018
but we took into account also the new pieces of legislation on the proposal made and all the proposal that will enter into force in 2021
what do we look at
of course we we started analyzing the replies to our survey the survey that was sent by core group two
we continue with questionnaire in all the member states that we visited with interviews with all possible people
we got access and this is very important too set up a abc data access to the synergia database the database of incidents and problems that tickets reported by member states on the mos
we got the access to all the fiscali project groups and electronic groups concerning ecommerce and all the but related project groups that there is a lot of information and discussion concerning the functioning of the mos
and of course we got the finance from the support of the institutions of germany of the netherlands and belgium and finally we carried out our own samples on different transactions
on the whole we summoned nearly nine hundred transactions related to ecommerce
what do we fi what we find here of course they were first the positive things and then we will continue with the most negative things
the regulatory framework follow the international best practice that having extremes by the oecd and the world customs organization
in most respects concerning the oecd they principle of taxation at a destination has been respected in most cases except for that
now there is a new threshold below tenth thousand euro you can report in the member state of origin so this is not complying with the oecd
for the world customs organization that deals with the packages imported the immediate release guidelines have been followed in most respects and also the new proposal the framework of the standards
the commission is pioneer in this and they align in most respects with the world customs organization and standards
concerning the new provision that will enter in 2021
i aim to resolve some of the weaknesses but for us the main problem that it will continue to happen is undervaluation
their the losses on vat and custom duties are experience and will continue to do
and this cannot be tackle with the proposal of a chain of information with payment service providers
as far as the trade with noneu countries is concerned this wont be solved and we will see later why
why yes because administrative cooperation arrangement with noneu countries they dont work
we have the new agreement with norway this is fine
we are the were expecting a change of information with norway that this will work but this is not the problem
its not norway the problem is china its the united states
then the chain of information with china is not working because the chinese counterpart they do not reply and the percentage of reply is dropping and dropping and dropping so thats the the problem
if we have information about a change of supplier who is not operating using electronic interface so is operating directly in his website who is not registering for the mos or even register and then we revoke the registration he will open a new website
so how come we are paying the vat from europe to china and we expect that vat will be will come back to eu
if we dont have the administrative cooperation too
this will never happen
thats the problem even between eu countries is not working as expected
the administrative cooperation too so we will see later on then the controls carried out by national tax authorities are weak
because there is practically no tools to carried out a proper risk analysis of a chance has mentioned before
and for this we will be necessary that the member state approve the proposal of the commission to change information with the payment service providers being in the control of the commission are insufficient
and we will see later of course the commission had not carried out any monitoring on that no monitoring
then there are weaknesses in the custom electronic clearance systems
of course the traditional problem is that the traders undervalued the goods so to be below the twenty two or ten year euro threshold for the vat
and this will disappear in the future but they will continue to undervalue in order to pay less vat
it wont be assented but they will pay less and concerning custom duties the assumption is set at one hundred fifty euros and they cannot manage
because in all the electronic we will see later electronic clearance system of the eu they are not able to stop the declaration
because they tick on the custom electronic in the box that they apply for the customer electronically for the custom relief
and they asserted the system even if they declared a value which is above one hundred and fifty
the electronic system are not able to stop it they have said that and this is something very serious because the operators that are working there are hopeful economic operators
so the big couriers they have an authority economic operators association and they purport to be the most reliable but they are abusing the system
an enforcements of collection of vat custom duties is not effective
ok the provisions for the a chain of information on the recovery of claims related to that tax
they have rarely been used of the five member states that we have visited only in austria
only in five occasions so its not frequently uses
there are mismatches of payments between member states we analyze
we have access to the reconciliation carried out by the commission and there are still missed matches
important means much between member states
there is of course the problem in the netherlands that they are not able to reconcile that has explained the vat amounts received with the vat returns
and there are problems also with the reminders that also our colleagues from the nku yesterday they
they supposed problem with the reminders by the member states of consumption that are not made
so here is the summary of our findings related to the mos samples
we concluded that the mos it infrastructure is fit for its purposes so is strong
it can handle the user so the it infrastructure is is sound but there are problems with the registrations and payments between member states
concerning for example we analyze the incidence reported in the synergia in the synergia database between member states but there are only a few twentytwo cases in the five member states
that we visited in which the member state with the the already origin of the problem and as affecting member state
there were only twelve cases so there there were not so many cases the problem is that the attitude for member states was really passive
only when the issues escalated they started working on that but they it take long periods to solve issues
regarding mos it takes long periods but there are not many issues
also for the technical error messages sent and received between member states also the reaction is very passive is not is not proactive only when the issue escalate as an incident they start reacting
but this the infrastructure for the mos is robust
we have not assessed whether they are prepared for the one stop shop
this is something else we received some complaints especially from austria
they say that they wont be ready also from the netherlands path we have not analyzed because the the system is developing in particular for custom using the import one stop shop
there are problem with registrations is with here
we have to differentiate within the nonus scheme and the eu scheme a merely eighty percent of the application for registrations were not properly controlled were not properly controlled
regarding the knowing nonus scheme and we even be found we have found cases of double registrations which is something serious then concerning the payments is especially the problem of the lack of remainder issues by the member state of consumption
and sometimes by the member state of identifications
and problems with the registrations and cancellation of the registration
this is for the most regarding the administrative cooperation this are the exchange of information between the member states that we visited
and we compare here with the the total activity of the chains of information we can see that the for example there are total requirements for information that have been sent for a hundred eighty two compared with the total requirements of information
not related to the common in general is nine thousand two hundred so as the ecommerce is even be many are even more problematic in the united kingdom for example three times more problematic
the level of a chain of information is good he is very low also some member states dont they have changed not entertain reason why we recommend to have separates cno centralized home office
separated structure devoted to ecommerce or to at least to mos so the level of chain of information is very weak
then we have the multilateral controls there were six cases of multilateral controls in two cases
it was really successful experience
but in two cases it was not successful at all because the member state of identification refused to participate in the multilateral control
this is something that is supposed to be solved with the new legislation enforced because now two member states can request to carry out a control
and then the other is is a recent request the other member state the member state of identification that it cannot refuse to participate
so hopefully we will see it will be improved but there are other things important for eurofisc
there were four hundred and eighty signals a chain through eurofisc is working full five for ecommerce and only one feedback concerning this four hundred and eighty
so the member state did not find this information very useful they dont know why they have been selected only five member states put the seniors into the database
and the others they did not read it because they did not find the information very useful
so there are also some signal formation concerning fraud trends or topic three or four topics a change they found that useful
and then there is changing web crawling tools but this is something that some members take on legally use in their countries
other member states they are prevented by the internal legislation to use the web crawling tools
so now the working file is frozen and the activities frozen is not useful
they are waiting for the proposal of the on the chain of information between payment service provider
because they will they will be a database and they will have access
thats the proposal of the commission to all the information supplied by the payment service provider by any other countries does the proposal of the commission
we of course support very much and we place the proposal in the report but i didnt know that even the commission needs some support on that proposal because now i realize i asked yesterday censored and censored said that there are problems in the council
but i gave i gave for granted because this proposal come from some discussion in some fora with member states and with stakeholder on
hopefully this is very important because the there is another problem is lack of controls and audit to mos
why are there so few audits
you can compare here they are nobodies why because thats never how can i if not i dont know it i dont have data region analysis
so my audit will be randomly selection with maybe a lot of inform and no records so they need some data and this the data
there will be many more application the company in addition to doing
yeah it appear about germany these understand it because we have the data
nonus team but the information may he have available
a phenomenon
but i dont know further there is no practically no control
also the inspections of knowledge on distance intraeu distances were not very successful
therefore the customs we have the results of the sample by courier from the and the postal abuses
in the post office the main problems to tackle the the question of undervaluation you have drones very expensive drones declared below ten units or to twenty two euros
sample like these are thousand as so simple
and they can read and its very difficult to handle that at the level of a post office
and for the courier they are abusing the the custom relief of one hundred and fifty because they just tick on the box for the assumption and then the fifty is not able to close
the declaration to stop the declaration even though devaluation higher than one hundred and fifty we check that not only in the sample also in the directly in the custom electronic system in the dam environment where we made some trials on
member states it didnt working in any member state only in austria it work it
but in austria it did not receive
we put on another declaration for alcohol
and then for alcohol it was asserted and because this categorization a applicable to alcoholic products
so there are also some failures in the austrian system
so this and the problem is the authorised economic operator the most reliable custom traders are abusing the system
then we have the recommendation the recommendation on the for the commission is that it makes use of the structures provided in the treaties of mutual assistance with noneu countries
to tackle the issues to tackle the issues identify a lack of replies
also to carry out the inspection of member state controls on the locally concerning relief
monitor the functioning of the intraeu distance sales a minimum stop shop this recommendation is the only that the commission has not accepted it
this why yesterday was laughing because youre on task
is the commission monitoring and censored 2225 said yes yes yes
i was laughing but ok
they assist member state to develop a methodology to produce the estimates of the compliance vat gap on newcomers
because this is the problem weve cannot know whether the system is working or not
the most system is assumed to be successful but is usually an assumption and thats we have an estimate on the most vat gap
we dont know whether the system is successful and for the intraeu itself we dont have also any any estimate so it would be very important
that the commission assist member states developing this is a calculation of the vat gap
also very important to explore the use of alternative technology solu solutions
to tackle vat fraud maybe there could be assisting alternative system of split payments
using blockchain technology there are proposed paths the kpmg kpmg and also proposal of professor e ensworth
there very interesting proposals of course we have discussed with the commission the commission say that they are theoretical in practical way they come to solutions
didnt find any practical application in reality also professor lamas has made some proposals of using technology for the imports from the noneu countries
but are this this system accepted by many by other countries
there are no practical experience but i think we think that is worth it too to go deeper blockchain technology of offers opportunities
this is something that is being explored also by the commission to manage the database of the i important stop shops
numbers to manage the validity of this i ioss numbers
its very important he which this is the future this is the only way to tackle fraud with using the new technologies name for member states
we like of course that they are start reacting to the fraud seniors refacing eurofisc
also monitor the tradeoff compliant with the new threshold of ten thousand euros
this is something that was highlighted by the czech colleagues in their report
and we took on board also for the reason that they explained before
to have a separate mos and distances coordination function in the fellows also to ensure that trader can only introduce the vat rate correct vat rate in the mos vat returns
because if the trader introduces a wrong vat rate he receives only an advice but the declaration can be sent anyway so it received an alert but it will be sent anyway
also perform the necessary checks upon receipt of the application for registration in the mos to avoid this problem of double registrations
increase the audit activity in the mos traders and distance sellers using administrative cooperation tools
an employee of the periodic estimates on the compliance vat upon ecommerce
so if for this recommendation to member states we would be very grateful if you could remember in your home countries about importance to follow our recommendations
this is why we seek your cooperation in this matter and thats all we know if you have any questions
