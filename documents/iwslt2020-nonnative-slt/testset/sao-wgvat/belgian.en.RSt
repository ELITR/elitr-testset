So we would like to continue.
And I would like to ask the core of all its us to present of their presentations job.
So here.
I 'm going to present our state of play.
We have two national loss in order to in order to reopen regulation, so directives oneness about paper and digital publications they have this same right to know that, and on certain circumstances is to zero, right.
And under the circumstances.
It is six persons for real estate, until we did that fronting the properties, nature to Mend it, or to the a 84 short term rental property.
So then we have executed tortoise.
Would it is one is that we have meant just several times.
So I 'm going to briefly about this.
And the other one is for resistance to register to cash register systems.
Then we have new throat trends or the audit.
I hold most as of the published its conclusions and accommodations, unjust limb under it, but to a confident that there will not be any big changes.
So I will continue in our conclusions them.
Uh, the regiment, just same as we have heard already.
But for us.
I will just point o, and some things that are different, Us as it is time off for the moment, because we are more or less more receive the, and we rely very much on and the other member states, but in the future, when when most will be extended.
There will be more need for more stuff.
And the stuff should be on the road to train now, and has seen no another general conclusion.
We had such was which we all are to hurt more or less.
Well, so there was change of control policy, which has to take place, and you state of mind as as a ministration as very confident.
Did you know that?
Uh, that the Mercedes, we see that there is a poor control Polis is.
So we will are confident.
Nevertheless, a point it showed that it was important to make progress in this some way, but in control policy by making risk profiles.
No, our administration as in being able to use it so them.
Because when we have.
We do not have enough data, but we think we will have more data in the future.
And could we could make these profiles.
So there is some think will follow up in the future of the control policy.
It is better another point, and which is more less specific.
We do want to of the tax payers on the Internet.
So there is system to find takes this on the Internet.
But no, the sale also rather pulled down on this.
So many tax payers.
Then we see that it is society, registration procedure.
It such is okay.
But in circumstances.
One takes pay us and register.
There is now follow up if they put in a declaration in the regular system.
There is no link or no follow up systems, which we still think it is important.
Then we have with the in the Declaration Procedure.
There are some automatic checks, which we think is a very interesting.
So it is not a real control of completeness, correct.
But it is still.
It is still helps when there is and aerosol might.
So the really controls on have to be done.
Miss 80 them aside.
The Belgium is still helping to have to load the declaration.
So that was mistakes that will be an others in the system when we have to make choices.
The judges are limited, and she you have to click on.
Some of the choice 's.
It will be less mistakes.
We also discovered this.
So was Benjamin in advance, and let some as they have made matrix of service and the risks to the art of the array of developing now activities and functions of those risks.
And I will read it to test files and have started up wellknown.
So recommended this work for the.
We determined to make progress there and expand the knowledge to to European for us.
I think that is about the the differences we had from what we we had the year before.
So I will go to to the second order board.
It is just that cache system.
It was also an audit, which was a bit puerto, but I will prisons rock collisions of recommendations.
But the important for three, the old question wars, although the visions and effectiveness of control policy, insulation and applications.
So we looked at two problems concerning the cash register system, and the and the system had for the fight against Tex for what the conclusions.
And recommendations were concluded that the recommendations regulations are too complex 's.
The recommendation was to simplify it, because there were so many exceptions and the regulations, international regulations that it was very difficult to determine certain groups, just on the basis of decorations alone.
So it was very difficult to monitor or control certain groups of companies that had been stole or just to catch the register care system.
Another big conclusion walls that control policy that problems with selection of the take status register kitchen system when the war.
So this threshold, and the declaration.
When the the question is too low, uh, to have full special.
And there will be no controls this horse away to escape from the legislation.
Also, there was a problem of cross-checking information and data out of databases for the selection of tax payers to control them.
Another conclusion was that there are poor internal controls as well for the application of the system as the finds that were given.
So they discovered that that different control units gave different findings.
So so there were prescriptions for findings someone very strict for all teams.
All teams were not strict at all.
They are finding a way below the rates.
And there were certain faults, also the risk analysis, and on one axis would be an advantage is, but it is not implemented now.
So risk analysis was very basic.
And there is no online access, since we learned that this kind of system and the countries to half online to have online access to discover that it could be very good, very good advantage as he is done.
There was also the exchange of information with the National Social security office, which is which was not very, very good.
So lot of information did not pass from one to another.
He finally about the impact of the system as there still problem with with the interior of transactions.
So the system of such works very well.
When it is when it is used as it has to be used for us, and certain transactions are not enter into the system.
They could not be discovered.
So solution could be to have me the media campaign for the customers to ask for tickets.
So this would make sure that every transaction would be entered in the system is otherwise.
It would not be a ticket, or that the legislation that only electronic bitten payments were abused, because then it would be easier to follow the money that is.
But as real impact is, there is no reliable measurement of the administration of the of the system.
Today.
We have no idea.
Our team has done some tests that has tried to find some impact is, but they discovered.
There was an anticipation effect.
Since the introduction of the of the system was delayed for a few years, but everybody knew it was coming so customers.
And also the companies already anticipated.
The legislation that was going to change and the introduction of the system.
So it is very difficult to see see the exact differences between between about income before 2000, and 16 years when the system was introduced.
And after this already few years before 2000 16 as the there were already was or knowledge about.
This is just the few aspects of this is to change sort.
He was not sure of the effect, only about the system, or whether the effect was even bigger, because it started earlier, the matter interrupt her life to understand it correctly.
What do I understand under this term, registered cash register system.
Does that mean that this cash register system is somewhere in the database registered.
No, it is.
It is not online.
It is a cash machine, think to face a hotels and restaurants that only for certain branch for now, and it is as susman that registers, every transaction or should register every transaction that is put in it.
But there is no online access.
That is why the selection of the control group is very controlled himself to go to the different places, the complicated online on on the computer.
They have to go to the work and connect their computer to cash register system.
And and they get the data in the system and do the controls.
They can do it from a distance.
They have to go to the premises.
And that is why?
When the Declaration is too low, and it is under the threshold.
The teams one go to see well.
If there were to know the cat food.
For instance, there is a lot of customers, and they are not enter that.
Just the coincidence that is something they discovered only later.
So thank you.
John for the question.
But what is the difference than between the system you are talking about and the Cash Register system center, the grocery.
What was the special thing.
In this particular system.
There is a special software, and it provides any possibility prevent prudence and possibility fraught with in the system.
The software also makes sure that the data is transferable to the computer of the control teams while regular cash register systems.
You.
Can 't extract the data in the same way.
So these are cash register systems that have a or in the special to put.
I think I think there are five different arts of cash Times Cash registers, from which you can use and their certification and all data that is extracted will.
And that is good for the control teams to analyze.
So the compatibility certified.
That is the main difference actually mentioned this.
This risk analysis is a lack of risk analysis.
There were not perform at all and online access to this analysis on the online access to the cash register system itself, which could make the controls farm easier, because then we can do all automatic controls the extraction of data, which could be put into a bigger system.
And the risk analysis.
It is very, very basic, actually, because they did not have enough.
Data was also, because this product, the system was only introduced in 2016.
So they only had two years of data to work with.
So to finish, I have two new fraught trends of our administration.
First one was the discovered during an operation, which was called mad money.
It was a registration of many foreign companies or was under names, or by the same two managers, one Russian one Bulgarian, but the Wrychester, under names that were very similar, turn the names by the same similar to no names.
There was just one letter of difference, just to make it possible that these companies existed.
But most of them did not exist at all.
And then data to decoration of.
And the us for being here are found which, but they always did this declaration by paper for small amounts, which means that the administration had to put in all the information themselves to the system, which took time at, and therefore about already done some refunds before they could actually discover, and the how was specifically to approach, and then could control it that the company was through the existing and to the inner voice, this, where real that this kind of kind of fraught was discovered and information spreads to your face.
So think that over a tax administration now is aware of this kind of work that, and at the throat was in dream power certificates.
So were similar to the person with the Ceo, two.
In the past.
There was a scheme more or less in the same sense that the West sank into voices by using voices for of that resemble very much the Oh of the legal from that should send the envoys.
So we had a scheme to make it very short and make a picture of it to explain it.
This side was come to name in member states takes the bias certificates from B in another member state a, and then they would sell it.
The certificates to companies see again.
Another member states is not that sense of this company and voice from so my.
So there is just lot of difference with the original one.
So the companies see would not see.
There is actually a fraud going on.
And of course, this company and company, except they were the same managers who in the companies, and they accept miss and try to.
I hope this kind of schemas clan...
