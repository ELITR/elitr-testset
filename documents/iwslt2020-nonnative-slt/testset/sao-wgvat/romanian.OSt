Any more questions from your side?
If not then I would kindly invite our Romanian colleagues to proceed.
Ok, hello.
Can you hear me?
Yeah?
So in Romania we still have the nineteen percent VAT tax, that we had for the last two years.
And even though there were plans to, for it to drop to eighteen percent, this has been postponed for now.
Beside that we have two reduced VAT rates, the nine percent and the five percent.
And the the past year have been some changes regarding the the products that can have the reduced rate.
So we have the biggest change was with sewage that was changed from nineteen percent to nine percent starting first of January this year.
The others remained the same.
And for the five percent there were bit, a lot of changes, mainly some of the products that were at nine percent have been dropped to five percent.
The biggest one was, the last one was from the first of June this year, regarding high quality foods, and mountain products, equal, and traditional products.
And for that the products have to be manufactured on a mountain or like the cows or the sheep have to live there at least half their lifes.
And the the manufacturer has to get them authorisation, a certificate from the Minister of Agriculture.
So that he can apply the reduced rate.
Next we have like the reversed tax mechanism.
In Romania, both companies have to be registered in order to be applicable.
There are fourteen products for which it can be reduced and in December two thousand eighteen for some of them the the deadline has be prolonged until twenty twenty two.
Finally, we also have the split VAT system, which was introduced in two thousand seventeen, although now it kind of looks a bit abandoned by the Ministry of Finance.
Because it started with four hundred plus companies in two thousand seventeen and now in two thousand nineteen the number dropped to, by, forty six percent.
Like no new companies started using the system in two thousand eighteen.
So all the companies that started initially have since started dropping the system and returning to the normal VAT system.
Plus the the European Commission did the Romania to stop using this system.
So it looks like it hasn't reached its potential so the Ministry is probably gonna stop using it altogether.
Totally?
This is from the data that we have, I mean, like no new companies have been registered in two thousand eighteen and not, and also not in two thousand nineteen.
So only the companies that started in two thousand seventeen are in the system, and they're slowly decreasing in numbers.
Regarding all that findings there are still some regulatory gaps, regarding the MOSS system which in Romania is M one SS for some reason because they translated the one.
But that's how it was.
And also there's, there are, lacks in the IT systems with the, in the, tax department cooperating between themselves and exchanging data.
Which doesn't make it easier for companies, and the the last year they finally introduced the electronic machine, a machine, like the ones in Belgium.
They set the electronic cash registers and the companies are now obligated to start using them so the tax the tax authorities going and controlling them to see if everybody installed them.
But for now it's we are not really sure if the system is fully operational because of limits in the IT system on the part of the tax department.
And no new trends have been have been identified as of now.
So that's it.
Thank you.
