Okay, so, we have made this audit.
The audit report is about to be published the 16th of July.
So, please keep this information confidential.
Under embargo until the date of publication.
We are just waiting for the replies of the commission in all the 23 official language of the EU.
Because we have the reply only in English, so this is only a formality and the audit is it's over now.
The title was “Many of the challenges o-o-of” that special report will be “Many of the challenges of collecting VAT in custom duties remain to be resolved”.
Remain to be resolved.
Originally it was “remain to be addressed”, but to some extent they have been addressed with new pieces of legislation new proposal made by the commission that just the <CENSORED> referred to.
But they remain still the problems that there's an issues that remain to be resolved and we will see later.
Then, I will start with why we have chosen this topic for the for the audit.
What do we look at.
They are finding something.
We'll finish with our recommendations.
First of all, ok, we carried out the survey, because we follow the previous research analysis.
Based on the findings of the superintendent of these institutions in the field of e-commerce there were some audits by the German colleagues, by the Lithuanian colleagues.
Also in a previously determined that we made on imports we analyze the problem of the distance from non-EU countries and the related problems concerning VAT and custom duties and we decided that it was worth it to go deeper during this audit.
The problem here is that the honest traders are frequently expelled from the market by dishonest traders and they cannot compete anymore.
This is a problem that have been raised also by a representative of the academia like professor Rita de la Feria and it's especially intensive in the United Kingdom.
Also the estimates about losses.
There are only estimates concerning the distances from non-EU countries.
But these estimates are not very encouraging because, ok, while the commission have made an estimate of only five billion per year, in the UK is between one and one point five billion pounds per year.
They have estimated these losses.
This represents between eight and ten percent of the VAT cut in the United Kingdom.
But be careful, because anti-fraud represent currently only four percent.
So we have three times the volume of the anti-fraud in the UK is represented the losses of e-commerce of goods purchased from non-EU countries.
So this is a mission.
We are not counting here the intra-EU distance sales, we are not counting here the most electronic services.
So the matter is raise our concerns.
Then what we look at of course is a we visit five member states - Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden.
Why we took into account the number of registration for the MOS both in the non-EU and the US schemes.
Also the volume of intra-EU intra-EU e-commerce sales and finally the estimated amount of the VAT foregone as a consequence of the low value consignment relief.
Following on a study of our source by the commission, we also visited the commission.
These acts should debug the technology and the World Customs Organizations and the deleted period ran from 2015 until the end of 2018.
But we took into account also the new pieces of legislation on the proposal made and all the proposal that will enter into force in 2021.
What do we look at?
Of course, we we started analyzing the replies to our survey the survey that was sent by core group two.
We continue with questionnaire in all the member states that we visited with interviews with all possible people.
We got access, and this is very important too, set up a ABC data access to the Synergia database the database of incidents, and problems that tickets reported by member states on the MOS.
We got the access to all the fiscali project groups and electronic groups concerning e-commerce and all the BUT related project groups, that there is a lot of information and discussion concerning the functioning of the MOS.
And of course we got the finance from the support of the institutions of Germany, of the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally we carried out our own samples on different transactions.
On the whole, we summoned nearly nine hundred transactions related to e-commerce.
What do we fi, what we find here, of course, they were first the positive things and then we will continue with the most negative things.
The regulatory framework follow the international best practice that having extremes by the OECD and the World Customs Organization.
In most respects concerning the OECD, they principle of taxation at a destination has been respected in most cases except for that.
Now, there is a new threshold below tenth thousand euro you can report in the member state of origin so this is not complying with the OECD.
For the World Customs Organization that deals with the packages imported the immediate release guidelines have been followed in most respects and also the new proposal the framework of the standards.
The commission is pioneer in this and they align in most respects with the World Customs Organization and standards.
Concerning the new provision that will enter in 2021...
I aim to resolve some of the weaknesses, but for us the main problem that it will continue to happen is undervaluation.
Their the losses on VAT and custom duties are experience and will continue to do.
And this cannot be tackle with the proposal of a chain of information with payment service providers.
As far as the trade with non-EU countries is concerned, this won't be solved and we will see later why.
Why, yes, because administrative cooperation arrangement with non-EU countries they don't work.
We have the new agreement with Norway. This is fine.
We are the we're expecting a change of information with Norway that this will work, but this is not the problem.
It's not Norway, the problem, is China, it's the United States.
Then, the chain of information with China is not working, because the Chinese counterpart, they do not reply and the percentage of reply is dropping and dropping and dropping so that's the the problem.
If we have information about a change of supplier, who is not operating using electronic interface, so is operating directly in his website, who is not registering for the MOS or even register and then we revoke the registration, he will open a new website...
So, how come we are paying the VAT from Europe to China, and we expect that VAT will be will come back to EU.
If we don't have the administrative cooperation too.
This will never happen.
That's the problem even between EU countries is not working as expected.
The administrative cooperation too, so we will see later on then the controls carried out by national tax authorities are weak.
Because there is practically no tools to carried out a proper risk analysis of a chance has mentioned before.
And for this we will be necessary that the member state approve the proposal of the commission to change information with the payment service providers being in the control of the commission are insufficient.
And we will see later, of course the commission had not carried out any monitoring on that no monitoring.
Then there are weaknesses in the custom electronic clearance systems.
Of course, the traditional problem is that the traders undervalued the goods, so to be below the twenty, two or ten year euro threshold for the VAT.
And this will disappear in the future, but they will continue to undervalue in order to pay less VAT.
It won't be assented, but they will pay less and concerning custom duties, the assumption is set at one hundred fifty euros and they cannot manage.
Because in all the electronic we will see later electronic clearance system of the EU they are not able to stop the declaration.
Because they tick on the custom electronic in the box that they apply for the customer electronically for the custom relief.
And they asserted the system even if they declared a value, which is above one hundred and fifty.
The electronic system are not able to stop it they have said that and this is something very serious because the operators that are working there are hopeful economic operators.
So, the big couriers, they have an authority economic operators association and they purport to be the most reliable, but they are abusing the system.
An enforcements of collection of VAT custom duties is not effective.
Ok, the provisions for the a chain of information on the recovery of claims related to that tax.
They have rarely been used of the five member states that we have visited only in Austria.
Only in five occasions, so it's not frequently uses.
There are mismatches of payments between member states we analyze.
We have access to the reconciliation carried out by the commission and there are still missed matches.
Important means much between member states.
There is of course the problem in the Netherlands, that they are not able to reconcile, that has explained the VAT amounts received with the VAT returns.
And there are problems also with the reminders that also our colleagues from the NKU yesterday, they.
They supposed problem with the reminders by the member states of consumption that are not made.
So here is the summary of our findings related to the MOS samples.
We concluded that the MOS IT infrastructure is fit for its purposes, so is strong.
It can handle the user, so the IT infrastructure is is sound but there are problems with the registrations and payments between member states.
Concerning for example we analyze the incidence reported in the Synergia, in the Synergia database between member states but there are only a few twenty-two cases in the five member states.
That we visited, in which the member state with the the already origin of the problem and as affecting member state.
There were only twelve cases, so there there were not so many cases the problem is that the attitude for member states was really passive.
Only when the issues escalated they started working on that, but they it take long periods to solve issues.
Regarding MOS, it takes long periods, but there are not many issues.
Also for the technical error messages sent and received between member states also the reaction is very passive is not is not proactive only when the issue escalate as an incident they start reacting.
But this the infrastructure for the MOS is robust.
We have not assessed whether they are prepared for the one stop shop.
This is something else, we received some complaints, especially from Austria.
They say that they won't be ready, also from the Netherlands path we have not analyzed, because the the system is developing in particular for custom, using the import one stop shop.
There are problem with registrations is with here.
We have to differentiate within the non-US scheme and the EU scheme, a merely eighty percent of the application for registrations, were not properly controlled were not properly controlled.
Regarding the knowing non-US scheme and we even be found, we have found cases of double registrations, which is something serious, then concerning the payments is especially the problem of the lack of remainder issues by the member state of consumption.
And sometimes by the member state of identifications.
And problems with the registrations and cancellation of the registration.
This is for the most regarding the administrative cooperation this are the exchange of information between the member states that we visited.
And we compare here with the the total activity of the chains of information we can see that the, for example there are total requirements for information that have been sent for a hundred eighty two compared with the total requirements of information.
Not related to the common in general is nine thousand two hundred, so as the e-commerce is even be many are even more problematic in the United Kingdom, for example, three times more problematic.
The level of a chain of information is good he is very low, also some member states don't they have changed not entertain reason why we recommend to have separates CNO centralized home office.
Separated structure devoted to e-commerce or to at least to MOS, so the level of chain of information is very weak.
Then we have the multilateral controls, there were six cases of multilateral controls in two cases.
It was really successful experience.
But in two cases it was not successful at all, because the member state of identification refused to participate in the multilateral control.
This is something that is supposed to be solved with the new legislation enforced, because now two member states can request to carry out a control.
And then the other is is a recent request the other member state the member state of identification that it cannot refuse to participate.
So, hopefully, we will see it will be improved, but there are other things important for EUROFISC.
There were four hundred and eighty signals a chain through EUROFISC is working full five for e-commerce, and only one feedback concerning this four hundred and eighty.
So, the member state did not find this information very useful, they don't know why they have been selected only five member states, put the seniors into the database.
And the others, they did not read it because they did not find the information very useful.
So, there are also some signal formation concerning fraud trends or topic, three or four topics a change they found that useful.
And then there is changing web crawling tools, but this is something that some members take on legally use in their countries.
Other member states, they are prevented by the internal legislation to use the web crawling tools.
So, now the working file is frozen and the activities frozen is not useful.
They are waiting for the proposal of the on the chain of information between payment service provider.
Because they will, they will be a database and they will have access.
That's the proposal of the commission, to all the information supplied by the payment service provider by any other countries does the proposal of the commission.
We, of course, support very much and we place the proposal in the report, but I didn't know that even the commission needs some support on that proposal, because now I realize I asked yesterday <CENSORED> and <CENSORED> said that there are problems in the council.
But I gave, I gave for granted because this proposal come from some discussion in some fora with member states, and with stakeholder on.
Hopefully, this is very important, because the there is another problem is lack of controls and audit to MOS.
Why are there so few audits?
You can compare here, they are nobodies why, because that's never how can i if not i don't know it i don't have data region analysis.
So, my audit will be randomly selection with maybe a lot of inform and no records so they need some data and this the data.
There will be many more application the company in addition to doing.
Yeah, it appear about Germany, these understand it because we have the data.
Non-US team, but the information may he have available.
A phenomenon.
But, I don't know further there is no practically no control.
Also the inspections of knowledge on distance intra-EU distances were not very successful.
Therefore the customs, we have the results of the sample by courier from the and the postal abuses.
In the post office the main problems to tackle the the question of undervaluation you have drones very expensive drones declared below ten units or to twenty two euros.
Sample like these are thousand as so simple.
And they can read and it's very difficult to handle that at the level of a post office.
And for the courier they are abusing the the custom relief of one hundred and fifty, because they just tick on the box for the assumption and then the fifty is not able to close.
The declaration to stop the declaration, even though devaluation higher than one hundred and fifty we check that, not only in the sample, also in the directly in the custom electronic system in the dam environment where we made some trials on.
Member states it didn't working in any member state only in austria it work it.
But in Austria it did not receive.
We put on another declaration for alcohol.
And then for alcohol it was asserted and because this categorization a applicable to alcoholic products.
So, there are also some failures in the Austrian system.
So, this and the problem is the authorised economic operator the most reliable custom traders are abusing the system.
Then, we have the recommendation the recommendation on the for the commission is that it makes use of the structures provided in the treaties of mutual assistance with non-eu countries.
To tackle the issues, to tackle the issues identify a lack of replies.
Also to carry out the inspection of member state controls on, the locally concerning relief.
Monitor the functioning of the intra-EU distance sales a minimum, stop shop this recommendation is the only that the commission has not accepted it.
This why yesterday was laughing because you're on task.
Is the commission monitoring and <CENSORED 22:25> said: "yes yes yes".
I was laughing, but, ok.
They assist member state to develop a methodology to produce the estimates of the compliance VAT gap on newcomers.
Because this is the problem we've cannot know whether the system is working or not.
The most system is assumed to be successful, but is usually an assumption and that's we have an estimate on the most VAT gap.
We don't know whether the system is successful and for the intra-EU itself, we don't have also any any estimate so it would be very important.
That the commission assist member states developing, this is a calculation of the VAT gap.
Also, very important to explore the use of alternative technology solu solutions.
To tackle VAT fraud, maybe there could be assisting alternative system of split payments.
Using blockchain technology there are proposed paths, the KPMG KPMG and also proposal of professor E. Ensworth.
There very interesting proposals of course we have discussed with the commission the commission say that they are theoretical in practical way they come to solutions.
Didn't find any practical application in reality, also professor Lamas has made some proposals of using technology for the imports from the non-EU countries.
But are this this system accepted by many by other countries.
There are no practical experience, but I think we think that is worth it too to go deeper blockchain technology of offers opportunities.
This is something that is being explored also by the commission to manage the database of the i important stop shops.
Numbers to manage the validity of this i ioss numbers.
It's very important he which this is the future this is, the only way to tackle fraud with using the new technologies name for member states.
We like of course that they are start reacting to the fraud seniors, refacing EUROFISC.
Also monitor the trade-off compliant with the new threshold of ten thousand euros.
This is something that was highlighted by the Czech colleagues in their report.
And we took on board, also for the reason that they explained before.
To have a separate MOS and distances coordination function in the fellows, also to ensure that trader can only introduce the VAT rate, correct VAT rate in the MOS VAT returns.
Because if the trader introduces a wrong VAT rate, he receives only an advice, but the declaration can be sent anyway so it received an alert but it will be sent anyway.
Also perform the necessary checks upon receipt of the application for registration in the MOS to avoid this problem of double registrations.
Increase the audit activity in the MOS traders and distance sellers using administrative cooperation tools.
An employee of the periodic estimates on the compliance VAT upon e-commerce.
So if for this recommendation to member states, we would be very grateful if you could remember in your home countries about importance to follow our recommendations.
This is why we seek your cooperation in this matter, and that's all we know if you have any questions.
