If you don't mind.
I would like to ask you, the Polish colleagues, to give the presentation.
So, thank you.
I would.
I would like to tell you a few words about the regulations that to we implemented last year and during this year.
Some of them present, and euros of our research in a Warsaw.
So, so you know it briefly, I would like only to just refer to recall some of them.
And then I will talk about our previous audits and our findings.
So the first legislation to I would like to mention is the single audit file.
The introduction of the scene of this tool started three years ago.
But last year was that was the year of the final stage.
As the first stage was that this single audit file.
There was it was obligatory, and to be presented to the tax administration on demand.
And now this is automatic is an automatic system, and the information must be submitted by electronic means though, to all.
Since the first July of last year this is obligatory to all types of business entities.
And in the in 2016 it was obligatory for bigger companies then for medium ones, smaller ones and now for all entrepreneurs.
I will come back to this tool, because we've we found that is the most significant in the in the area of combating VAT fraud.
The second second legis legislation I'd like to mention is that so called fuel package.
And again, the legislation was introduced step by step, depending on the type of the entity.
The idea is that the license for fuel trading is granted only to entities established in Poland, or Polish branches of foreign entities registered for VAT in Poland.
The same type is allowed to benefit from the this expansion procedure in respect to the 
Polish community acquisition of fuel.
And the VAT results for the community acquisition of fuel immediately, after the goods were shipped to Poland, or excise duty suspension is finished.
The next legislation is that transport package.
I may say that the draft of law was based on our Hungarian colleagues experiences. Because as we know, the first law and this type of this first type of law was introduced in Hungary.
But in Poland we introduced system of the monitoring of that, the carriage of goods, only for particular types or categories of goods.
Generally speaking, the goods which are subject of excises - a fuel, tobacco and some others.
And the monitoring of the the transportation of this type of goods by public roads or by rail.
That means that every single transport must be notified before the transport again in the special system, the dedicated system.
And since last year, every transport is connected with the geolocation systems.
So every particle of truck is possible to be verified, about the route, the parking places et cetera.
And the Minister of finance.
For the Ministry of finance analyses full system of the big data provided by one of the public isti-.
As we know for now.
There could.
They could take many results and many, and they could find any any irregularities.
They could find business entities, which provide such a transport in a kind, in an abnormal kind, in the meaning of routes of the time et cetera.
And this year we are planning to audit, the Ministry of Finance is prepared to to verify and to use this analyses.
System is implemented in the meaning in the sense that all this all these entities, have to to register all of transportation.
And the system is ready and the meaning of the analysis, which is ongoing online, but we are not now for the moment and the Ministry of finance uses this information for the action and the tax administration.
Next legislation is something similar to the yeah colleague, my colleague presented yesterday.
So you go to a kind of a blacklist.
The blacklist means list of entities that we have removed from the VAT register.
And we have a system of based on the information given again online from banks and the other entities of the financial system.
The system allows to the service of Minister of finance to identify irregularities.
And the system is aimed at capturing abnormal transactions and providing information to tax authorities online.
And based on this information the tax administration may may block the account of a pow particular transaction.
If there is a risk of extortion of the amount higher higher than 10000 euros.
Next legislation is optional split payment introduced last year.
For the moment this is an option.
This is an option for the purchaser, if the one part of the contract uses this, then the way of payment is men mandatory for the supplier, obviously.
What is important is that if this split mechanism is used then the transferability of the tax payer is excluded and I will tell you about some numbers about using this payment mechanism in a second.
Yeah, that is that one.
The organisational, legislation and organisation tool as well, are coming from the Ministry of finance presented last year.
So we've got new national revenue administration based on previous free.
Previous free administration and I would go.
I would go to one administration, administrating all tax and custom in one system.
And the online registration system.
For the moment we've got the obligatory time of cash register systems.
The obligatory elements of this cash registers is that electroni is the electronic memory.
So the so they're able to verify on the base of the memory of the of the authorisation of the cash registers.
We are starting with the system of online registration for some sectors only.
First of all that is the legal services, viewers and only some particular sectors.
And that means preparing to build a central system kept by the head of the national revenue administration.
And in this system all these transactions should be registered immediately online.
While we are planning and discussing the implementation of is this obligatory split payment for for all sensitive taxpayers.
And that means, in fact, that we would like the tax administration, or the tax administration would like to replace the reverse charge by the split payments, the split payment mechanism.
The reverse charge and so the all those sectors in which the the reverse charge would join and several beat or biding, and all the sectors could be covered by this split payment mechanism.
As I mentioned, I will say a few words about the audit.
We conducted the audit last year.
And that term the period covered by the audit was quite long, because it was twelve years.
We were asked by the committee of finance of public finance, of the same chamber of Parliament to conduct the audit.
And our findings were as follows.
We had to state that the efficiency of the activity of Ministry of finance during this long period was different.
During the sub-period of this of these years, during the years 2010 to 2015 some insufficient efforts were taken by the ministry, the tax administration to improve the revenues.
One of the indicators the task of the audit was the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, over the tax incomes of a tax connections, the VAT collections.
One efficiency.
The efficiency of this supervision is the VAT gap.
During these years the VAT gap in Poland was on average 24 percent, which was about ten percent higher than the medium level of the medium countries.
That was one of the indications for us that the supervision was not effectively conducted.
We have got the information on the VAT gap in Poland and in other EU countries.
Here, we have got the numbers given by the European Commission and the Polish Ministry of finance.
And as you can see, the average European VAT gap is definitely lower than in Poland.
Despite the source of information, the numbers are quite clear here.
As I said, the main tool in our and the tax administrations opinion implemented during this period was the single audit file.
During the last two years, the tax administration gained the competence to use the databases to analyse them.
And for example, in 2017 4 million invoices were analysed automatically but only 30000 warnings were as a result of this analyse analysation process.
Last year, the number of invoices analysed was not too to to high, only five million, but more than 350 000 warnings.
That gave in fact.
That could be seen in the incomes because the stages of automatic analysing and then the warning means the warning sent by the text messages or emails, 
So without an official procedure or tax procedure, at set, etc cetera.
And this system.
The first stage, the automatic stage, gave us the results that the income, the incomes of VAT more than 150 million euro yearly, during these last two years 2017 and 2018.
The increase in income took place in the conditions of good of a good economic situation and the VAT collection improve from the wide package of legislation and organisational changes are organized in the do it last two years.
But we still think that one of the main sources of this improvement of financial results was the implementation of the single VAT file.
The results of the other two mechanism was as follows.
In 2018, the use of split them in mechanism was voluntary.
But we observed an increased payment in July of last year.
The taxpayers made 600, no sorry, 600000 transactions in December more than one and a half million of transactions using the split mechanism.
The value of tax paid using this big payment mechanism in July was half a billion euro in December one and a half billion euro. 
Overall in the period of July to December last year, the tax payers carried out more than seven million transaction using the split payment mechanism and the amount of tax special accounts of VAT amounted to approximately six billion euro.
One more information about tax administration activities.
Last year, the national tax, the national rev revenue administration carried out 30 percent less controls, than in 2017.
However, with fewer inspections, to protect the percentage of inspections that found irregularities increased.
This is the results of the introduced new and electronic tools, which helped identified the identity to be properly chosen to be the subject of control.
The decreasing number of controls was accomplished as I said by an increased number in the increase in the number of controls was accompanied by an increase in the number of analytical screenings, which is obviously less painful and time consuming for taxpayers.
And it's reset it's resulted in an increased of 100 percent last year compared to 2017.
So generally, in our opinion, the last few years in Poland  was a term of implementation of several legislation, and in total the results are sufficient.
However, we still have to remember that the economic surroundings were quite big.
So it is quite hard to divide the source of the income, because the results of the new organisations and legislation are just a results of the general economy.
That's all.
Thank you.
If you have any questions I will try to answer.
Thank-
