looks like a banana it is a banana it is a banana it is the essence of bananas i would be confused with this thing mm s how is everyone mmhmm okay hi hi so we are here for the detailed design meeting mmhmm so we will uh i will first present what we are going to do in this meeting then uh ive i will also take notes during this meeting and i will send you uh a summary then as usual we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work and uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product then we will uh evaluate the product and uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not mmhmm so d lets start with the cost aspect so so i look at the aspect discussed last time that is to say uh to have a standard battery to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera like a banana mmhmm and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros so which is uh good because we had a price gap of twelve point five euros mmhmm so for the financial aspect its okay we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert yeah okay so uh you can have my project in uh yeah just a four yeah you have a presentation participant four yes evaluation okay okay okay so you can go we can go through okay so i made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings so you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points okay we we talked about before okay so we we want to have a product fancy look and feel technologically innovative easy to use fashion easy to find in a room and robust uh and uh uh i have a scale of uh seven points yeah mmhmm yeah okay so i go through all the uh all the points here and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point two point or seven point yeah okay okay and after we ha we have an an average and uh we see mmhmm okay the okay uh so uh fancy look and feel what do you think okay maybe you can presen okay f between o one and seven maybe hold it so i think its uh very uh very nice i give it a i give it a five what do you think yeah so its between one and seven yeah seven is the highest uh seven is the mmhmm i will give a six i will give a a five and you sorry do you vote uh christine eh do you also vote no i just want to see something mmhmm maybe we all have to agree on a common yeah well we can very easily uh i think uh and need to as well no problem need to uh i dont know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f if its better or uhuh so this is your one is most i so it will have five point five average um well we can choose what we want yeah okay lets say that seven is the best or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm okay so so do note the grade we have five six for me five five and what whats your choice oh sorry six uh s you can how much what how much would you give on the fancy aspect on the fashionable aspect how much would you you dont answer to this uh questionnaire oh yes i mm i dunno mm i think six its a good uh yeah five point five average wa can mm okay okay well does it okay techne technological aspect i sorry okay so after the technological aspect so we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel yeah we have the wheel uh we also have the rubber material which make it uh like new also i think i would give a five its four four a four also because except for the wheel we dont have so much innovation yeah the rubber is uh a four okay d are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not i i yeah no huh no okay so whats your uh grade no four four so we have four four f and five we can put four yeah for twenty five yeah four everyone is okay or four poin four four yeah lets put four yeah okay doesnt it yeah i think so very easy to use do you think its easy to use i give a seven i think yeah six i would give a i would give a seven as well its very easy to use mm six for me also six so six point five six point five kay six six six point five okay okay is it fashion oh yeah its its f its fruit fruit shape seven i would say seven and is very very nice design yeah its fashion because its a fruit and we say that the yeah seven yeah we can we can put a seven here yeah yeah seven yeah yeah seven okay well we hope easy to find uh easy to find in a room i lost my banana i think you cant miss it yeah yeah okay uh yeah i think its cool i think we can put a six here we have the lightning or the lighting yeah we have the we dont sesh especially have the lightning but so its yellow so youll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely or yeah its okay i think its very easy to i would say seven yeah seven its hard to miss it six yeah okay is it is it robust yeah its rubber made of rubber i think its m its uh more rubber than uh other remote control uh f yeah its ru its rubber yeah yeah the only problem there might be which know i if its very sensitive they will i dont know yeah okay yeah yeah but it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material yeah so maybe we can put a six yeah mm six or five everybody is okay six five six is okay six yeah for me six yeah okay yeah yeah s now um so tadada we have to sum up everything twenty thirteen uh twenty twenty six point five uh seven thirty two thirty six thirty thir okay thats thats okay six six is a good yeah the be good uh if we say that seven its uh its the better and when uh s six sit six are good its a good uh p product i think yeah the top mm okay so six is a so its a good evaluation i think so will become eight soon its very promising yeah well its a bit biased we have a good price and uh huh yeah okay good so this prototype is quite nice because i saw uh some phones that were banana shaped uh wireless phones not mobile ones wireless for the house uh quite big also and they were selling something like a hundred euros two hundred euros yeah okay just a just a phone wireless mmhmm so having this at twenty five euros is uh quite attractive i think yeah i think the yeah but almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare yeah yeah its much more complex but okay so i think we can summarise so we have seen the prototype its very nice according to the work of our two designer the the the financial aspect were okay we we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five euros and make i make profit the the evaluation give satisfying result as well so i think we can move to the last part of the meeting so the cost is in the budget the evaluation is okay so i th i think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party start to eat banana i dont know if its provided by uh by the meeting staff mmhmm okay so congratulation yeah congratulations to the team nice product uh very well we worked together fantastically yeah i think it was a good collaboration uh aspect so what does the management say sorry what does the management say i think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well ah all it depends on who watch this meeting yeah we dont know yeah okay so good guys so see you for next uh successful project okay okay yeah fruits mm kay mm"}
