okay
mmhmm
so we are here for the concept design meeting
so we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision weve taken
uh i will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards
so each of you will uh show us the various investigation theyve done during uh previous uh hours
well then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task to have to be done before the next meeting
so last time we decided to have a simple interface
we also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button
channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple
we have also button for volume and to switch on off the tv
we have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no lcd no voice features
so now uh we will have three presentations
so the conceptual specification by industrial designer the specification of the ui by or ui okay
abdul alhasred is my name
and uh the last point is uh trend watching by market expert
so maybe we can start with uh industrial design
so this is the presentation
uh id you want
maybe i can switch slide uh on your request
yeah
i only v have three slides so
i just look at the mm um just this
on some web pages to find some documentation and i think a remote control is as i s mentioned previously you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control
yeah
so uh uh i was looking basically for that chip which is uh very very standard and uh i just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button
and um yeah we can change directly
yeah
in fact i have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control
the push button are usually extremely cheap but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor which seems to be quite expensive
okay
mmhmm
and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button
okay
uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button
yeah
but is it a significant price on the whole remote control
mm
because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control
yeah
yeah i i th but i dont think that uh we should we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money
so will will will this with uh including all possible things so buttons wheel and the chip be uh lower than twelve euros to produce
yeah
okay you received something hmm
also have to say did you receive the email about the voice recognition
but um thats all yeah
no
i havent chec mmhmm
yeah
you we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed
says yeah
it says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions
but i guess it could be i guess its possible
and could it be adapted
i mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command
okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff
yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff so if they already have it as uh as a chip then we we could use it
okay
yeah
okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news
okay
yeah but i think its yeah sorry i havent written my personal references
um the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button and if we could reduce that
okay
we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button
mmhmm
i have a question about that actually
um what is the purpose of the light
just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber yeah
is but but in th in the dark uh yeah but is going to be always turned on the light
you can easily find the button in the dark or so
it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think no
but if you move it then you have it you dont need to find it
hmm
you can see the buttons better of course
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
true
actually
but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement
as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light
yeah but you need another sensor for that right
yeah
again
yeah no its too expensive
i dont think that this is really expensive but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control when you want to turn off your device yeah a little bit
okay
mm
extra
yeah okay
mm
yeah but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so yeah
mm
mmhmm
but it can be uh battery consuming no
to have the light always on
a little bit
mm
well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations
yeah
okay
so uh my one it uh should be in the shared folder
yeah
so
it was last time i saw it
and it is
okay
so just move to the next slide
okay
so basically want very simple right
thats the major idea as simple as possible
yeah
yeah
so i just look at some current designs uh on the web of usually more complicated remote controls
and lets look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple
and in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we dont need and it become even simpler
yeah
um
so
and also does it uh fit well in hand
because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage
yeah
well this these uh these remotes are quite big so go to the next page so
we have all these buttons as you can see but most of them we just need the ones in the middle
yeah
yeah
yeah
so from the bottom or whatever is there uh the uh the numbers and then the top uh until the ten also this middle part and on the left one is exactly the same
yeah
yeah
so its basically more or less how we would like it with a big volume control big channel control and mute and power yeah
yeah
these are the basic thing
so its only the central part
so basically w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two
yeah
with a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part
yeah if you have for example i think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb
it could be on the right side for example
yeah
okay
yeah
because we dont have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have
and i think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because you open it it can break you ca you can do various things
okay
uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way
okay
s okay
so that theyre separate a bit yeah
will be down or okay
uh and its easy to press the other the big buttons but uh its not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either
mm
yeah i think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user
okay
alright you wont yeah
usually what i have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally dont mess with like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that
okay
yeah
that you want to protect a bit
and i think its uh its reasonable
okay
so i dont think yeah this is just the the wheel
we could use the some wheels can be pushed down could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want
mm
mmhmm
uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case
yeah
maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors
mmhmm
because otherwise its pretty standard apart the fact that its very simple
so maybe its worse to uh to have more expense on thats that aspect
to s mmhmm
yeah i guess the market researcher will tell us all about that
okay
so we can move to the is there any question
for designer of user interface
or we can move to the next part maybe and discuss afterwards
okay
okay i can go
can i
yeah
so now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um
so the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel
and um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative
okay
and the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use
so are things we are we have uh speak about before
mmhmm
yeah
yeah
and um so you you can go after
yeah
and there is a fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furnitures
so maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that or and the mm the material is expected to be spongy
okay
i support an apple
uh i dont know which material can be spongy and if you mmhmm
yeah
this is good also for yeah
well wou wou i think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing it it would work right
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think it is good also f to have a spongy material yeah
you can throw it to the television
yeah because its robust
okay its robust yeah
yeah
me too
hey thats a cool one
we could say that if you throw it you have a sensor and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off
when it d uh takes a shock
yeah uh sorry
ah its okay
not good
i know that they do that for alarm clock also
an and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that
yeah
you ca uh you can go uh before before yes
no
yeah
before
and you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel after is uh technological innovative and after the easy to use
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think its innovative to use the mm the wheel because i think no one else has
yeah
yeah thats why yeah thats why i think we have to keep that if its possible
has it
yeah
i think its it makes it both easy and both innos innovative
mmhmm
innovative
so i think its a good aspect and it should be kept
mm
how do we make it look cool is the question
cool fancy
yeah
we have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable
yeah
maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh things like that
what about um and for maybe look and feel what about a a piece of ice with blue led inside
mm
oh colour yeah
well the obvious thing is a banana i guess
oh i i i thought about a a pear for example
maybe yeah
you know the pear is like that and its its easy to to have in in hand and uh yeah
yeah and its ergonomic as well
a pear
the banana is also ergonomic
yeah
maybe pear yeah or something like that
or a fruit like that
i dunno
yeah
we can discuss that uh
d d is is there anything you want to add
is there any fruit that is spongy
i dont think so
i think we we can have like yeah a pear is good fit well or banana as you told
yeah
something like that
but thats not in the trend
you can make it um its not hard the metal
yeah
 the trend is spongy and vegetable fruits
yeah
yeah
i think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well
plastic
yep
so i think we can keep the wheel because its uh easy its innovative even if the cost is a bit higher and we also have to find a so a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have
yeah
what kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your tv with
mm
odi banana is also yellow so you you cant lost your remote control then
banana i think its a nice idea
because but you y you dont use the banana when the banana is curving like that but when the banana is curving like that with the wheel on the top and to control and here you have a a push button to yeah
yeah
yeah
two of the button yeah
yeah
yeah
but you dont have yeah
i think its a good idea yeah
yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve yeah and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side
yeah
so you can have it on on two sides and itll be cool no
yeah
i think its a good design and its innovative as well then
maybe we can keep the banana
and it will be very easy to find
you can put also vibrator inside
and everybody knows what is a banana
basically
if you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha oh yeah so so we will just use a a standard battery
ahha
you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company
yeah
yeah
yeah its really uh really a good point
i hope the students of management die but anyway
now who are recording this meeting
i think it so one second
so we have to take some decision on this aspect
so uh so for sorry for uh component so we have to think about those aspects sorry
yeah
and uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use
uh what do you mean by case
i think its the box that should be spongy bananas shape
yeah
uh i mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case doesnt matter
i just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box and thats it
the only th yeah
y yeah that can be in inside th in the structure
yeah yeah
yeah
but uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be i mean if its spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to i mean if its spongy then its going to move right
spongy also
so its going to be bend a lot
so if we try to push the buttons it you think its possible
oh no i think its possible
but no the button would be in fact it it should be something odd shaped with a spongy cover
yeah
okay
yeah
this is uh like the mmhmm
yeah
okay odd shape with spongy cover
and standard battery okay a chip imprint theres no specific problem
so we agree to put the wheel so it have to it has to be symmetrical
wheel on the top
button where do we want some buttons
well usually hold kay we want it to be good also for the lefthand users right
yeah
uh yeah but okay
sa lets say that th o it has to be basically you can only take two sides one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb
yep
yep
basically
or you could use use this one but i dont know if its very comfortable to use this one for the wheel
yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable
this for the wheel and then this for the buttons
yeah i think its okay for both right and left
should have the two sides
mmhmm
mm
so if the left we have the op wheel wheel buttons
i think you can turn it this way also
you can do both with both hands
yeah the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around the buttons are on the other side
i think its okay
so you cannot see them
well you you will get used to it
yeah
and moreover th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side because you have light on buttons
so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be y yeah i know but uh if you hold with your left hand and the wheel is here and the buttons are here then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side
yeah
no you you i think you will use it only on the right or left hand whether you are righty or lefty
i think for lefty its okay
i can do this movement and for righty as well
i think this doesnt change that much
okay
yeah
okay
maybe
yeah
so for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side
and and uh a wheel on the top
mmhmm
yeah
so the colour is yellow
i think its uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take yeah
so maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting
so have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision
and have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product
that is to say uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay
it seems to be fancy innovative and easy to use
mmhmm
so so to prepare the prototype i would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer uh work together
that would uh be better i think
yeah
and uh and so uh you will receive further instruction by emails as usual
mmhmm
so do you need to add anything
yes master
no
you feel okay
yeah
you feel uh free to express what you want to say
yeah
you dont feel too constrained
no
you dont feel free to answer this
maybe you can make uh uh mm okay
okay so see you
thank you
