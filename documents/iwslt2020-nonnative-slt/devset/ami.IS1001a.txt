how do you wear this thing
hmm
mm mm mm
not too many cables and stuff
original
is recorded
okay
okay so welcome everyone
so we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control
so i will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it
and uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process
so sorry
uh
just one thing
uh you said twentyfive minutes but i have something else to do uh so gotta have another meeting uh soon so maybe you could hurry up a bit its true
i have another meeting so if you could uh yeah
you have another meeting soon
so you have to be quick
yeah for the lawnmower project
okay
okay
so the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be userfriendly
so uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points
first it will be the functional design
third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design
so the functional design is to identify the main user needs the technical function the remote control should fulfil
and then we will move to f conceptual design where well specify the different component involved what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that
and then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice weve uh made in the second point
so i will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board
what an original idea
do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us
orangutan
okay thats good
no no n you should write y the name i think
n n you should if you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh ill let you uh comment
can i give you the no
but i dont have to say anything
when im drawing the orangutan
its an abstract drawing of an orangutan
okay its an abstract drawing
yes
i think its nice and original
i dont have a red colour
usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but i dont have red pen so yes
okay
you want to draw something christine
okay uh sorry
you have to imagine a little bit um
this sorry too uh
of course your animal is recorded so its not lost
yes
i know
is this uh ah okay its pretty
wha what is this strange beast
is it beautiful
is it a monster
do you know
its a cat
its a cat
isnt it
i thought these things did not exist
yes yes is it like that
me ah yeah
is it better
ah yeah does have a name
yeah
okay
its my cat
okay its your cat
yeah
the name is caramel
caramel
caramel
ahha
yeah
okay
olivier do you want to okay i go but next time youll do something im sure
and you i think im too short for the cables
next time i concentrate
im a bit short on cable
okay
so what could i draw
maybe i can draw like a very simplified cow
i dont know if it looks like a cow like a what
he looks like a bong
okay
sorry
no
quite squarey
scary
he also
i dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact i would say
mm
i i think we will be finished this uh is it for uh for putting a for logos no
okay so i hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control
thats i is there a matter for a new remote control
okay
lets move on
so here the uh financial objective of our project
that is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million euros
yeah if its trendy original i d fulfil the user needs
is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multidevice remote control
we have to discuss that point
ah this is not defined at all
on yeah you you can suggest points like this
ah okay
so what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple
so whats what are your ideas about that
maybe i can have the your opinion from the marketing side
well uh do we sell other stuff
uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us
okay so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device
yeah
do you agree
mmhmm
yeah
so maybe it should be for multiple devices
and uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil
i think we shouldnt have too many b for my part
no i couldn i cannot fi think of any requirements right now
i think if we dont have so many buttons could be nice
few buttons
okay
and do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark
might be a good idea
yeah
okay
and do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain what it shouldnt it should look like or things like that
something which is not squarey maybe uh not a box
mm
with rou okay
like for okay
something like that least fits in your hand
yeah
okay
yeah
the basic requirement
so
fit in your hand yeah
only a buck
and also it have i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh to to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall
mmhmm
waterproof
waterproof as well
and i think we should have a device sorry
maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others cant
maybe waterproof would be very original
havin having a waterproof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath
mm
that could be uh yeah but it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very yeah mayb b but maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well
b it seems uh so but uh if you dont have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f and and thats one of the thats one of the shock i mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that its going to break and they put some extra plastic around it
thats people they actually do it themselves
yeah
directly
i it will look a bulky in that case
yeah
yeah
maybe we can sell uh all that together so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well
that might be good uh track to follow
like as an optional thing
optional or selled with it
and i i think we should have something most of the time i i lose my remote control
we should have s uh special bu button on the tv to make the remote control beeping
yeah
maybe we can have uh but we dont design the tv
ah yeah
maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep
yeah
barks
yeah barks yeah
barks
so we can uh have a whistle uh remote control
yeah
yeah whistle
i dont know whistleable
whistle tracking
th whistle tracking yeah
whistle tracking remote control
thats a good idea thats very original and thats can uh improve
thats thats quite cool but uh of course we you dont normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right
yeah d d uh
so i its just going to add t to the cost
yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors
i think this is a good advantage
its cool
i think i like the idea but im not sure about the what you who is giving whos giving whos giving our budget
yeah
we have to ask yeah
whos yeah
we have to ask the quest of thats uh design to the uh industrial um designer
yeah
yeah
which is you
kay
yeah okay
okay so try to find that for next meeting
okay
so next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh
dont panic
dont pani
so so i will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed
mmhmm
so then i will ask the user interf interface designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons the the fact that is lighted or not things like that and what would be convenient for the user
mmhmm
and also um i will ask the market expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user
so
and then uh i will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon
mm
so
thank you i think thats all for this point
good
mmhmm
uh so we come back in five minutes
half an hour
anyway you will receive some messages
be careful
you eat it
does it move uh
okay but i dont know if it uh is still correctly uh well see
ah
