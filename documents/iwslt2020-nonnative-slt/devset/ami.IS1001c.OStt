P 509.90 511.16  So basically want
P 509.90 511.42  So basically want very
P 509.90 511.50  So basically want very simple,
C 509.90 511.82  So basically want very simple, right?
P 511.82 512.64  That's
P 511.82 512.78  That's the
P 511.82 512.94  That's the major
P 511.82 513.08  That's the major idea,
P 511.82 513.58  That's the major idea, as
P 511.82 513.76  That's the major idea, as simple
P 511.82 514.44  That's the major idea, as simple as
C 511.82 515.18  That's the major idea, as simple as possible.
C 515.18 515.34  Yeah.
C 515.34 515.52  Yeah.
P 515.52 515.72  So
P 515.52 515.86  So I

P 515.52 516.58  So I just look
P 515.52 517.70  So I just look at
P 515.52 517.94  So I just look at some
P 515.52 518.12  So I just look at some current
P 515.52 518.26  So I just look at some current designs
P 515.52 519.14  So I just look at some current designs uh
P 515.52 519.32  So I just look at some current designs uh on
P 515.52 519.62  So I just look at some current designs uh on the
P 515.52 519.78  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web,
P 515.52 520.34  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of
P 515.52 520.58  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually
P 515.52 521.46  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually more
P 515.52 521.60  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually more complicated
P 515.52 521.74  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually more complicated remote
C 515.52 521.92  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web, of usually more complicated remote controls.
P 521.92 522.00  And
P 521.92 522.16  And let's
P 521.92 522.24  And let's look
P 521.92 522.96  And let's look at
P 521.92 523.52  And let's look at two
P 521.92 523.58  And let's look at two of
P 521.92 523.78  And let's look at two of them
P 521.92 524.04  And let's look at two of them because
P 521.92 524.22  And let's look at two of them because uh
P 521.92 524.34  And let's look at two of them because uh th
P 521.92 524.48  And let's look at two of them because uh th even
P 521.92 524.72  And let's look at two of them because uh th even though
P 521.92 525.20  And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they

P 521.92 525.80  And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons
P 521.92 526.26  And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they
P 521.92 527.04  And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look
P 521.92 527.18  And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite
C 521.92 527.26  And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple.
P 527.26 527.54  And
P 527.26 527.68  And in
P 527.26 528.44  And in our
P 527.26 528.54  And in our case
P 527.26 529.00  And in our case we
P 527.26 529.08  And in our case we just
P 527.26 529.38  And in our case we just uh
P 527.26 529.50  And in our case we just uh reject
P 527.26 529.64  And in our case we just uh reject the
P 527.26 529.84  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons
P 527.26 530.22  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what
P 527.26 530.62  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we
P 527.26 530.72  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't
P 527.26 530.94  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need
P 527.26 531.14  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and
P 527.26 531.38  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it
P 527.26 532.38  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become
P 527.26 533.18  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even
C 527.26 533.28  And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler.
C 533.28 533.40  Yeah.
C 533.40 533.76  Um.
C 533.76 533.98  So.
P 533.98 534.16  And
P 533.98 534.48  And also
P 533.98 534.80  And also does
P 533.98 535.06  And also does it
P 533.98 535.22  And also does it uh
P 533.98 536.06  And also does it uh fit
P 533.98 536.40  And also does it uh fit well
P 533.98 536.56  And also does it uh fit well in
C 533.98 536.82  And also does it uh fit well in hand?
P 536.82 537.78  Because
P 536.82 538.20  Because it
P 536.82 538.54  Because it was
P 536.82 538.80  Because it was uh

P 648.24 650.18  We could use the some wheels can
P 648.24 650.38  We could use the some wheels can be
P 648.24 650.56  We could use the some wheels can be pushed
P 648.24 650.68  We could use the some wheels can be pushed down,
P 648.24 651.00  We could use the some wheels can be pushed down, could

C 655.76 655.96  Mm.
C 655.96 656.02  Mm-hmm.
P 656.02 656.18  Uh
P 656.02 656.34  Uh so
P 656.02 656.72  Uh so we
P 656.02 656.94  Uh so we could
P 656.02 657.34  Uh so we could just
P 656.02 657.58  Uh so we could just basically
P 656.02 657.88  Uh so we could just basically use
P 656.02 658.42  Uh so we could just basically use one
P 656.02 658.56  Uh so we could just basically use one just
P 656.02 658.90  Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel
P 656.02 659.06  Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and
P 656.02 659.24  Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh
