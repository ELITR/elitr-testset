we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first i will show the agenda so we will uh i will take notes during this meeting so i will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification technical function design and working design then i will uh present you some new project requirements i received from uh the management board then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then i will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting of the of the process so uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did mm f do you want to start make a start yeah you can start so cable camera you have uh powerpoint should be in my in their folder no ah yeah maybe there up okay who are you um at three i think no mm ouch and we have a technical problem uh okay do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe it is possible you put it on yeah no it was somewhere in something like this i dont remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami or something what do you have in short cut go up participant two yeah go up again no go back you have no over uh maybe messenger ami messenger okay no there is nothing theres no we have a technical problem lets go and check yeah ill go and check otherwise could you just describe by hand okay with the the whiteboard yeah if you remember yeah but thats yeah yeah so uh basically what we want here is a remote control right so um the question well first of all what to control so most people want to have a a remote for their hifi and tv and stuff like that mmhmm and but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house mmhmm mmhmm yeah yeah so theres a project i think called x house or something like that that does that uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff mmhmm so there is one that is one thing the other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah okay mmhmm so i think it should be a package in that case uh so the user interface will consist of two parts one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices a set of buttons for special navigation in space a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access mmhmm mmhmm okay yeah what do you mean by linear access then like a video tape goes forward backwards uh fast and stuff yeah ah um okay so special navigation linear access random access and theres a fourth one no mm so the better now for special navigation yeah for special navigation for example you might have a tv in the menu and you going to change yeah okay then linear access then random access uh mm yeah and also parameter changing ah yeah parameter okay so if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff okay okay okay and and voice command did you uh okay voice command w we could specify anything we could assign any button a command to any button if we have enough processing power i guess so okay yeah okay yeah so thats uh that close your investigations yeah uh yeah i think so okay not so far okay maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with i dunno if i can open it yeah um i dunno if you can open the uh m is not here maybe you can s its messenger no uh in yeah okay no in document mm computer yeah in which folder where did you put it here here shortcut to ami shared folder mm but its not um maybe you can send it to me by email just to participant one at ami mmhmm yeah i can do that i will try to show it to everyone that would be more comfortable okay um you send it its participant one yeah uh this is this email im designing the user interface okay you can uh okay so maybe i can switch slides when you whenever you ask that will be more convenient yeah so okay functional requirements okay so you can you can go okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay mm yeah and here i have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more nice more kind eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to its not good so okay so its not in theory but i i can i can say yeah we can just keep doing that yeah fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot so mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks okay um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control okay so all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or yeah okay okay so fewer buttons maybe would be good f not many buttons and uh and uh uh u useable buttons okay but what kind of remote controls did you look at sorry what kind of task was it it was a tv yeah uh most for most is tv yeah yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a tv remote control according to new requirements i received from the management bo i will present them in the following huh uhhuh ah good okay kay you can go so so there are other frustrations expressed by users so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to to find it yeah to find it yeah um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control yeah so they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use mmhmm okay and uh remote controls are bad for rsi um i dunno what is her other side other side yeah yo wa your wrist it i can become painful you can have tendonditis oh yeah yeah i did not knew that if you also up on a computer in a strange position okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah ergonomic but uh yeah have to say ha ha its your job oh uh uh sorry got a message from microsoft okay um before that i i have some some some thing uh to say before um we know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel yeah yeah yeah yeah um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that okay yeah mmhmm mmhmm okay so its better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and very accessible yes yeah this function should be very uh accessible yeah okay thats right this is the main function okay so then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an lcd screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions yeah yeah yeah the first question so you know that um for the younger its very important to have the s yes and speech recognition to have lcd and voice and uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot tv and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh okay so maybe we we can have a speech recognition in yeah maybe this this is important yeah moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view i think or so mm mm yeah okay and if there is th the conclusion now so as we say before i think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark its its a good thing okay uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to an i s no yeah yeah mmhmm okay okay these are the user requi yeah i dunno if you see something else important or mm im just thinking of some thing um we want to have a no i dont know if this is a good idea we want to have a a general remote control for everything no no no we w it seems that we no want to have a tv remote control okay from the management board i receive an email mm yeah cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control yeah yeah yeah yeah mm i its not true i think the the second claim that you put no no that it would be too long to develop yeah i think that should be the same oh yeah because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on tv more where it seems that the market is more important so maybe its a good decision i dunno whats your opinion i have uh ive no idea i mean i should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it i dont think uh yeah finish tonight yeah okay but basically yeah maybe i can continue with my presentation it would be al you you but i think we have some technical problem or so yeah okay yeah yeah so im just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do i dont know if fact yeah but do i have oh yeah mm now i have enough cables like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff okay so im just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy we just have sorry im going like that okay are you okay im just going to describe basically we have a a battery a power supply here after that we just have um user interface lets say that um something like that which could be um a lcd lets say or um an array of push button something like that push button or a lcd after that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip so i say uc and i feed that to uh led which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component and so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy uc is the central unit yeah okay yeah y its a its this just a chip which does all the um numerical numerical computation according to your display computation okay and so for us uh this is quite easy we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television okay so for us this is quite easy okay so this is quite easy yeah um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple yeah of course of course there is not that much constraints this will think this will take more time to develop also yeah and um but for a standard one this is really easy its a question of one month and so on s no no no no i say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that soon to have a you s you speak about with voi voice control standard button one yeah so the only time problem is the sp voice recognition yeah yeah definitely yeah so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now i would say ten years i would say uh about eight months to have the first results okay so i its a bit long yeah yeah i can um one month for the standard one with button yeah even if we have a lcd display yeah even i mean that this is really standard devices now um eight for uh speech recognition okay yeah okay so we can take this into account so who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition but we dont have time to market and also how much uh i think during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldnt we shouldnt go up to twelve point five euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a yeah but how many yeah yeah it will i think we should contact management euros yeah yeah well well each unit is is sell uh twenty five euros uh how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no one hundred thousand units eh chips were gonna need chips right yeah yeah how much will it cost for one hundred thousand usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip okay because we are it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting so you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition yeah we can mmhmm yeah okay so no it doesnt okay four million okay maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have mm um i just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta yeah i i will continue is it um you say that i dont remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say thats its quite difficult to to to use the remote control well ask your question if you want mm yeah do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason oh to to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that would j uh yeah w i i think they they say that its uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it its its okay mmhmm mmhmm okay and but yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want but yeah its not intuitive first you say that i want i have six button yeah mhhmm a a lot of people are uh if you have the lcd screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure i mean imagine i uh so its really something for the expert user yeah yeah but but also it seems that yeah yeah okay so i mean there are markets and markets i think the young people are th uh are uh christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah yeah yeah so for our young people uh it will be cool they can be able to use it th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it i guess i dont know if there is study about that yeah mmhmm maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product mm yeah yeah yeah mm mm and there are another thing is that if we make something thats simple and easy to use thats bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else yeah yeah all right yeah otherwise if its different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first yeah yeah but also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons mm mmhmm so we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control yeah losed lose it etcetera mmhmm these these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop mm mmhmm so but le let us see first the new requirement so we dont have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we dont have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff but teletext is just one button you you just write the write the numbers yeah so well yeah so will you add with the channel keys right so so anyway we dont have to include this feature because its its not used any more by users they prefer to s yeah i am im sure that uh it dont like but uh i dont see just one button so i dunno if i one button is still one more button if if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors mmhmm well anyway i have this point we can discuss also um so as as i told before uh it would be better if its only for the tv um because we want to be quick on on the market and then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product so this is the the key point so before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera capital mm so do you um so so from from the the marketing expert i think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so i think we have to do something very simple and i think we all agree on that point no mm mmhmm mm well if it is going to be just a tv remote control it is going to be very simple yeah okay so yeah the key point here is simple maybe so few buttons channel volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that well if its going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control there is no other function that i can see really yeah maybe switch tv on and off yeah uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us or something yeah volume maybe a mute button and then on off button mm and thats all uh i know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping mmhmm mm i know tha i discovered that when i did a quick look uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now you have a button you you press it and this is uh the previous channel which has come back its a memory yeah okay yeah this is cool maybe we can include that also previous previous channel button so we have like channel button the previous channel button the volume button plus a mute button and uh just the the traditional on off button mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm and uh and of course the channel changing buttons yeah i i talk about that yeah how should they how should we implement that because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental yeah incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them mmhmm lets say that we can do something like that this is uh incremental but once you press it for a long time you go five by five we go faster to go fa to go faster mm mm its an interesting idea that if you press it for a long time it does something else in general so if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time no yeah doesnt work does it maybe we should have also a digit button yeah maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands change channel to eight no maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental i dunno bec because if you have the uh well if its useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental yeah because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only its not uh it isnt worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one yeah yeah yeah so i think we need also digits okay maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and yeah yeah or we can do something like that we can design the remote control to have access you know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y you yeah a kind of joystick mmhmm yeah hey i just thought this thing there is a i mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel yeah yeah yeah maybe we can have a wheel for incremental yeah okay so have a wheel for incremental have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected and uh yeah i think this is the basi and do we do we have a no a wheel is better mmhmm mmhmm on the lower side i think it you have to turn it no if we do that or a or a ball yeah not a a wheel but a ball and you say uh to yeah yeah i would say the wheel is better because of that because its uh its its not like a volume which is smooth yeah what is the expert of uh okay the channels change one by one yeah so you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit yeah the yeah yeah yeah thats a good idea well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark i think because most people lost their remote control s quite its quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel okay yeah even if i led uh or a if if its the lcd feature uh whatever yeah a blue a blue led and we sell that um yeah and do we put an lcd display yeah because it was important for young customers if you remember i think its only put on if cou have multi function yeah if you do not multi function then there is no p point in having lcd just increase the cost okay the user does not have an advantage really so no lcd mmhmm hmm and so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process okay well if its going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool it would because a user could say cnn for example and it would go cnn mmhmm mm yeah that would be cool but eight months is really long and maybe we can just uh okay yeah ten years mmhmm so um i i will uh i will so i we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email i think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent so thank you for uh your suggestion and i i will make a summary of that meeting that i will put in the shared folder you cant see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided okay okay okay uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether yeah that would be easier mm what is the folder that you put yours in and did it it did work no no it did not work no no she send it to me by email ah yeah i dunno i dunno it mm okay so maybe this is better to send it by email okay what is your email okay so yeah i im its in the first uh email so im participant one at ami uh where is that its here at participant one okay participant one at ami okay so see you after lunch break kay thank you well during lunch break actually so next time we should have a fight how about uh management or something who happens to be your friend"}
