Mister President the floor is yours.
Dear President Kala, a distinguished guests, dear friends, dear colleagues.
I am very honoured as President of the European Court of Auditors em I am very pleased, that our institution has the opportunity to take part in this e em interesting conference today.
I would like to convey my warm congratulations for this initiative to president Kala and all those working in this event in the audit office.
It is a timely one and I think that the introductory remarks that are in inviting guests to take part of this exercise are indeed very interesting.
Public auditors need to keep up with development in government and society if they are to continue to make a difference throughout our e audit work.
Without a doubt government and society are changing, and are changing very fast and increasingly becoming more sophisticated.
That is largely the result of transfo the transforming difference that information technology is having in s the across the world.
And new technologies are also empowering individuals and they are in a way changing a the citizens expectations of the government.
And what now citizens expect from governments is that the government uses the new technologies to deliver ever more efficient and effective services.
But citizens also expect that governments are then, more transparent and more open.
So this leads to what we can say a by-product that makes that this more available data about the government, how it works a what it does than ever before.
And that mountain of data is getting bigger and bigger all the time.
And these is a consequence on auditors.
As auditors we face more records to audit, more government reports to analyse and also more competition from our stakeholders attention.
And this has important implications for what we audit, how we audit and the way you communicate the results of our work.
And this is something I was strucked em by this year meeting em in March of the Global Audit Leadership Forum, there supreme audit institutions around the world a identified the same challenge and we realised that we were were looking for ideas on how best to respond to these challenges.
And there is one thing we we were worried, at least, there was concerned consensus that we need, as auditors, to innovate.
And we need to help governments to turn the big data into better information.
'Cos one thing is to have data and another thing is to have information on what the government is doing --
And transform this in greater knowledge for citizens about the results delivered by governments and the wiser decision making.
So this is I think the big challenge that big data puts to public sector auditors, transforming data into information, information into knowledge.
It raises many issues that I very much look forward to to hearing during the discussions of today by so many distinguished participants around Europe and from the Supreme Audit Office.
So let me thank again you president Kala for an inviting a a for this important event and I wish everyone an interesting and fruitive conference.
Thank you for your kind attention.
