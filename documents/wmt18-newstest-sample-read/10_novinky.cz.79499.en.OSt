A bodybuilder had an unbelievable 14 doping substances in his body.
And he still didn't win.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample from 23-year-old Ippolita revealed a large collection of illicit aids - from steroids to diuretics and medicine for Parkinson's or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mixture did not help him, and he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year ban and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record among all the athletes ever caught.
The third league player apparently began to take steroids a year earlier, when he got addicted to bodybuilding.
