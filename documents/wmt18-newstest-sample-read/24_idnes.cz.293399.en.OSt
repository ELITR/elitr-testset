A biker riding around the pavements and park and ends up flipping over.
The biker aroused attention with a reckless ride along the streets, pavements and parks in Úsovice.
When the patrol began to follow him, he decided to drive in the direction of Stanoviště.
"Police officers were combing the city very carefully when he lost control while driving on one of paths to Mariánské Lázně. He entered a field with the motorcycle, and then crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, and carried the injured biker to a hospital in Pilsen.
Eventually the police discovered that the biker did not have a driving license, and that the licence plate on the motorcycle had been stolen, its serial number rubbed off and the manufacturing label removed.
As such, it is possible that the vehicle was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test did not reveal any alcohol in the driver's system, but a positive result was found for methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
