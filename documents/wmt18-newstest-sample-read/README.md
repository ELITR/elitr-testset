# Subset of WMT18, Read Sentence by Sentence

This dataset was created by Peter Polak and a colleague of his.

It consists of Czech articles in WMT18 newstest, which were read sentence by
sentence in individual recordings. A few sentences had more sound versions but we took simply the first one. The sentence-level recordings were then
concatenated in a loss-less way in the original OGG format. Artifacts like
mouse clicks at sentence boundaries are audible.

The same articles were read by Czech native speaker in Czech and in English (where the speaker is non-native).

The dataset can thus serve for SLT evaluation in both direction: English or
Czech source sound to the other language.
