The Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development, Tomislav Ćorić, was a guest on Dnevnik Nova TV, where he commented on current topics.
The first among them was today's protest of entrepreneurs. 
It is expected that in the situation of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, there is a collective frustration that must come to the fore from time to time. 
That is why I understand the desire of some entrepreneurs who are dissatisfied with this closure," said Coric. 
"I will return once again to the key reasons for the closure, which I hope will not last long - it is, above all, care for the lives and health of our people," Coric added.
On the sale of coffee outside at kiosks and petrol stations while cafes selling it in this way are closed, he states that Croatia has chosen a more liberal way of fighting the pandemic. 
That is why I believe that in a few weeks we will be able to relax our measures, if such figures continue, and start functioning in a more normal way. 
Therefore, I believe that our path and this direction was justified.
Our results are much better than most European countries." , pointed out Ćorić.
As for the claim of the entrepreneur that the aid is late, he says that there would have been no delay if the papers had been submitted to the CES in the correct way. 
Grants for the 11th month have been paid in full, grants for the 12th month will be paid by the end of this week.
After that, grants for January will follow," announced Ćorić. 
As for the protesters' calls for him to try to survive on 4,000 kuna, he says: "This is a legitimate message. I would agree if everyone in Croatia lived on 4,000 kuna for the next six months. There is not a single reason against it."
He says that Martina Dalić is an expert who will lead Podravka for the next year until the expiration of the term of the current Management Board.
"In her appointment, all shareholders agreed. 
 Martina Dalic has her earlier history even before leaving the government. 
She influenced Croatia not to experience an economic collapse in 2017 due to the collapse of Agrokor," Coric said. 
He believes that her return will not harm the Government. 
If that happens, the only thing I can guarantee for Martina Dalic is that she will do her best to make Podravka in a better position on the day of her departure than when she came," Coric said.
Answering a question about the Croatian Chamber of Commerce. 
The minister said that the parliamentary majority had agreed to come out with a proposal to reform the Croatian Chamber of Commerce, which would "assume both organizational, functional and financial moment vis-à-vis the relief of our entrepreneurs".
We are doing a comprehensive pension reform. 
We have changed several laws where the pensions of our retirees are higher. 
The one who has the lowest pension has an additional 3 percent higher. 
You can retire and return to the labor market and keep your pension, the investment of pension funds has expanded, "the Prime Minister said.
He spoke of a referendum initiative that was collecting signatures against pension reform just in time for the European election campaign. 
According to Plenković, part of the blame for this lies with the media, which give people pragmatic information.
It is necessary to say something important and relevant about what the unions asked for and what we accepted. 
They came with 700,000 signatures, it could have been, say, the referendum on Milanovic in 2014, but the unions were probably busy, so they did not collect signatures for the referendum. 
Unprovoked, made right in the European campaign, "he said.
"Then for some other governments, say in 15 years, they will think about which tax to replace the 18 billion kuna that does not come from contributions. 
We have to plan for the long term. 
We had good will to make fiscally sustainable pension reform.
 But we will not go against what it demands. 700,000 people, "the prime minister said.
Salaries in the state and public sector increased by 18.5 percent, in education another 4 percent
Asked about another recent event this year - the strike of educators, the Prime Minister reiterated that in the mandate of this Government, in the last 4 years, consistently through negotiations on TKU supplements, salaries have increased several times, by a total of 18.5 percent in the state and public sector.
People in education another 4 percent.
When did that happen? 
There has never been such an increase in Croatia. 
This consistent, with healthy growth, without indebtedness with tax relief. 
Something like this has never happened in Croatia before," said Prime Minister Plenković.
He said that he thinks a lot about how to work for Croatia at all times, for every Croatian man. 
And how to reach people with the truth in the digital age.
You have some people informing themselves on social media some people superficially read what you superficially tell them. 
We may need to better communicate what we've done.
Some people are impressed by the false information they served by political opponents for years, "Plenković said.
All party members engaged in the presidential campaign.
Speaking about the presidential campaign, he said that the HDZ backed Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović at his suggestion in June.
The support is unique and complete. It runs its campaign. 
It involves all the people in the HDZ in the campaign. 
It is normal for everyone to support it, especially those who are top officials," he says.
On the political scene, you have a president who has made significant achievements for Croatia in five years. 
In all areas that are important for the presidency. 
Her opponent is a man who was a bad prime minister.
He had a government that additionally indebted Croatia," he said.
To the conclusion that not everything is black and white with public debt and borrowing figures, Plenković says that everything is black and white.
Absolutely everything is black and white. 
Yes, it is one hundred percent black and white, especially if I compare it with what I am doing as prime minister and this HDZ that I have been leading since 2016," he points out.
This government has achievements in all segments, claims Plenković, and on the claim that the candidate in the second round barely made it, Plenković believes that they have a communication problem.
We have to present the facts to people
It is very important to distinguish the true from the false, the truth from the lies. 
We have had a communication problem here for several years.
I tell you this as an expert who knows what we are doing .
And one of the reasons why this is so is that we have Milanovic who lies continuously, even about me personally. 
Then it takes over the far right and pollutes the space and lies to the voters and misleads people, "he points out.
Prime Minister Plenković also answered the question of which is the "real Croatia" that would vote for Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović.
A Croatia that will recognize between these two candidates who are in the second round someone who has results and someone who has no results, the one who is inclusive and the one who is exclusive. 
Who divided Croatia into us or them? Is that what the HDZ is doing?" , the prime minister said, adding that this is a campaign in which people need to be made aware of what is true and what is not.
The education unions have announced that in their referendum almost one hundred percent of the members rejected your modest offer with a two percent increase in the salary supplement and that the strike is going on! 
This could ruin the whole school year, and especially complicate the implementation of the matriculation exam, but you don't seem to consider yourself responsible for that at all?
I understand that some union representatives want to achieve as much as possible for their members, in this case the unions of primary and secondary education. 
But the government must take care of society as a whole
What we put on the table as an offer to unions is six percent for all. 
Plus, the obligation of the Government is to consider a joint regulation on coefficients, in which there are a lot of injustices and illogicalities, so let's see what they should be like in the future. 
" 2 + 2 ", the new arrangement was" 3 + 2 ", 11.5 percent so far ... And with the new offer we will reach 18.3 percent salary increase in the state and public sector by the end of 2020, plus tax relief. 
Their salaries will increase by approximately between 1,300 and 1,600 kuna during the mandate of this Government, "the Prime Minister replied.
It is not disputable, it is disputable that the strike is not conducted because of the increase of the base for everyone, but because they have a lower coefficient than other public services.
And then we offered two more percent that the unions could sign right away.
Plus the decision until November 15 was paid for the days in the strike, after that no. 
That package is in line with our policy of raising salaries, raising standards.
You have a government that increases salaries, we have moments when we negotiate something. 
The basic collective agreement solves the basis. 
It is the competence of the Government, it is the one that unilaterally decides on the decree. 
At this point I don’t want to change the whole fiscal policy, we spend as much as we earn.
Okay, you inherited the system, but you didn’t change it, you didn’t even try.
It's not true that we didn't try
We tried twice, we failed to reach a consensus.
There are certain, very sensitive elements within the Government itself.
You don’t want to offend anyone.
And don't do that. We've done things that benefit both teachers and professors. Education is important to us.
And this year no budget item is smaller, the state is not saving anywhere. 
The box office is filling up, but it’s also spending, some say you spend like “drunk billionaires”
And there will come a time when the economy will no longer grow like that.
We were thrilled as the Government when we paid the 4.5 billion kuna guarantees of some previous Governments, we were terribly thrilled that we nevertheless achieved a budget surplus.
We have healthy economic growth that is not on debt, we are reducing public debt all the time. 
You have not reduced public debt.
It's not true, it's two billion less, ask Minister Maric. I claim we are.
The bond that was refinanced the other day had an interest rate 10 years ago above six percent, we have now refinanced it by one percent.
Why didn't others return the investment credit rating, get out of the excessive budget deficit ... Is it all a coincidence?
Do you know that we are at the back of Europe in terms of real GDP?
We have too big a state administration, we get criticism from the European Commission, the World Bank 
We have an expensive and, worst of all, inefficient state administration. 
Four years of mandate are almost over, you haven't done anything about it.
With the first of January comes a big reform. The transfer of offices in the counties merges with the counties.
Some will go to work maybe something else, some will retire. 
We have thus reduced the number of people, strengthened the county system, I went with the policy of fiscal decentralization, which means that we have given local governments three billion kuna in the last two budget years.
We have almost two thousand new veterans, so is that normal, 25 years after the war
Nothing has been destabilized because of that, I guarantee you that
People from the ministry explain it down to the smallest detail, there is no drama, it is respect for those who have given the most for this country."
It's not that anyone remembered to be a veteran. 
As for the budget of the Ministry of Veterans' Affairs, we have increased it by 50 percent since the beginning of the mandate. 
There were injustices, gaps, open issues that have not been resolved
We are problems that also existed in a financially stable way. . 
Nothing has destabilized the financial system as a result. 
When we talk about spending money, HŽ Infrastruktura was executed for 22 million kuna because they did not pay a debt of 5 million. 
The Ministry of Science and Education paid an additional nine million kuna for the tablets due to an improperly conducted public tender.
Those who made the mistake will be held accountable
Each of the ministers must report when something happens. 
You brag about tax relief, but nominally citizens pay more.
Look, we have relieved ... We are paying nine billion kuna less in our term.
Criticized for not doing enough, and you have space now because you have a great economic momentum
I think we're just so bad now we wouldn't give S&P and Fitch an investment rating and we wouldn't be out of shortfall.
Look at this responsibility: at today's session of the Parliament, a rebalance was adopted, the budget for 2020 was adopted with projections for 2021 and 2022, the Law on Public Holidays was passed ... All this today. 
Last week the minimum wage was raised, in the term of this government it was increased by 100 euros, the average salary is more than 800 kuna higher ... "
You are lucky with economic growth.
Well, we entered the European Union, the market opened ...
And HDZ or I did not contribute to EU membership. Everything that is positive is along the way, and what is wrong is up to us.
Obviously you are not enough, the figures show that they are the same as during the time of Zoran Milanović.
Aren't you a problem with a thin majority
You can't have 130 seats in this electoral system. 
Today there was a purge in the Zagreb branch, eight members of the HDZ were expelled.
Things are extremely simple here.
I have been the president of the HDZ for almost three and a half years, we were in trouble, we overthrew our government, the chances in the polls were meager. 
We won, formed the government, despite everything we are here.
Topics, still from afar say ‘it’s good with you, better than before’
It concerns the HDZ, discussions, consultations ... More experienced veterans say that it has rarely been done in such a democratic way.
Cultural criticism, disagreement, that's ok.
Hate speech is impossible, it cannot pass. 
You have called a presidential election. 
Zoran Milanovic said the December 22 date was a theft.
It’s not enough for me for a candidate with the character of crying too much at first.
Let us remind the voters. Do you think someone wanted them to be presidential just around Christmas and New Year? 
On December 10, 1999, President Tudjman died. That is why the elections are in December. You have precisely defined constitutional deadlines. "
You are passionately entering into conflicts with Zoran Milanović, and he also likes to fight with you. Do you miss him as a political rival?
I have so much work and responsibilities, I do this along the way, if need be.
But even with Bernardic, the SDP came close to a three percentage point difference.
You have your polls so look back. When was the ruling party at 28 percent in the last year of its mandate?
Property card scandals also ruin your rating. 
Every now and then one of the ministers, now the chief state inspector, does not know how to fill in the card. 
Look, everyone is fulfilling themselves, I have no insight ... If mistakes happen, they are corrected.
Is Andrija Mikulic in a conflict of interest
He leads and leads the campaign of Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović in Zagreb, and is the chief state inspector. 
It is not his job to raise money, it is not his job. 
The same applicants have such rhetoric. 
We have watched, discussed such a conflict of interest in a formal sense, apart from your optics there is no.
I ask anyone who has any clue that he will be forced to finance the campaign or the inspector will come to him, let him come to me personally, we will solve it.
First you wanted to hire the Parliament for the EPP rally, you defended that and finally gave up.
That the EPP presidency comes to the Croatian Parliament, to one of the committee halls for two hours, or that a political assembly comes to the plenary hall in the week when the Parliament does not What is the conflict of interest
What, then, is the difference between a wedding or a political gathering
Speaking about today's decision of the Government to change the Ordinance on the non-taxable part of receipts from 2,500 to 7,500 kuna from December 1, the Prime Minister assessed that this is an opportunity for all employers who want to reward their workers in some form, to do so, practically for two weeks.
I think it's a very good measure. Many employers wanted something like that and I think we reacted well to employers and workers ", said Plenković.
Asked if he thinks that this measure will keep workers, in those sectors such as tourism and construction from which people leave, Plenković answered that it is not about the 13th salary, but it can be Christmas, Easter, regress, anything from non-taxable receipts, that is, giving employers tax-free.
I think it's very good. Many of them wanted it and all those who have these funds at their disposal, maybe now that there is no tax on it, it will be easier for them to decide to give an additional reward to their employees. And that was the point of this measure, "he stressed.
We agreed on a lot during our visit to China
Plenković pointed out that Croatia and China turned a new page when China Road and Bridge Corporation won the tender for the construction of the Pelješac Bridge.
The trip to China is very well and thoroughly prepared.
 It was my fifth meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, a man who will come to Croatia with his delegation and businessmen in the spring. 
We will host a large summit of China + 16 Central and Eastern countries. 
We had talks with a number of Chinese state-owned and private companies, "Plenković said, adding that a lot had been agreed during the trip.
We spoke with their railway company, as well as the world's largest shipbuilding company
The Chinese will send their delegation that also deals with shipbuilding. 
We talked about investing in wind farms. 
You have a project near Senj, the Chinese company Norinco. 
We spoke with Huawei, which is just as big in the ICT sector as Microsoft, "Plenković said.
He added that Huawei has already sent a letter of intent and wants to be one of the Croatian state's partners in the digitalization process.
They want to help us keep up with the fourth industrial revolution, in the best possible way.
They are advisors to many governments, and they practically provide solutions from what goes into the country, from cables to clouds ", said Plenković.
Healthcare is the most difficult to reform
When asked about the situation and debts in health care, he answered that the Government managed to give 400 million kuna to health care with this rebalance.
Last year we gave more, 1,300,000 kuna. In that year, health care did not generate new debt, which is very good. 
Rationalization and accessibility, that's all we are working on. 
Part of the legislation related to health is the next reform that is being prepared and will also go before the Government and Parliament ", announced Plenković.
Asked if he was satisfied with the work of Health Minister Kujundzic, he replied that health care was the most difficult of all to reform.
Most drugs, and we can freely say that many devices used in health care are certainly not cheaper than before. 
We as a society are used to the availability of health services. 
We are looking for a solution in this equation
You have seen the debates in Parliament. ", stressed Plenković, recalling the failed opposition initiative to recall Minister Kujundžić.
Responding to a query on the Global Compact on Migration, Plenković said that the document does not have the character of an international agreement, and was launched at the UN General Assembly two years ago, when the New York Declaration was adopted.
As far as I know, after the invitation of the UN Secretary General to President Grabar Kitarović to participate in that meeting in Marrakesh, she accepted that invitation and wanted to come. 
What has changed in her attitude towards that document, I do not know so far, "he said.
120 million kuna start of aid, EU assistance in repairing damages is also expected
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Zdravko Marić said that HRK 120 million in aid to earthquake-prone areas would be paid today, he also expected EU assistance in repairing the damage, and asked citizens to pay for help through official channels, because fake invoices had appeared.
Those 120 million kuna are just the beginning of the aid, and it will be approved at today's session of the Government from the budget stock, said Marić in the show of the Croatian Radio "A sada Vlada".
Yesterday, a redistribution was made within the budget, the largest part of that, 110 million kuna will go from the state budget, and ten million from the Environmental Protection Fund to the counties.
The largest part will go to Sisak-Moslavina County, but also to Zagreb and Karlovac 
We will work on finding additional sources of funds from European funds, the Solidarity Fund, through international financial institutions, "Maric said.
When asked who the 120 million kuna is intended for, Maric said that the money will be sent where it is most needed, to the county level.
European Commissioner for Crisis Situations arrives in Croatia
Today, the European Commission Commissioner for Crisis Situations is arriving in Croatia, which means for Marić that we will most likely receive a new tranche of money from the European fund, which is planned for such crisis situations.
He reminded that the European Union had shown that it was behind us in the case of the Zagreb earthquake in March, as well as that the Solidarity Fund had already paid 684 million euros for that case.
He still does not know whether the reconstruction of the Sisak area will go through the existing law on the reconstruction of Zagreb or whether a new legal act, ie a law, will be drafted.
Marić appealed that the help of citizens and companies be donated exclusively through official channels, the Red Cross and the like.
Also, a State Treasury account will be opened today at the Government session, through which money will be able to be donated.
He warned that individuals are opening fake accounts for help, but he also hopes that state institutions will suppress it.
Marić also said that the situation with state goods stocks is good and that large Croatian companies are appearing that are ready to help citizens from vulnerable areas.
Regarding the state of finances for this year, he said that the fall in GDP will be between eight and nine percent, and the budget deficit is projected at 30 billion kuna.
He also reminded of the huge costs caused to the state by the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
Pensions are not in question
He also announced that the last major redistribution of budget money will be completed today, and additional funds will be directed to the Ministry of Health, Croatian Health Insurance Institute (HZZO) for the payment of liabilities, from 400 to 500 million kuna.
Commenting on citizens' spending in December, the finance minister says some indices, according to fiscalized accounts, especially in trade, which is not closed, were at last year's level. 
The hospitality industry, on the other hand, had a drop of 80 percent according to data on account fiscalization.
He also said that next year will be financially sustainable, and that pensions are not in question.
Tramišak for RTL: Croatia has 24 billion euros for recovery! We are more prepared now than we were seven years ago
After European leaders agreed on a European Union budget in Brussels on Thursday, Croatia was given the opportunity to use about 24 billion euros for economic recovery from the corona crisis over the next 10 years.
These funds do not include those that Croatia will be able to withdraw from the previous financial framework for another three years.
Croatia has already started drafting a Recovery Plan, and it is extremely important that development projects are prepared throughout the country as soon as possible, both at the local and regional level, which could be financed in this way.
The Minister of Regional Development and European Union Funds Nataša Tramišak spoke about all this in the RTL Danas show in a conversation with Ilija Radić.
We have more than 24 billion euros at our disposal, but we must prepare for these funds, so that they come to Croatia.
When we talk about infrastructure, human resources, we are more ready now than seven years ago. 
We are currently doing very well in withdrawing funds.
There are many quality projects, both public and private. 
The local and regional community did the most. 
We have examples such as the Biokovo Nature Park, Dubrovnik Airport, the Pelješac Bridge project, the General Hospital in Virovitica, the Vučedol Dove ", says Tramišak.
She said we have the option of awarding grants and financial instruments.
Both should be combined. All entrepreneurs who have a quality project will have availability. We have prepared several public investments - in railways, in ports ...", she said.
She said that the National Development Strategy has been drafted by many public bodies, ministries, academia and the scientific community over the past two years.
No funds were invested in the documents. 
An agreement was signed with the World Bank for the strategy itself, the amount is around 32 million kuna. 
We did not pay for the development of the strategy itself. 
The meaning of the strategy is that it is an umbrella document," he said.
President Milanović submitted numerous remarks on the proposal of the State Strategy via e-consultation.
The public consultation ended yesterday. 
A lot of comments were collected, including from the Office of the President.
I would say that it is very good that the President himself saw the importance of adopting this document. 
Everything will be reviewed, what is of good quality will be to be included in the document ", said at the end the Minister of Regional Development and European Union Funds Nataša Tramišak.

Butkovic announced that port infrastructure reconstruction projects will continue in the new EU financial perspective, and Croatia is preparing for that. 
He announced that a tender for the construction of the Kozjak tunnel will be announced soon, which will contribute to resolving traffic jams in the area of ​​Trogir, Kaštela, Solin and Split.
He also said that due to the coronavirus epidemic, the revenue of Croatian roads from excise duties on fuel was reduced this year, and it will be similar next year, but this will not affect the implementation of port infrastructure projects in Split-Dalmatia County.
High-speed shipping in the city port of Split will be improved
The director of the Split Port Authority, Vice Mihanović, pointed out that the Obala kneza Domagoja, which was built 150 years ago, will now be upgraded for the first time.
That coast will be 260 meters long, and we will expand its existing width of 4 meters by 5.5 meters," said Mihanovic.
According to him, the upgraded coast will improve high-speed boat traffic in the city port of Split, and will also serve as a promenade for citizens. 
Mihanović pointed out that the upgrade of that coast is extremely important for the city port of Split, where the average annual traffic growth is about five percent.
Split's city port is the largest in Croatia, and in terms of traffic it is 22nd in the European Union," said Mihanovic, adding that in 2019, 5.6 million passengers and 850,000 vehicles passed through the city's port of Split.

Aladrović: By the end of the year, HRK 8 billion will be paid for support to employers
On Friday, Minister of Labor, Pension System, Family and Social Policy Josip Aladrović pointed out that HRK 7.6 billion had been paid from the state budget for measures to preserve jobs and part-time work, and that this amount was expected to increase by the end of the year. climb to 8 billion.
In a statement to reporters at the Ministry, Aladrović pointed out that the Government had already presented three measures to help the economy.
It is a measure of preserving jobs, which gives between 2,000 and 4,000 kuna monthly compensation for workers, whereby if the employer is closed for more than 14 days, he automatically receives 4,000 kuna per worker. 
In addition to contributions, around HRK 470 million is allocated for that. 
This measure was updated at today's session by the Management Board of the Croatian Employment Service (CES).
The second measure refers to covering part or all of the fixed costs during the closure, and this measure should amount to around HRK 250 million. 
 To qualify for this measure, entrepreneurs will need to have a revenue decline of 60 percent or more over the same period last year, ie December to December. 
The Tax Administration will prescribe the conditions for the use of this measure in a very short time.
The third measure is a new package of so-called covid loans through Hamag-Bicro in the amount of HRK 1.3 billion.
In that way, Aladrović added, all branches that the Government considers to be the most exposed to epidemiological measures until December 21, which were tightened at the end of November in order to suppress the spread of Covid-19, are included
We will monitor all epidemiological measures, evaluate their impact and accordingly, if necessary, update economic measures in order to preserve jobs and business activity of entrepreneurs," said Aladrovic.
Three different sources of funding for measures
He pointed out that in negotiations with employers' associations, they received a number of proposals, and one of them was to include in the measures those sectors and mini-activities that depend on all those who have been suspended.
We have included them in the measures, but they must prove the decline in revenues and that there is a business connection between the sectors that are closed," he explained, adding that they are covered by measures to preserve jobs.
The measure to cover fixed costs applies only to those whose work has been suspended until December 21, "he said.
According to Aladrović, there are three different sources of funding for measures to preserve jobs and part-time work, namely the state budget, the EU Sure program from which Croatia was granted a loan of slightly more than a billion euros and EU funds, or part of the program and resilience, through which about 530 million euros were obtained.
He added that, at an earlier stage, between March and May, Croatia also used funds from the European Social Fund, from which about 1.3 billion kuna was withdrawn, and another part of these funds is planned to be withdrawn to preserve employment.
The total effect on the budget, regardless of the sources of funds, is currently 7.6 billion kuna, or so much has been spent so far on these grants, and by the end of the year Alardovic expects that amount will be at the level of 8 billion kuna. 
At the same time, he roughly expects that about 60 percent of the sources of funds for these measures will be the state budget, and 40 percent EU funds.
When asked by a journalist if he was ready to be vaccinated with the vaccine against Covid-19, Aladrović answered in the affirmative. 
I am ready to get vaccinated and if it will contribute to the affirmation of vaccination and the affirmation that we will get into a situation where we will move away from the coronavirus by vaccination I am ready to do it in front of the camera,” he said.
Lončar: 30,000 requests for the use of support measures are expected in December
According to the director of the Croatian Employment Service (CES), Ante Lončar, in October the CES received about 26,000 applications for job support. 
As he said, there are about 500 of them left to be processed, because certain documentation is awaited.
He also stated that so far about HRK 240 million in support for job preservation has been paid for October, while about HRK 80 million has been paid for the measure of reducing working hours.
I try to process requests regularly and that there are no major waits in payments," Loncar said, adding that as far as new measures are concerned, they expect an additional influx of requests but believes that they will be able to resolve them in due time. 
A total of up to 30,000 applications are expected for December.
At today's session, the CES Board of Directors adopted a decision on amendments to the conditions and methods of using funds for the implementation of active employment policy measures in 2020 in the measure Support for job preservation in activities affected by coronavirus in October.
The changes apply to target groups of employers. 
Protection Headquarters (national, county, local self-government units) or are business-related as suppliers with employers who are closed by the headquarters decision, "said the CES.
Publishing activity is also added as an acceptable activity - publishing books, periodicals and other publishing activities.
It is possible to use the support for members of the management board, directors, procurators, etc., with the aim of including a larger number of employees with employers, the CES emphasizes.
All employers who have registered their activity and registered with the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute (HZMO) until September 30 can use the measure, as well as for workers employed until October 31 this year for November, and until November 30 for December, it is stated in the statement.

The Ministry of Agriculture reported on Saturday that according to the first provisional estimate by the Central Bureau of Statistics, agricultural production in 2020 increased by 4.7 percent compared to last year, from 17.9 billion to 18.8 billion kuna.
Also, an increase in net value added and productivity of almost 10 percent was recorded, the statement added.
The Minister of Agriculture, Marija Vučković, assessed that the data on the increase in net value added and productivity lead to the conclusion that the growth could be more permanent.
Final assessments need to be awaited, with those in recent years always being more positive than the first interim assessments,” she added.
Minister Vučković thanked all Croatian farmers and the agro-processing industry for their work - for their will, efforts, investments, suffering disturbances and, as she said, quiet, but very well organized work, first, second and third shifts, procurement of inputs in difficult conditions, good initiatives and criticism.
She announced that in the coming times she will encourage transformation - by focusing on the real ones, whether small or large, because in that way the Croatian village is best preserved.

Maric: 10 percent drop in line with expectations, Government stays with projection of 8 percent GDP decline in 2020
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Zdravko Maric said that the decline in Croatian GDP in the third quarter of ten percent was in line with expectations, with the decline in personal consumption slightly higher than expected and the decline in investment lower than expected, while the decline in exports of services of “only” 45 percent.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) released on Friday the first estimate that gross domestic product (GDP) fell 10 percent year-on-year in the past quarter. 
The decline is mostly due to a drop in personal consumption, but the decline is smaller compared to a record 15 percent in the previous quarter. 
It is the second quarter in a row that the economy has fallen on an annual basis, meaning it has plunged into its first recession since 2014.
Maric told reporters in front of the Ministry of Finance that the drop of ten percent had already been assumed in some way, given the surveys in which economists participated, with estimates of all more or less around the level of decline of ten percent.
Namely, the seven analysts who participated in the Hina survey expected a decline in GDP by 10.4 percent on average, and their estimates of the fall ranged from 9.5 to 11 percent.
The decline in the third quarter is also in line with the Government's expectations, said Maric, but also pointed out that the decline in personal consumption is "slightly worse" than their predictions, but at the same time a three percent drop in investment is better than expected.
Namely, according to CBS data published today, household consumption in the third quarter sank by 7.5 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, while gross fixed capital formation fell by three percent.
Present growth of construction activity
He said a 7.5 per cent drop in personal consumption was almost identical to a drop in retail in the third quarter.
The stated percentage of investment decline for Marić is "more or less good news".
Because on the one hand there is still a continuation of the growth of construction activity, and there is a segment of equipment and machinery, in which investments also fell at a lower rate than expected.
When we summarize this domestic demand, personal consumption is a little worse than we expected, and investment a little better than we expected, ”the minister said.
When looking at the export component, Maric continued, exports of goods fell in line with expectations, but what positively surprised them was that the decline in exports of services was "only" 45 percent.
Especially considering the physical indicators in terms of the decline in the number of overnight stays and tourist arrivals, Maric explained, a slightly larger decline in exports of services could be expected.
But obviously, despite all the circumstances, there was no significant additional drop in per capita consumption," Maric said.
Namely, the export of goods and services fell in the last quarter by 32.3 percent on an annual level, with the export of goods falling by three percent and the export of services 45.3 percent, the CBS reported. 
At the same time, imports of goods and services fell by 14.1 percent year-on-year. 
At the same time, imports of goods decreased by 9.9 percent and services by 33.3 percent.
Marić thus re-emphasized the problem of high import dependence.
Unfortunately, regardless of the crisis, this import" elasticity "has not improved much, on the contrary, import dependence is still high," Maric said. 
Regardless of the current challenge of the corona crisis we are facing, a significant step forward must be made in the structure of the economy, in order to reduce this dependence, he added.
Trade in November almost at the same level as in the same month last year
Looking at the overall figures for the three quarters of this year, as well as expectations for the fourth, and despite the measures of "closing" part of the economy that take effect tonight, Maric pointed out that the government still stands at the projection of eight percent decline this year.
Maric said that they did not expect, with due respect for every job, that the effect of these measures would be more significant in terms of GDP in the fourth quarter, adding that "closure" measures, which should last until December 21, are not even close. lockdown "from the second trimester.
Data for the first three quarters of 2020 show an annual GDP decline of 8.4 percent.
The journalists stated that December, considering the holidays, is the month of consumption, and asked if it is therefore not to be expected that consumption will be lower, to which Marić replied that this consumption mainly refers to retail trade, which is not closed. 
According to data on account fiscalization, he added, trade in November was almost at the same level as in the same month last year.
Everyone who can earn something in "closing" should be allowed to do so
When asked by journalists, Maric did not want to prejudge the models that will help the "closed" part of the economy, reiterating that all measures, as agreed today at a meeting with employers and catering associations, will be presented next week.
He just said that the basic postulate of the set of measures should be not to give anyone an incentive not to work, but on the contrary, to work. 
Of course, understandable, unless the circumstance is such that he is completely unable to work.
Marić cited the example of the restaurant, saying that he wanted to give them an incentive, that is, he did not want to demotivate them to stop preparing and delivering food.
We want all those who can earn something in such circumstances, not to be prevented from doing so," Maric said.
Everything envisaged in this year's budget, in terms of measures to preserve jobs, intends to pay off, said Maric, who believes that despite the new moments there will be no threat in terms of sustainability of budget financing.
We have 2.5 billion kuna to help entrepreneurs for the first four months of 2021.
Visiting Dnevnik Nova TV, the Minister of Labor, Pension System, Family and Social Policy, Josip Aladrović, spoke about the assistance measures for next year, the money provided for that, as well as other important issues.
When asked why a larger number of parafiscal levies are not abolished in order for entrepreneurs to feel concrete reliefs, the minister said that the Government was very concrete this year.
We continuously reduce non-tax benefits
This year, when we were hit by the crown crisis, all measures were planned in the context of non-tax benefits. 
So far we have relieved it by one billion and 100 million kuna.
The total number is about 4, 4 and a half billion kuna. But we must be aware that non-tax benefits have their purpose and have their earmarked funds, finance certain activities that are of an economic nature and of course there is no possibility of absolute abolition of all non-tax benefits.
We continuously reduce them, let us abolish, "says Aladrovic. why not all can be abolished.
It is a process and process that needs to be continuously reduced, the effects measured and there is no abolition of non-tax benefits and of course to make an economic balance through it. 
So, there is no possibility of abolishing all non-tax benefits now and immediately, but it must be a continuous process by which we will relieve entrepreneurs in the long run, "he says.
Currently, the measures are until 31 December regarding the limitation of working hours on the one hand, regarding the preservation of jobs on the other.
When we speak in the context of preserving jobs, we are aware that the epidemiological situation is not the most favorable and we have planned certain funds for We expect to define measures for what it will look like in the next month, at least in the first quarter. 
At the moment, we have about 2 and a half billion kuna at our disposal and we expect that for the beginning of the year, for the first quarter or the first four months.
We expect it to be harder than we did in previous projections and we will help our entrepreneurs in that way ", says Aladrović.
There is no need for a new supplementary budget because we projected it in next year's budget.
We must be aware that we have React EU at our disposal, part of EU funds, we have a state budget, and we expect to be able to finance medium- and long-term measures through the resilience program. "he says.
Asked about the help to Varaždin's caterers who closed their facilities forced by the measures and whether they will be additionally helped, the minister said that the situation was foreseen.
As for all those who are imprisoned without their will, as you say, or who are restricted from working, we have foreseen these situations in the current measures. 
So, all those who are restricted from work, who are banned from working by headquarters measures or epidemiologists, they are entitled to measures paid by the Croatian Employment Service and we have already foreseen such situations, not specifically in the area of ​​Varaždin but wherever they occur, regardless of the activity they come from. there should be bigger imbalances ", calms Aladrović.
About 5,000 more employees, the number of unemployed is stagnating
If he is afraid that we will enter the new year with many people on the job market, Aladrović says that greater turbulence was expected.
Our data shows that this did not happen. 
I am realistic, optimistic by nature. 
I like to see my optimism or realism with numbers.
We have about 5,000 more employees, the number of unemployed is stagnating, even falling compared to the peak that happened on 
Many analysts had predicted a collapse in the labor market, but it did not happen," he said.
We are a brave government, "he said.
The Labor Law is being discussed with the social partners
Absolutely nothing matters. We have continuous meetings with the social partners, with employers and trade unions, we want to harmonize as many of those critical points as possible and then let the law into the legislative procedure. 
For now we are on the right track and I expect everything to happen relatively soon. those critical points around which there are disputes to define, "says the minister.

Preserving jobs is key
Minister Marić said, presenting the Proposal of Amendments to the State Budget of the Republic of Croatia for 2020, that "this year we achieved a slightly better result than we predicted in May when the previous supplementary budget was adopted.
I will start with the rebalance for 2020. 
We have a slightly better result than our first expectations on the revenue side. 
The fall in GDP is slightly smaller than expected, by about seven billion kuna.
However, it is still about 12 "HRK 2 billion less than last year. 
What is gratifying is the situation with contributions.
They are the best indicator of the situation on the labor market, and it is crucial now to preserve jobs," Maric said in the introduction.
When we look at the expenditure side, expenditures are higher by HRK 8.6 billion compared to the initial plan, of which expenditures financed from sources that affect the result of the general government budget are higher by HRK 6.9 billion," he added.
The Ministry of Health is the most represented in this rebalance, partly due to the debt to wholesalers, but also to the costs of hospitals, and there are also investments for KBC Rijeka. 
Pensions, of course, are not and will not be questionable," the minister continued.
The Minister revealed when a formal economic recovery is expected.
This year's deficit amounts to HRK 29.5 billion, or 8 percent of GDP. 
This year, we have put the complete public finances and budget in the function of the economy, preserving jobs and overcoming extremely difficult circumstances in health care due to the epidemic. 
At our insistence, on our initiative during the presidency, a temporary suspension of fiscal rules was voted on, all so that state budgets would be a lever to economies, "he said.
We must not ignore the fact that debts in health care are seen as costs according to the European methodology. 
However, we will have expenditures for other public companies, such as Croatia Airlines.
After the fall in GDP this year, we expect growth of five percent in 2021. 
We see a full recovery of the economy at the end of 2022, but some components of the recovery will spill over to the beginning of 2023," Maric concluded.
He added that COVID measures significantly affect the result of the general government budget in 2020, while in 2021 payments of COVID measures are planned mainly from European funds.
Croatia's financial contribution to the Emergency Aid Instrument HRK 21.2 million
At today's session, the government decided on a financial contribution for the provision of emergency support within the European Union to combat the covida-19 epidemic in the amount of HRK 21.2 million, given that the current amount from the Emergency Support Instrument is insufficient.
Pursuant to the Agreement between the European Commission and the participating Member States on the procurement of covid vaccines, the EC is authorized to conclude preliminary purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturers for the procurement of pandemic vaccines at EU level.
The costs of previous purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturers are financed by the Emergency Aid Instrument, however the EC has informed Member States that this money is not sufficient to finance all the previous agreements envisaged.
Therefore, EU Member States have been requested to replenish the total amount of EUR 750 million, in order to enable the conclusion of two additional preliminary agreements with vaccine manufacturers with which the EC negotiating team is negotiating.
An assessment of the budgetary implications of each individual EU Member State was made in accordance with the share of gross national income in the total gross national income of the EU. 
According to the above criteria, the amount of contributions for Croatia is 0.4 gross national income, ie 2,810,177 euros, which is 21,260,301 kunas, reported the Minister of Health Vili Beroš.
The amount is provided within the state budget for this year in the section of the Ministry of Health.
Three final bills were sent to the Parliament
The Government sent the final proposal for amendments to the Identity Card Act to the Parliament, and the novelty in the law is that the identity cards on the new electronic data carrier will contain biometric identifiers of the identity card holder, ie a face and two fingerprints in digital formats.
The visual appearance of the identity card is also changing, and the conditions for the implementation of the EU Regulation on strengthening the security of identity cards of Union citizens and residence documents issued to Union citizens and their families are provided, he pointed out.
Pursuant to the Regulation, the age limit for issuing identity cards that can be issued with a longer validity period has been raised from 65 to 70 years of age, and the obligation to withdraw from the use of identity cards without a validity period that does not meet minimum security standards is prescribed.
It will also be possible for either parent, as the child's legal representative, to submit a request and take over their child's identity card, and prescribe the obligation to obtain an identity card for a person who has reached 16 years of age and who has been allowed to marry and reside in Croatia. 
Technical prerequisites are also being created for the use of electronic ID card functionalities on other devices (mobile phones and tablets), and not only on computers.
The final bill on the proclamation of the Dinara Nature Park was sent to the Parliament, which would declare the area of ​​the Croatian part of the Dinara, Troglav and Kamešnica mountains, the source and upper course of the Cetina River and karst fields along the Cetina (Croatian, Paško and Vrličko) and covers the area of ​​Šibenik-Knin and Split-Dalmatia counties, on an area of ​​62.9 hectares.
This would ensure the preservation of the original natural values ​​of the area, rich geodiversity, wild flora and fauna, endemics and the overall diversity of natural habitats, while allowing certain economic and other activities and interventions, to the extent that will not jeopardize the essential features and role of space. 
In the area of ​​the future "Dinara" Nature Park, there are 11 areas of the ecological network (2 areas for birds and 9 for species and habitats), so that about 90 percent of the area of ​​the nature park will also be the area of ​​the Natura 2000 ecological network.
 The final draft law on the implementation of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on the promotion of fairness and transparency for business users of Internet mediation services was also sent to the Parliament.
The Regulation applies to Internet mediation services and Internet search engines, the provision of which is offered to business and corporate users of Internet sites who offer goods or services to consumers through these services (Internet intermediation and Internet search engines).
The law regulates the competent body and tasks, inspection supervision and misdemeanor provisions for acting contrary to the proposed law.

The decree on the amount of the minimum wage stipulates that the minimum net wage from 1 January will amount to HRK 3,400.
This is HRK 150 more than in 2020, and since the beginning of the mandate in 2016, the minimum wage has been increased by HRK 1,130 in gross and HRK 904 in net amount.
The minimum salary for 2020 in the net amount was HRK 3,250, in the gross amount of HRK 4,062.51, at the time of proposing its amount it was 46.49 percent of the average gross salary in legal entities in the Republic of Croatia from January to July 2019. year, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.
The Dinara Nature Park will be managed by a public institution established by a decree of the Government of the Republic of Croatia.
As there have been changes in the calculation and growth of gross wages, it currently amounts to 44.25 percent of the average gross wage compared to the period in the first seven months of this year, and the Expert Committee for Monitoring and Analysis of the Minimum Wage proposed that the minimum gross wage for 2021 is determined in the range from the current amount of the gross minimum wage to HRK 4,407.82.

The Prime Minister Andrej Plenković met today in Ivanić-Grad with the Mayor of the City of Ivanić-Grad, Javor Bojan Leša, and the County Prefect of Zagreb, Stjepan Kožić, with whom he discussed activities in Ivanić-Grad and Zagreb County.
In a statement for the media, Prime Minister Plenković pointed out that a number of concrete achievements had been made in Zagreb County in the past year of the pandemic, in which both entrepreneurs and farmers were supported.
In doing so, he added, they acted complementary to what the government has done to preserve jobs.
Zagreb County is among the five most developed in Croatia
In Zagreb County, these are funds that have touched as many as 57,000 workers, and so far 512 million kuna has been paid to preserve jobs. 
In the mandate of our Government in this county, 514 million euros of European funds have been contracted for projects contributing to Zagreb County development." , he said.
At the same time, with the reform of the Law on Financing of Local and Regional Self-Government, this County received 28 percent more revenue in 2020 compared to 2017, added Prime Minister Plenković.
He pointed out that Zagreb County is among the five most developed counties in Croatia, and assessed the example of Ivanić-Grad, which invests in education and educational and sports programs, as very good.
Before the meeting with the prefect and the mayor, Prime Minister Plenković visited the new laying hen farm Lukač in the settlement of Derežani near Ivanić-Grad.
The investment worth 60 million kuna will significantly increase the production capacity of the company with 80 employees and is a great example of entrepreneurship which, with the application of the most modern technology, contributes to the development of agriculture," said Prime Minister Plenković.
He added that the company is at the top of egg production in Croatia, which is developing cooperation with key retail chains and hotels and thus contributes to Croatian agriculture and production.
When electing the president of the Supreme Court, there is respect for the procedure, everything else is politicization
Answering journalists' questions on other current topics, Prime Minister Plenković also commented on the election of the President of the Supreme Court.
He asserted that there were no setbacks in that case.
There is respect for the Constitution, the Law in force, and all this else is politicization for no reason, a desire for some topic that in fact seems incredible. 
You have the Constitution, the Law, the prescribed procedure and the public invitation that was announced, "it was pointed out.
He added that the SDP had strongly criticized the previous procedure, and praised the new one when the law was passed.
Now all of a sudden we are singing another song. 
There are no pitfalls
The Constitution, the Law and the institute of public call and point should be respected," said Prime Minister Plenković.
There is no rational argument to prevent someone who wants to be president of the Supreme Court from responding to a public call
He added that this situation should not have happened at all, but also stressed that it did not happen thanks to the parliamentary majority and the DSV, but to someone else.
We just need to respect the regulations that are in force, "he stressed, recalling yesterday's statement by the Speaker of Parliament, who explained that according to the rules of procedure, such a proposal by the President of the Republic, which is not according to procedure, cannot be on the agenda.
Regarding the invitation of the President of the Republic to the meeting, Prime Minister Plenković pointed out that he could no longer communicate about it through the media.
I don't want to be able to communicate through the media who will call whom. 
He said he would call, so he didn't call, so he sends a message through our colleague and partner in the parliamentary majority of Prefect Čačić.
All in all, realistically speaking, it's bizarre." said the Prime Minister.
Answering the question of journalists what he thinks about the candidate proposed by the President of the Republic for the President of the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Plenković said that this is not a topic at all at the moment.
This candidacy is in accordance with the laws in force in the Republic of Croatia, and the Constitutional Court is the one that decides whether something is in accordance with the Constitution or not and has not said anything about it, so we have nothing to talk about," said Prime Minister Plenković. adding that it is not a question of whether someone respects the candidate proposed by the President of the Republic.
He pointed out that there was no crisis and that the election deadline was July and that the situation was now being generated unnecessarily, adding that he did not see any rational argument that could have prevented Professor Đurđević from responding to the DSV's public call.
I don't see a counter-argument about what is wrong with the procedure that Orsat Miljenić praised in the parliamentary debate. 
What is the problem, why this topic at all
That should be asked, not us but someone else. 
So, this is a topic in which we do not we generate a problem, nor do we insist on any conflict, nor do we consider this necessary or useful, nothing, ”the Prime Minister said.
Croatia is in favor of a common solution in the EU that will enable free movement with the safety of people
As for the discussion of possible so-called With Covid passports at the level of the European Union, Prime Minister Plenković said that this was being discussed.
There are three categories of people - those who have survived, those who have been vaccinated and those who have been tested.
I am in Brussels on Thursday and Friday and that will be one of the topics, and that is one of the topics at the forthcoming European Council in late March. 
We need to find a mechanism that is acceptable to all and that gives us a kind of guarantee, ”he said.
He added that Croatia is in favor of a joint solution that will enable freedom of movement in a way that people are safe.
He emphasized that at the moment it is only a matter of the idea of ​​the European Commission and the principled direction that the European Council will give it, and then the procedure will take several months.
For the private sector from the NPO a serious amount of money
He also referred to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.
He reminded that Croatia has a total of 24.2 billion euros at its disposal, for which the Government fought.
Immediately after the formation of the Government in the second term, from August, working groups were established to work on the preparation of the National Recovery and Resilience Program.
He also reminded that the Government sent a draft to the European Commission at the end of December, which must be of a reform nature and must have an investment part and projects.
He explained that Croatia has at its disposal 6 billion euros from the next generation EU Instrument, through the National Recovery and Resilience Program, which are completely non-refundable.
The second part that the Government is working on in parallel relates to the concept of using funds from the new Multiannual Financial Framework, where we have over 12.5 billion euros at our disposal.
The third option comes again from the next-generation EU Instrument, and relates to 3.5 billion euros in loans.
Within the first 6 billion from the next generation EU Instrument, he added, more than 30 percent of the funds go to the private sector.
It’s a serious amount of money being made to help the private sector, just as we’ve done everything we’ve done in the covid crisis for the private sector,” he said.
We have made it possible to finance absolutely everything while maintaining the credit rating
He reminded that during the entire crisis, the Government gave money directly to employers for workers' salaries, for which more than 9 billion kuna has been provided so far.
Furthermore, special measures are being taken for loans and liquidity funds on the most favorable possible terms.
Also, the state forgives a huge portion of benefits that would otherwise go to employers.
All these are activities that helped the private sector," he stressed and reminded that on the eve of last year's parliamentary elections, the SDP had a thesis about 400,000 unemployed, which, thanks to government measures, did not happen.
We practically have employment-unemployment within the framework we had before Covid, and at the same time we have made it possible to finance absolutely everything - from enormous healthcare costs, masks, protective equipment, to helping the economy, while maintaining an investment credit rating and a clear path to the eurozone 
A decade of recovery with the global trend of the fourth industrial revolution, digital and green transition
He also reminded that two weeks ago Croatia issued a bond of 2 billion euros on the international market, earning 460 million kuna a year on interest alone, given that one ten-year-old bond was issued.
We have maintained a reputation in the financial markets, kept jobs and enabled people to overcome the crisis as unprecedentedly as possible in this situation
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković visited the new laying hen farm of the Lukač family company, in which 60 million kuna was invested, which increased its capacity to 255,000 laying hens.

A great new investment worth a total of 60 million kuna and which will increase capacity to 255 thousand laying hens.
The company employs 80 people and is a great example of entrepreneurship, an engagement that is at the top of egg production in Croatia, developing cooperation with key trade chains, hotels and thus contributes to Croatian agriculture, production and development of the most modern technologies, in accordance with all standards applied in EU countries, "said Prime Minister Plenković.
The owner of the company, Marijan Lukač, pointed out that the new laying hen plant has a capacity of 165 thousand laying hens, which will annually produce about 50 million eggs, which will contribute to the reduction of imports.
In total, there are 250,000 laying hens on the entire Lukač farm, at two locations, and the annual egg production reaches 75 million.
It is the second largest Croatian egg producer.
Lukac expressed hope that he would continue with further investments, saying that he already has new projects in the pipeline.
Minister of Agriculture Marija Vučković said that this was a family vision that had been developing since 1992, to which her ministry and the Government were trying, at least modestly, to contribute with their measures.
She thanked the Prime Minister and the Government for the strategic importance they attach to agriculture, so that in 2020, agricultural growth was achieved despite difficult circumstances.
This is not the only and the first growth, agriculture has been growing continuously for three years, which is partly the result of circumstances, but largely of investment measures from the Rural Development Program that bring about the structural transformation of the Croatian countryside, "said Vuckovic.
So far, more than 65 per cent of the funds have been disbursed from the program, the minister said.
In the Zagreb County, as she stated, so far, projects worth almost HRK 750 million have been contracted from the Rural Development Program, and with direct grants, the total contracted funds in this programming period exceed HRK 1.8 billion.
When asked by journalists to comment on the statement of the owner of the farm that he had been waiting for six years for the administration to settle over the investment, the Prime Minister answered "of course it is too long".
The whole process, whether administrative or judicial, needs to be speeded up, made more efficient, purposeful and it is not good that the obstacles, and as far as I understand were not related to agriculture but more to the construction aspect, are too long and efforts should be made to deal with them. and they make decisions faster, ”the prime minister said.
Prime Minister Plenković said today that the private sector can count on at least 30 percent of the non-refundable six billion euros from the "Next Generation EU" Instrument, and there is also participation in other directions of the inflow of European money.

These injections that will come through the National Recovery and Resilience Program, through the next generation EU, through the Multiannual Financial Framework, throughout the decade following the Government Program, the National Development Strategy, the National Reform Program, the Eurozone Action Plan, and special recommendations we have from the European Commission for reforms, give a chance for this decade to be a decade of recovery and, in addition, to follow the global trend of the fourth industrial revolution and the digital and green transition, "concluded the Prime Minister.
Tramišak pointed out that 41 contracts were handed over for projects from the investment program in small communal, social, educational, health and other infrastructure in the area of ​​municipalities and cities in that county.
This year, in addition to investing in assisted areas, where we have the most applications from local governments, we opened a call for those areas that are slightly above the average development, where we will also divide the contracts," said Tramišak.
She added that the goal of the program is to improve the quality of life in municipalities and cities through small infrastructure projects, such as roads, public lighting, kindergartens and investments in primary schools and health centers, to make public services more accessible and quality of life.
Projects important for improving the quality of life in the county
When asked by journalists about the European projects contracted so far, Tramišak answered that projects worth more than 5.5 billion kuna have been contracted in the Osijek-Baranja County so far, including investments in the development of family farms, entrepreneurial projects and public projects implemented by counties, local governments and associations.
Prefect Ivan Anušić said that the county had applied for two projects as part of that program - the renovation and modernization of a home for the elderly in Beli Manastir and the construction of a school sports hall in Ivanovac.
He said that such programs, as well as funds from the European Union and national funds, are used to implement projects important for improving the quality of life in the county, thanks to the excellent cooperation between local authorities, the relevant ministry and the Government of the Republic of Croatia. of Rural Development for projects in Osijek-Baranja County, worth a total of more than 41 million kuna, was handed over to users on Monday by Minister of Agriculture Marija Vučković.
Grants were awarded for projects of meat processing, fattening cattle and the use of renewable energy sources, which are worth a total of more than 77 million kuna.
Minister Vučković pointed out that in the area of ​​that county in this programming period, within the Rural Development Program, projects worth more than 2 billion kuna were contracted, of which 1.6 billion kuna has been paid so far.
When funds from the European Guarantee Fund, which is used for direct payments and joint market organization, are added to that, a total of more than HRK 6 billion has been contracted in the county in the past six years, of which more than HRK 5.7 billion has been disbursed so far. kuna, the minister added.
When asked by journalists about the action plan for the construction of cold stores, Vučković said that the program is being upgraded with market analysis, so that future Croatian warehousing and distribution areas would be eligible for funding from EU funds, and only partly from national funds.
Speaking about the project of building a Regional Distribution Center for Fruits and Vegetables in Osijek, the Minister said that it was a project included in the annex to the Development Agreement for Slavonia, Baranja and Srijem and that the Ministry would financially support its construction with state budget money. 
We will soon come out with a concrete amount, because in the coming weeks we have to see what we will finance from EU funds and what from the state budget," she explained.
She assessed that the Rural Development Program is the most important for domestic farmers, because the investments brought by this program, investment opportunities in new technologies and innovations, are what will transform the Croatian rural area.
We have contracted about 88 percent of the planned funds so far, of which more than 63 percent has been paid so far, which makes it one of the best programs, so I have no doubt in its success," said Minister Vuckovic.
Prefect Ivan Anušić reported that the construction of the Regional Distribution Center for Fruits and Vegetables, irrigation systems, dairy and agricultural land was discussed at the meeting with Minister Vučković, and that the Ministry fully understood all issues.
After the award of the grant agreement, Minister Vučković visited the Ravlić Meat Industry and local agricultural farms.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) released on Friday the first estimate that GDP fell 8.4 percent year-on-year last year. 
It is a record decline, affected by the covida-19 pandemic and measures to close part of the economy to prevent the spread of the infection.
In the last quarter of last year, however, GDP fell by seven percent year on year, down from previous quarters. 
In the second quarter, GDP fell by 15.4 percent, the most since 1995, when the CBS kept the data, and in the third quarter by 10 percent.
Looking retrospectively, since the beginning of the corona crisis, the projections of the Government and the Ministry of Finance have proven to be consistent and consistent, and almost the most accurate, Maric told reporters in front of the Ministry of Finance.
The last projection of the fall for 2020, announced by the Government, was eight percent, but from then until the end of the year, certain segments of the economy were "closed", such as catering, recreational sports and games of chance, the Minister of Finance reminded.
It had a certain repercussion, so the rate of decline of 8.4 percent is completely in line with our expectations," he said.
The tourist season was at 50 percent of a record 2019
Maric reminded that in 2020, a month and a half in force was practically a complete "closure" of the economy, while the tourist season was at 50 percent of the record 2019.
That is better than the initial assumptions, when a 70 percent drop in overnight stays was expected, Maric said, noting that Croatia, when looking at the EU's Mediterranean members, had the best tourist season.
He pointed out that the data for the last quarter of 2020 alone, a drop of seven percent on an annual level, largely meet expectations.
In terms of components, investments in the fourth quarter yielded a slightly better result than expected, given that their decline was expected again, said Marić.
Namely, according to the CBS data published today, gross fixed capital formation increased by 4.2 percent year on year in the past quarter, which is their first growth after two quarters of decline.
On the other hand, some other components were expected to perform slightly better, but when you add it all up, everything is in line with expectations and what we said, said Marić.
According to the CBS, household consumption fell by 4.5 percent in the previous quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, a smaller decline than in the previous quarter.
Exports of goods and services, on the other hand, fell by 9.8 percent year on year, much slower than in the previous quarter. 
At the same time, exports of goods rose by 8.6 percent, while exports of services sank by 35 percent.
We stick to an estimate of GDP growth in 2021 of about five percent
Marić stated that the Government still stands by its estimates of GDP growth in 2021 of around five percent, which means that a complete recovery of the Croatian economy cannot be expected this year, in terms of reaching the pre-crisis level.
That “V” recovery under the baseline scenario is possible at the earliest at the end of 2022, while the recovery of individual activities is likely to spill over into 2023, he said.
He stated that the executive power, but also businessmen and individuals, must find a way to reach pre-crisis levels of GDP as soon as possible, so as not to repeat the circumstances from the last time, when It took Croatia 11 years to reach the level of GDP from the pre-crisis 2008.
The first income tax refund payments during May
Regarding the refund of overpaid income tax, it is estimated that it could total almost two billion kuna last year, said Maric.
Last year, the tax refund was paid in June, and the Minister of Finance announced that the first tax refund payments this year will start in May.
Based on the tax changes from the fourth round of tax reform that came into force at the beginning of last year, the reduction of income tax liability by one hundred percent for young people up to 25 years of age and by 50 percent for those from 26 to 30 years of age is regulated. so the tax refund for 2020 will be significantly higher than for the year before.
When looking at the analyzes of some sociologists and psychologists, said Marić, this crisis is especially reflected in the condition of young people, so these tax changes can be seen as an additional incentive to this population.
Annual tax return applications can be submitted until Monday, March 1, for those citizens who are in the regular procedure and who are obliged to submit the annual income tax return themselves, while for the vast majority of citizens there is a special procedure for determining the annual income tax. which is performed by the Tax Administration ex officio.
Entrepreneurs will be paid HRK 103 million in December as compensation for fixed costs
When it comes to the measure of reimbursement of fixed costs, and to the statement of journalists that entrepreneurs complain that their payments are late, Maric reported that out of 9973 requests received by the Tax Administration for last December, a total of 9226 or 93 percent were accepted, worth 103 million. 
Another 48 requests are being processed, while the remaining part refers to requests that did not meet the conditions or there were "duplicates" in the application, said Marić.
So far, 3,627 applications have been submitted for January, of which 78 percent or 2,813 have already been accepted, worth around HRK 29 million.
The measure to preserve jobs will continue in March, which will cost the state from 300 to 400 million kuna, and the measure of compensation of fixed costs will continue, it was said on Friday after the meeting of representatives of the Government of the Republic of Croatia with employers.
Minister of Labor, Pension System, Family and Social Policy Josip Aladrovic believes that the continuation of measures to preserve jobs will lead to the fact that there will be no mass layoffs.
He also pointed out that his data show that there have been no mass layoffs so far.
In addition to the measure for preserving jobs, which is quite similar to the conditions that were for January and February, Aladrović said that the compensation of fixed costs continues.
Annual tax return applications can be submitted until Monday, March 1, for those citizens who are in the regular procedure and who are obliged to submit the annual income tax return themselves, while for the vast majority of citizens a special procedure for determining the annual income tax is carried out. which is performed by the Tax Administration ex officio.
Entrepreneurs will be paid HRK 103 million in December as compensation for fixed costs
When it comes to the measure of reimbursement of fixed costs, and to the statement of journalists that entrepreneurs complain that their payments are late, Marić reported that out of 9973 requests received by the Tax Administration for last December, a total of 9226 or 93 percent were accepted, worth 103 million. 
Another 48 requests are being processed, while the remaining part refers to requests that did not meet the conditions or there were "duplicates" in the application, said Marić.
So far, 3,627 applications have been submitted for January, of which 78 percent or 2,813 have already been accepted, worth around HRK 29 million.
He believes that this combination of measures will help both employers and workers, preserve the labor market and preserve the wage bill.
It will have to prove a 40 percent or 60 percent drop in revenue
Asked whether the measures could be used by the owners of catering facilities that open terraces, he answered that the possibility of restricting work was left, while so far, in January and February, the situation was that the facilities were closed.
With this closure, the preconditions were met for someone to be a beneficiary of the measures.
Now, given the limited work, it will be necessary to prove a drop in revenue of 40 or 60 percent to more, with a support scheme (to preserve jobs) from 2,000 to 4,000 kuna, an identical measure as in the past 12 months ", said Aladrović, adding that the measure of compensation of fixed costs will also be treated as before.
He also pointed out that the comparison of the drop in traffic, in order to realize the right to use the measures, will be done with the year before last. 
According to Aladrović, this is another concession to entrepreneurs, to whom his ministry is always at his service.
It is estimated that measures to preserve jobs in March will cost the state 300 to 400 million kuna, with Aladrovic believing that this will still be the higher amount mentioned.
45,000 requests for the use of measures for January
By the way, there are about 45,000 requests for the use of measures in January, and the Croatian Employment Service (CES) has processed about 80 percent of requests.
Aladrovic sees the current epidemiological situation and the partial relaxation of measures as a good path, as a phase of optimism.
He also believes that very soon there will be no need for government measures to preserve jobs.
The Tax Administration will publish instructions for covering fixed costs for February
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Zdravko Marić stated that the Civil Protection Headquarters today clarified all the measures announced by Prime Minister Andrej Plenković the day before.
More or less we know everything that will take effect on March 1. The implementation of key measures will continue, and that is the preservation of jobs and covering part or all of the fixed costs," he told reporters before the Ministry of Finance.
He announced that the Tax Administration will publish instructions today to cover fixed costs for February, which will be identical to January, despite the fact that the liberalization regime for some activities started in mid-February.
We must monitor the situation from day to day, and adjust our measures accordingly. 
Along with human health and lives, along with epidemiological measures, the preservation of jobs will remain a key priority," the minister said.
Responding to a journalist's question about the sustainability of the budget, Maric said that the revenue side has no big positive or negative surprises regarding the filling of the budget, while on the expenditure side "there are a handful of challenges".
However, he said that in order to preserve jobs and cover part of the fixed costs, "we must and will find that money".
The Minister of Agriculture, Marija Vučković, said in Petrinja that the tenders intended for the reconstruction and revitalization of agricultural holdings in the earthquake-affected areas would be announced in March.
Today, Vučković was in Sisak-Moslavina County and visited farms there.
The tender for measure 5 (Restoration of agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and catastrophic events and introduction of appropriate preventive activities) with simplified procedures is in the process of harmonization with the European Commission and is ready in principle, said Vuckovic.
We have prepared an allocation set aside for it, approximately 120 million kuna. 
The tender will be intended for the restoration of production potential on collapsed farms and farm buildings, for lost livestock and crops that suffer damage," she said.
In addition to measure 5, as she stated, the Ministry works and proposes measures within the working group for revitalization led by the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds and the Ministry of Economy.
Thus, the basic reconstruction measure will be complemented by projects and programs that can adequately support agricultural production and the wood processing industry in the quake-hit area.
Further investments in original and protected breeds will also be encouraged, said Vučković, noting that today she was on two farms that breed the original Banija pig "šara".
This breed will be supported by additional grants, said Vučković, reminding that a draft program for sensitive sectors has already been published, in which the possibility of applying for that breed in the program has been added.
Irrigation project Velika Ludina worth 85 million kuna
The Minister also pointed out the Velika Ludina irrigation project, which will be used to irrigate about 450 hectares, for which the preparation of project-technical documentation is nearing completion. The project is worth an estimated 85m kuna, she said.
She explained that the project is not only viewed through public irrigation infrastructure, but will also create special support for the purchase of equipment for producers and fruit growers, as well as support for joining the production organization of users of the future irrigation system. 
The possibility of financing associated producers of processing facilities and warehousing and distribution centers will also be opened.
When asked by a journalist what are the recommendations for farmers whose land is endangered by landslides, and sowing is just around the corner, Vuckovic said that about 15 locations with problems due to sinkholes have been reported, and farmers have received recommendations to contact professional services. 
She also announced special smaller value programs to help them.
At the end of 2015, general government public debt reached the level of HRK 289.6 billion or 86.7% of gross domestic product (hereinafter: GDP). 
This high level of public debt represents a major burden on overall economic policy and, with its associated risks, exacerbates the vulnerability of public finances.
Cyclical disturbances accompanied by structural rigidities in the period 2008-2015 demonstrated the consequent scale and speed of expansion of public debt, which increased by HRK 152 billion in that period, or measured as a share of GDP from 39.6% to 86.7% . 
The exit from the multi-year economic recession in 2015 supported the efforts and effects of the implemented fiscal consolidation and consequently stopped the multi-year trend of excessive year-on-year growth rates of the share of public debt in GDP.
Existing macroeconomic projections in the short term suggest mitigating refinancing risk and reversing this trend.
However, the achieved level of public debt requires a comprehensive economic policy approach at three basic levels.
In the narrowest sense, public debt management implies defining how to meet the state budget's financing needs and designing the debt structure by choosing markets, instruments and debt dates.
In a broader sense, debt management is an integral part of fiscal policy and refers to decisions about which part of government expenditures will be financed through debt and what the target level of debt is. 
Such decisions are explained in more detail in annual strategic documents such as guidelines for the preparation of the state budget, the state budget itself and the convergence program that is being developed within the European Semester. 
The design and implementation of the Public Debt Management Strategy, both in a narrower and broader sense, requires coordinated and consistent action of economic policy measures based on three key strategic priorities
Stimulating economic growth, further fiscal consolidation and activation of state assets.
Such measures will be accompanied by an active public debt management policy with the aim of ensuring its long-term sustainability and limiting the negative effects of associated risks.
In this context, the Public Debt Management Strategy for the period 2017-2019 (hereinafter: the Strategy) defines the basic objectives and implementation methods for improving the sustainability of total public debt and mitigating the associated risks.
 In addition to the analysis of the stated risks of public debt management, the Strategy also contains a borrowing plan in 2017 with the planned dynamics and calendar of auctions and projections of the . In addition to the analysis of the stated risks of public debt management, the Strategy also contains a borrowing plan in 2017 with the planned dynamics and calendar of auctions and projections of the borrowing plan until 2019. 
A necessary lever for active public debt management is the regular identification, publication and evaluation of the implementation of the Public Debt Management Strategy, the objectives of which are based on a cost-risk analysis, taking into account macroeconomic and market constraints.
Therefore, in the forthcoming period, regular annual adoption and publication of a strategy for a three-year period in line with the current convergence program and three-year fiscal projections is envisaged.
The Budget Law1 prescribes the basic goal of borrowing and debt management, and it is aimed at ensuring the financial needs of the state budget by achieving the lowest medium- and long-term cost of financing while assuming a prudent level of risk
Prudent risk management is necessary in order to contribute to the achievement of established fiscal projections, ensure sustainability and optimal debt structure, and achieve the goals set by the debt management strategy. 
Borrowing is carried out for the purpose of financing the budget deficit, investment projects and special programs (as approved by the Croatian Parliament), repayment of state debt, settlement of overdue payments related to state guarantees, budget liquidity management and to cover the needs of the Croatian National Bank (hereinafter: CNB) for international reserves. 
The role of the representative body in debt management varies from country to country, from delegating total borrowing authority to the government / ministry of finance without subsequent reporting obligations, to the representative body approving each borrowing transaction.
The best practice of the European Union (hereinafter: the EU) is present in cases where the right to borrow is delegated to the government / ministry of finance, but at the same time defines the objectives of debt management with annual reporting on borrowing and debt management. 
In line with the set goals, the government / ministry of finance is the one that decides on the strategy, based on the consideration of expected costs and risks. 
The Croatian Parliament, through the law on the execution of the state budget, which is adopted every year with the state budget, determines the total amount of new state debt and state guarantees that can be taken over or issued during the budget year.
The Croatian Parliament is reported twice a year, through semi-annual and annual reports on the execution of the state budget, on borrowing on the domestic and foreign money and capital markets, and on given state guarantees and expenditures on state guarantees.
The Budget Law prescribes restrictions on short-term and long-term borrowing for local and regional self-government units, and the Law on Execution of the State Budget regulates the powers of the Government when making a decision on giving consent for long-term borrowing of local and regional self-government units. 
A unit of local and regional self-government may, in the long run, be indebted only for an investment financed from its budget, which is confirmed by its representative body, with the prior consent of the Government, at the proposal of the Minister of Finance. 
One of the conditions is that the total annual liability of a unit of local and regional self-government that borrows by taking loans, borrowings and issuing securities may amount to a maximum of 20% 1 Official Gazette, no. 87/08, 136/12 and 15/15 6 realized revenues in the year preceding the year in which it borrows, less revenues and receipts from domestic and foreign aid and donations as well as from special contracts
Co-financing of citizens for local self-government, realized on the basis of additional share in income tax and equalization assistance to finance decentralized functions.
In the manner shown, the borrowing of local and regional self-government units is retained within the given fiscal framework. 
Furthermore, the Budget Act stipulates that a legal entity in majority ownership or co-ownership of the Republic of Croatia enters into credit or loan agreements or provides guarantees based on a decision of the Government's consent in case the value of the deal or guarantee exceeds the amount in 2017 determined in the amount of HRK 7.5 million.
After the first part of this chapter describes the appropriate institutional and legal framework, and in order to better understand the basic strategic elements of public debt management policy, which will be presented below, it is necessary to define key terms in this context.
Public debt represents the gross nominal value of general government debt, according to EU statistical reporting rules.
Debt refers to units classified according to the official sector classification in the general government sector, and consists of liabilities under the following financial instruments: cash and deposits, debt securities, and loans and borrowings.
Pursuant to the Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of National General Government Statistics and Related Statistics, the CNB is responsible for annual and quarterly general government financial account statistics and quarterly debt reporting according to the Maastricht criteria according to the ESA 2010 methodology. 
The general government sector consists of three sub-sectors: central government, local government and social security funds.
The central government includes state administrative organizations, state agencies and other government institutions that have jurisdiction over the entire economic territory and are separate from social security funds. 
The central government also includes non-profit institutions that are controlled and mostly funded by the central government. 
The central government includes users of the state budget, extra-budgetary users (Croatian Waters - HV, Fund for Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency - EPEEF, Croatian Roads - HC, State Agency for Deposit Insurance and Bank Rehabilitation - DAB, Croatian Privatization Fund - CPF up to 31 March 2011
Central Bureau of Statistics 7 The local government includes local and regional self-government units and users of local budgets. 
It also includes non-profit institutions that are controlled by and largely funded by the local government.
The subsector of social security funds includes all institutional units whose primary activity is the administration of the social security system (Croatian Health Insurance Institute, Croatian Pension Insurance Institute and Croatian Employment Service).
Government debt in this document is a part of public debt that is settled directly from the state budget, and consists of liabilities under the following instruments: bonds, treasury bills, loans and borrowings.
In the period 2008-2015, public debt increased from 39.6% of GDP to 86.7% of GDP, ie from HRK 137.6 billion to HRK 289.6 billion.
Such debt growth since 2008 has been influenced by the accumulation of budget deficits, but also by factors that mainly relate to the realization of potential risks in state-owned enterprises. 
In addition, the level of public debt was significantly affected by the reclassification of several highly indebted state-owned enterprises into the general government sector, due to the transition to ESA 2010. 
So far, the greatest impact on public debt has had the following three entities: HAC, ARZ and HBOR. 
The debt of these entities at the end of 2015 amounted to HRK 45.2 billion.
Furthermore, by applying the new methodology and the debt of Bina Istra d.d. it was reclassified as public debt and thus increased by an additional 1.4% of GDP.
Observed by levels of government, the majority of public debt relates to the central government sector in the amount of HRK 284.2 billion, the debt of the local government sector amounts to HRK 5.4 billion, and a negligible part of the debt of HRK 1.9 million relates to the funds sector social security.
It is important to emphasize again that the debt of the central government sector, in addition to the debt of state budget users, includes the debt of extrabudgetary users in the amount of HRK 12.2 billion, as well as the debt of state-owned entities (HŽI, HRT, HAC , ARZ and HBOR), public-private partnerships and concessions in the total amount of HRK 54.3 billion. 
Looking at borrowing instruments, the largest part of public debt arose from borrowing through long-term securities, ie bonds (56.1%), followed by borrowing through loans (37.4%) and short-term securities (6.5%). 
The currency structure of public debt shows that a significant part of the debt is denominated in foreign currency, with debt denominated in euros accounting for 74.4%, debt denominated in kuna 21.4%, and debt denominated in dollars 4.1% of total debt .
A small part of the debt (0.1%) is denominated in Swiss francs.
Debt denominated in euros has been gradually increasing in recent years and is largely the result of the issuance of domestic and foreign bonds denominated in euros, borrowing on the domestic market through syndicated loans and the use of project loans from international financial institutions.
The structure of public debt by maturity shows that at the end of 2015, the share of public debt with a maturity of up to one year in total debt amounted to 6.7%. 
The share of public debt with a maturity of one to five years was 16.4%, while the share of debt with a maturity of five to 10 years was 37.3%. Debt with a maturity of over 10 years accounts for 39.6% of total public debt.
At the end of 2015, the total issued guarantees of the Republic of Croatia (hereinafter: the Republic of Croatia) amounted to HRK 7.3 billion, ie 2.2% of GDP, and compared to the end of 2014, they decreased by HRK 1 billion. 
This amount of total guarantees is primarily the result of the aforementioned harmonization with the ESA 2010 methodology and the assumption of liabilities of public companies in public debt. 
At the end of September 2016, total guarantees issued by the Republic of Croatia amounted to HRK 8.1 billion or 2.4% of GDP.
Borrowing through Eurobond bonds on the international market In March 2015, the Republic of Croatia borrowed on the international financial market by issuing ten-year Eurobonds in the amount of EUR 1.5 billion. 
The bonds were issued at a price of 97.845% of the nominal amount.
The interest coupon is fixed and amounts to 3.0% per annum, with a yield to maturity of 3.256%. 
The maturity date of the bonds is March 11, 2025, and interest on the bonds is paid once a year starting from March 11, 2016. 
Bonds with placement on the domestic capital market In 2015, the Republic of Croatia borrowed in July and December through the issuance of domestic bonds. 
In July, it borrowed by issuing bonds with placement on the domestic capital market in the amount of HRK 6 billion. 
The bonds were issued at a price of 98.497% of the nominal amount. 
The maturity of the bonds is July 9, 2025, the interest coupon is fixed and amounts to 4.5% per annum and is paid semi-annually. 
In December 2015, bonds in the amount of HRK 6 billion were issued on the domestic capital market.
The bonds were issued at a price of 98.703% of the nominal amount. 
The maturity of the bonds is December 14, 2026. 
The interest coupon is fixed and amounts to 4.25% per annum.
Interest on bonds is paid semi-annually, and the principal will be paid in full at maturity. 
This bond issue was supplemented in March 2016 with an amount of HRK 4 billion at a price of 102.248% of the nominal amount. 
The bonds are consolidated with the issue of bonds from December and form an integral issue in the amount of HRK 10 billion maturing on December 14, 2026. 
In order to execute the expenditures determined by the Act on the Execution of the State Budget of the Republic of Croatia for 20162, the Republic of Croatia borrowed in July 2016 by issuing bonds with placement on the domestic capital market in the amount of HRK 6 billion.
The bonds were issued at a price of 99.537% of the nominal amount
The bonds mature on July 8, 2021.
Interest on bonds is paid semi-annually, and the principal will be paid in full at maturity. 
The interest coupon is fixed and amounts to 2.75% per annum. 
In July 2016, HRK 3.5 billion of bonds issued in 2011 matured and redeemed.
All Croatian bonds are listed on the first quotation of the Zagreb Stock Exchange, where at the end of 2016 a total of eleven bond issues were listed.
Borrowing through long-term loans • Loan on the domestic market in the amount of HRK 720 million In January 2015, the Republic of Croatia borrowed on the domestic financial market in the amount of HRK 720 million with an interest rate on 91-day treasury bills + 4.10%. 
The principal is repaid in seventeen equal quarterly installments, of which the first installment is due on December 22, 2015, and the last is due on December 22, 2019. 
Foreign currency syndicated loan in the amount of EUR 528.5 million In July 2015, the Republic of Croatia borrowed a long-term foreign currency syndicated loan in the amount of EUR 528.5 million with an interest rate of EUR 6 million + 3.70%.
Commitments In 2015, the Ministry of Finance assumed eleven credit commitments based on Decisions on granting consent to increase share capital by converting receivables based on debt assumption based on issued guarantees and unpaid obligatory payments to debtors.
Out of a total of eleven credit commitments, six credit commitments relate to the company HŽ Cargo d.o.o. 
Decision on giving consent for the increase of the share capital of the company HŽ Cargo d.o.o. was passed on May 21, 2015.
The assumed balance of the principal amounts to EUR 68.6 million, which is HRK 520.9 million in kuna equivalent. 
For the purpose of efficient public debt management, a decision was made on two credit indebtedness with Hrvatska poštanska banka d.d. (hereinafter: HPB) in order to assume the obligations of HŽ Cargo d.o.o. streamlined and repaid on more favorable terms.
The decision on borrowing of the Republic of Croatia in the amount of HRK 112 million with HPB was made to cover three commitments to HPB, and the Decision on borrowing of the Republic of Croatia in the amount of HRK 400 million with HPB was made in order to close less favorable parties with Erste & Steiermarkische Bank dd and Zagrebačka banka d.d. by this credit borrowing with more favorable terms.
Decision on giving consent for the increase of the share capital of the company HŽ Infrastruktura d.o.o. was enacted on December 23, 2014
The assumed balance of the principal debt is HRK 170 million and EUR 208.9 million, which is a total of HRK 1.8 billion. On September 24, 2015, the Government passed the Decision on giving consent for the increase of the share capital of the company HŽ Putnički prijevoz d.o.o. 
The decision took over the debt balance of EUR 100.7 million, which in kuna equivalent amounts to EUR 766 million.
The currency structure of debt at the end of 2016 shows the dominance of two currencies, the kuna and the euro. 
The share of debt denominated in euros is 65.0% of total government debt and is largely the result of the issuance of bonds denominated in euros and the use of project loans from international financial institutions.
In the part of debt denominated in euros, one part refers to debt denominated in euros, which is payable in HRK and accounts for 18.7% of total debt. 
Debt denominated in HRK accounts for 29.9% of total government debt and is the result of the orientation of borrowing on the domestic capital market, which also contributed to the development of a long-term yield curve in the national currency. 
Apart from the kuna and the euro, which dominate the currency structure, the share of dollar-denominated debt is 5%.
The significant increase in total financing needs and the high volatility of the Eurozone caused by the debt crisis of some members, necessitated the expansion of the investor base, primarily by issues of bonds denominated in US dollars
. The public debt management strategy in the past three years eliminated the currency risk by introducing hedging instruments (currency swaps), ie by replacing a significant part of dollar-denominated liabilities into euro liabilities, thus achieving a significant amount of savings. 
Five currency bond swap transactions were issued in the total amount of USD 7.5 billion, which transfers the issued dollar bonds and related interest at a pre-fixed USD / EUR ratio into euro liabilities, which eliminates the risk of unfavorable currency change.
The cross-section as at 31 December 2016 determined savings with respect to exchange rate movements in the amount of over HRK 11.6 billion on the amount of debt principal, thus avoiding negative exchange rate differences due to dollar volatility.
The projection does not include liabilities under treasury bills, which at the end of 2016 amounted to HRK 28.7 billion. 
Without the maturity of treasury bills, in 2017 it is necessary to repay long-term liabilities in the amount of HRK 27 billion.
The increased repayment burden in 2019 and 2020 is also visible, due to the maturity of bonds issued on the domestic and foreign markets.
Given that it is important for one of the tasks of public debt management to maintain an even repayment burden in the coming period, special attention will be paid to maintaining a uniform debt maturity.
The possibility of refinancing the existing debt on more favorable terms and with a longer repayment period is also retained, given the current situation on the financial markets.
In the debt structure in the period 2011-2016, there was a decrease in the domestic debt component, whose share in total debt decreased from 64.1% at the end of 2011 to approximately 58% at the end of 2016. 
The share of external debt increased from 35.9% at the end of 2011 to 42% of total government debt (end of 2016), mostly related to the issuance of international bonds and project loans of international financial institutions. 
Given the changed conditions in the financial markets and the changed domestic and global macroeconomic conditions, part of the total financing needs was realized by issuing Eurobonds on foreign markets, which affected the currency structure.
Looking at borrowing instruments, the largest part of government debt arose from borrowing through long-term securities, ie bonds (71.4%), followed by borrowing through loans (15.4%) and short-term securities (13.2%). 
Treasury bills The Ministry of Finance conducts treasury bill auctions in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of Treasury Bill Auctions using the electronic Bloomberg Auction System (BAS).
At auctions of treasury bills, the greatest interest is in treasury bills with a maturity of 364 days, so that as at 31 December 2016, the share of treasury bills with a maturity of HRK 28.9 billion in the total nominal amount of issued treasury bills of 364 days was 60.8%.
The share of treasury bills with a maturity of 455 days was 39.2%, while only 0.03% of treasury bills were subscribed with a maturity of 182 days.
From the end of 2012, the gradual reduction of interest rates on treasury bills for all types of issues will begin.
At the end of 2016, interest rates on kuna treasury bills were 0.4% on 91 days, 0.3% on 182 days and 0.65% on 364 days.
Interest rates on treasury bills with a currency clause were 0.05% on 364 days and 0.2% on 91 days. 
Throughout the observed period, the demand for treasury bills exceeds the amounts of issued treasury bills, with the trend of increased demand for treasury bills being particularly visible at the end of the observed period.
In the period 2011-2016, three issues of international bonds and six issues of bonds issued on the domestic capital market matured and redeemed
In analyzing and determining the source of the State Budget financing account in the period 2011-2016, the Republic of Croatia issued seven bonds on the foreign market and six government bonds on the domestic market. 
New bond issues on the domestic and foreign markets have contributed to the development of Croatian bond yield curves. 
This macroeconomic framework is identical to that of the State Budget of the Republic of Croatia for 2017 and projections for 2018 and 2019 and has been prepared on the basis of all indicators published so far and projections of budget categories. 
In doing so, the external assumptions are largely taken from the latest projections of the European Commission "Autumn 2016."
The recovery of economic activity started in 2015 will accelerate in 2016, in which real GDP growth of 2.7% is expected.
In the medium term, positive developments are expected to continue and economic activity to gradually accelerate.
In 2017 and 2018, GDP growth is projected at 3.2%, which will then accelerate to 3.3% in 2019. 
Economic growth throughout the projection period will be based solely on the contribution of domestic demand. 
The contribution of net foreign demand will be only slightly negative in 2016, somewhat more pronounced in 2017, and then stabilize by the end of the observed period.
The expected economic growth in the coming year will be significantly affected by the comprehensive tax reform with application from the beginning of 2017. 
Namely, the multiplier effect of the reform is estimated at 0.5% of GDP.
In other words, the growth rate in 2017 increased by approximately the same amount in percentage points compared to the baseline scenario without reform, which assumes growth of 2.7%, the same as in 2016. 
The initial effect of the reform is due to the estimated release of funds to households and enterprises in the amount of, respectively, 0.5% and 0.2% of GDP. 
In calculating the multiplier effect, it was assumed that both households and enterprises would, in the first case, spend and in the second invest approximately 70% of the released funds, taking into account the current point of the economic cycle.
The growth rates of individual components of the expenditure side of GDP calculation were also adjusted for the effects of the reform, with household spending slowing slightly compared to 2016 in the baseline scenario without the reform, while investment significantly accelerated its growth compared to 2016 in the baseline scenario.
Household consumption will be the main driver of domestic demand growth in the medium term.
Its continued recovery will be influenced by continued real growth in household disposable income, albeit at a slightly lower intensity than in the previous two years, and despite a strong change in the consumer price inflation rate between 2017 and 2016
Tax reform will also contribute significantly to this trend. 
The halting of the deleveraging process in the household sector is indicated by positive published data from the financial sector, which instill optimism about the future lending activity of banks, which, however, still largely avoid risk. 
In line with the continuation of fiscal consolidation, no significant contribution of government spending to economic growth is expected until the end of the medium term.
A key impetus to the projected dynamics of gross fixed capital formation is expected from the ongoing increase in the utilization rate of EU structural and investment funds. 
After the easing of most of the temporary effects in 2016, real growth in exports of goods and services will continue to move in line with the growth of foreign demand for domestic goods and services. 
At the same time, with a somewhat milder intensity than in previous years, the favorable movement of shares in the Croatian export markets will continue. 
Related to this, the growth of imports of goods and services went through most of the adjustment in 2016, due to the effects caused by EU accession, and will continue to monitor the dynamics of final demand at a lower level of elasticity to its change.
In 2017, after three years of stagnation, GDP deflator growth should reach 1.0%, primarily as a result of growth in household consumption deflators and commodity export deflators. 
In the remaining years of the projection period, inflation is expected to gradually accelerate in the context of the recovery in domestic demand, as well as the continued growth of commodity prices on the world market. 
The movement of consumer price inflation during 2017 will be significantly affected by the recovery in commodity prices on the world market, primarily due to the expected increase in oil prices. 
Also, the strengthening of household consumption and the growth of unit labor costs should act in the direction of growth of the consumer price index. 
The negative contribution due to changes in the VAT system in 2017 should be partially offset by an increase in excise duties on cigarettes. 
For the movement of deflators of exports and imports of goods and services in 2017, foreign price movements will play an important role. 
Also, an increase in the VAT rate on catering services will have an impact on increasing the deflator of services exports.
The recovery of economic activity had an extremely favorable effect on the labor market as early as 2015, and the continuation of such trends is expected to continue. 
Throughout the projection period, a constant decrease in the survey unemployment rate in the conditions of a declining labor force is envisaged, except in the last year of the observed period. 
The projection includes the assumption that, despite unfavorable overall demographic trends, economic recovery will have certain positive effects on the participation rate, which is supported by the fact of unfavorable structural characteristics of the Croatian labor market, primarily high share of long-term unemployed and long average duration of unemployment. 
As the projected GDP growth in all years of the projection period will be faster than employment growth, average labor productivity will increase, while it will accelerate significantly only at the end of the observed period.
The growth of unit labor costs will remain mild until the end of the period. 
The described macroeconomic scenario is exposed to predominantly negative risks, both external and domestic.
As a result of significant and growing EU integration, the risks that threaten expected developments in Europe are also having a strong impact on the domestic economy. 
All of them come down to achieving the expected dynamics of world economic growth, but also global trade.
 Let us single out here the uncertainty about the intensity of the adverse effect on growth due to the change in the trend of prices on the world market of raw materials, primarily oil.
As for domestic risks to the projected economic growth trajectory, they relate mainly to medium-term supply-side constraints.
Namely, the growth rates from this macroeconomic framework will inevitably lead to the rapid closing of the negative and the opening of the positive output gap, in the conditions of unfavorable long-term impacts from the aspect of each individual factor of production.
However, it should be mentioned here that the projected path of economic growth includes a strong investment cycle throughout the period, bearing in mind that the character of investment goods produces a certain self-generating effect on GDP growth.
The Republic of Croatia has credit ratings of three leading specialized credit rating agencies, namely: Moody's Investors Service (hereinafter: Moody's), Standard & Poor's (hereinafter: S&P) and Fitch Ratings (hereinafter: Fitch). 
In addition to the above, the Republic of Croatia has the rating of the Japanese rating agency Rating & Investment Information (hereinafter: R&I), which specializes in assigning ratings to issuers of securities in Japan. 
These agencies check the assigned credit rating every year.
Observing the development of the credit rating of the Republic of Croatia in the last six years, there is a significant decline in its rating since the end of 2012, which was primarily due to years of recession and weaker economic growth prospects and insufficient fiscal consolidation reflected in high budget deficits public debt. 
In the following years, the rating remained low.
In December 2016, the S&P agency improved its assessment of the credit rating from negative to stable based on the achieved macroeconomic and fiscal indicators. 
Therefore, in the forthcoming period, one of the goals of the Government of the Republic of Croatia will be to improve the international credit rating based on the expected positive effects of the existing fiscal projections. 
An overview of the credit rating of the Republic of Croatia is shown in Table 4 with a comparison with EU Member States.
Public debt sustainability is a key macroeconomic risk to the Croatian economy. 
Therefore, it is extremely important to achieve the planned fiscal adjustment aimed at returning the share of public debt to GDP to a sustainable trajectory. 
For this reason, the Program of the Government of the Republic of Croatia for the term 2016-2020 states that the sustainability of public finances will continue to be strengthened because the stability of public finances is the foundation of sustainable economic growth, but also of overall economic stability. 
This means a further reduction of the budget deficit, which will be reflected in a reduction in the share of debt in GDP and in general enable a reduction in the cost of interest that the Republic of Croatia pays on public debt today. 
Consequently, the basic strategic goal of the Government of the Republic of Croatia and the national priority is to reduce the share of public debt in GDP by more than 10 percentage points by the end of 2020.
Based on the existing fiscal projections of the state budget for the period 2017-2019 and in accordance with the projected trends in revenues and expenditures of other levels of the general government budget, including estimates of deficit / surplus of public enterprises and other units included in the general government sector according to ESA 2010 methodology, the planned general government deficit is expected to be 1.6% of GDP in 2017, 1.0% in 2018, and 0.6% of GDP in 2019, respectively 
In line with the consolidated general government deficit, and taking into account the planned privatization receipts and the change in the balance of deposits, the share of public debt in GDP is expected to decrease in 2016 and amount to 83.9% of GDP.
This will meet the preconditions for the Republic of Croatia to exit the excessive budget deficit procedure, while continuing to pursue a sustainable, reasonable and balanced fiscal policy, and ensure the return of the credit rating to the level of investment and permanent reduction of the debt burden. 
With further implementation of fiscal consolidation and reduction of the general government budget deficit and activation of state assets or privatization receipts in the amount of HRK 1.4 billion per year, the share of public debt in GDP will continue to decrease to 81.5% of GDP in 2017 ., 78.6% of GDP in 2018, while public debt in 2019 will amount to 75.3% of GDP
Existing macroeconomic projections in the short run suggest mitigating refinancing risk and reversing the multi-year trend of excessive year-on-year growth rates of the public debt-to-GDP ratio. 
As already pointed out, the high level of public debt required requires a comprehensive economic policy aimed at stimulating economic growth, further fiscal consolidation and activation of state assets accompanied by an active public debt management policy. 
The main goal of borrowing and debt management is to ensure the financial needs of the state budget by achieving the lowest medium- and long-term cost of financing while assuming a prudent level of risk.
In order to meet the general objective of debt management, the Strategy defines, in addition to the basic objective, implementation methods for improving the sustainability of total public debt and mitigating the associated risks.
In addition to detailed overviews of historical trends and structure of public debt, three-year projections and principles of realization of established financing plans, the Strategy identifies implementation risks and principles of their mitigation, with emphasis on: 1. strengthening the legal and institutional framework of public debt management; reduction of the share of short-term debt in total public debt, 3. mitigation of currency risk of public debt, 4. mitigation of interest rate risk of public debt and 5. increase of transparency of public debt and borrowing.
The existing legal framework for public debt management, primarily the provisions of the Budget Act, provides a relatively satisfactory implementation and control framework with the necessary flexibility at the level of the central budget, extrabudgetary users and local and regional self-government units.
Over the past period, there has been a need to strengthen the control of the operations of public enterprises that are included in the general government sector in accordance with the ESA 2010 methodology. 
Consequently, the existing legal framework will be analyzed in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the control mechanism of such companies, and to review and comprehensively define the objectives and respect the constraints of fiscal policy.
Furthermore, in order to fully align national legislation with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact and the recommendations of the EU Council within the European Semester, it is necessary to adopt a new Law on Fiscal Responsibility. 
The said Law will establish numerical fiscal rules which include the structural balance rule, the expenditure rule and the public debt rule.
According to EU legal provisions, the public debt rule defines that the share of public debt in GDP must not exceed the 60% reference value.
If the public debt ratio exceeds the 60% reference value, the difference between the public debt share in GDP and the 60% reference value must be reduced at an average rate of one twentieth per year over the next three years, from the year in which the public debt share is GDP exceeded the 60% reference value.
According to the currently valid Decree on the Internal Organization of the Ministry of Finance, activities related to public debt management are within the scope of the Public Debt Management Sector as organizational units within the State Treasury. 
Institutional and administrative capacities should adequately follow the objectives of public debt management set by this Strategy, and therefore it is necessary to organize the work of this sector at the administrative level through changes in the internal structure of the Ministry of Finance.
Mitigating refinancing risk and reducing the share of short-term debt in total public debt The current level of public debt and the established structure of annual principal repayments generate the need for significant refinancing in annual amounts of up to 20% of GDP.
The existing relatively favorable conditions on the financial markets provide an opportunity to extend the average debt maturity and balance the maturity profile, while reducing the share of short-term debt in total public debt. 
Although the structure of total public debt is the majority domestic component, its predominant part (about 75%) is denominated or indexed in euros. 
This currency risk cannot be eliminated in the short term, but conditions in the domestic capital market allow for its partial mitigation as kuna sources have provided an adequate alternative to currency denominated ones in terms of their scope, available maturity and price over the past 18 months.
The share of the kuna component in the total debt is projected to increase further through primary issues on the domestic market, as well as through the possibility of replacing part of the existing currency instruments with kuna in case of such preferences of financial institutions regarding capital requirements adjustments. 
Mitigating interest rate risk on public debt given the high overall level of indebtedness, a long-term increase in reference market interest rates would pose a significant threat to fiscal sustainability and consequently generate a significant increase in public debt. 
In the short run, this threat has been mitigated by the existing structure of interest rates in which, at the level of government budget debt, more than 86% of long-term liabilities are fixed interest rate instruments.
Also, in the short run, current market conditions suggest refinancing the maturity of existing liabilities with a lower nominal interest rate compared to the contractual maturity of the liabilities.
In the medium term, this risk can be mitigated by the consistent implementation of a sustainable fiscal policy and the consequent improvement of the country's credit rating, and thus by the reduction of the existing high risk premium.
Increasing the transparency of public debt and borrowing Significant emphasis in this three-year Strategy is given to increasing the transparency of public debt and borrowing, which is reflected in the publicly announced plans, conditions and rules of borrowing.
Therefore, in order to inform potential investors as clearly as possible and ensure better predictability of borrowing, the Strategy presents projection of the state budget borrowing plan until 2019.
In 2017, the state budget deficit amounts to HRK 6.8 billion, and total government debt repayments, which include short-term and long-term debt, amount to HRK 55.4 billion. 
As the total borrowing needs, in addition to the above, are affected by liabilities based on loans and deposits and shares and equity shares, as well as the amount of cash deposit carried over from the previous budget year, or carried over to the next budget year, the total borrowing need in 2017, it was set at HRK 65.3 billion.
In the structure of total repayments in 2017, short-term debt, ie expenditures for repayment of principal for issued treasury bills, amounted to HRK 28.7 billion. 
The 2017 state budget financing account envisages keeping the balance of treasury bills at the level of the balance on 31 December 2016, which means that in 2017 treasury bills will be renewed in the amount of liabilities based on repayment of issued treasury bills to be paid in 2017. years. 
In the structure of repayment of long-term debt amounting to HRK 26.7 billion, expenditures for repayment of the principal of domestic bonds and loans account for HRK 16.8 billion, and foreign liabilities for HRK 9.9 billion.
The settlement of domestic government debt is planned through the issuance of bonds on the domestic market in the amount of HRK 14 billion, while through domestic loans it is planned to borrow in the amount of HRK 5.9 billion.
With regard to foreign liabilities payable in 2017, the most significant of which relate to principal and interest on foreign bonds maturing in April 2017 in the amount of HRK 8.9 billion, borrowing on the foreign market through the issuance of bonds and foreign bonds is envisaged. loans totaling HRK 13.2 billion. 
The largest part of the funds will be used to pay liabilities based on the high state debt, and the remaining funds will be used to finance other foreign currency liabilities of the state budget during the year. 
The projections for 2018 and 2019 reduce the state budget deficit, so that in 2018 it amounts to HRK 5.7 billion, and in 2019 to HRK 3.9 billion.
In the same period, there will be a decrease in total liabilities based on the state budget debt compared to the total liabilities determined in 2017, so in 2018 they amount to HRK 45.6 billion, and in 2019 to HRK 49.9 billion, which will significantly affect the movement of the overall level of indebtedness.
Taking into account the established data, the total borrowing needs in 2018 are significantly reduced compared to 2017 and amount to HRK 52.9 billion, and in 2019 to HRK 54.5 billion. 
Compared to 2017, the projections for 2018 and 2019 predict a trend of gradual reduction of short-term debt (treasury bills) by HRK 1.1 billion in 2018, and by an additional HRK 500 million in 2019.
In recent years, the growth of public debt has been greatly influenced by the so-called the effect of a snowball, resulting from the difference between the cost of government funding and nominal GDP growth. 
As the interest rate in recent years has been significantly higher than nominal GDP growth, this has led to an automatic increase in public debt. 
Thus, in the period 2011-2015, the effect of a snowball can explain half of the increase in public debt.
Given the level of indebtedness, a long-term increase in reference market interest rates would pose a significant threat to fiscal sustainability and consequently generate a large increase in public debt. 
An increase in the cost of financing would lead to an increase in the burden of debt repayment and interest payments, which would create significant pressure on the current operations of the state.
Thus, in the scenario of increasing the average implicit interest rate on debt by 1 percentage point in the period 2017-2019, public debt would grow above the projected and at the end of the projection period would be higher by 2.3 percentage points than in the baseline scenario. 
Furthermore, with regard to the negative effects on the movement of public debt in the medium term, the risk of a significant change in the exchange rate of the domestic currency should be singled out.
Namely, bearing in mind the fact that almost 75% of the total public debt is denominated in euros, the depreciation of the domestic currency would result in a higher level of public debt as well as more difficult servicing of the same. 
The sensitivity test shows that the depreciation of the kuna against the euro of 15% raises the level of public debt to 90.5% of GDP in 2017.
In addition, taking into account the fact of activating guarantees or taking over the debts of state-owned companies in public debt in recent years, public companies continue to pose a potential major risk to public finances.
Thus, in the assumed scenario of taking guarantees into public debt in the amount of 2% of GDP, public debt would reach the level of 83.5% of GDP in 2017. 
Therefore, it is crucial to implement the process of financial and business restructuring among beneficiaries of state guarantees in order to increase the efficiency and sustainability of their operations and thus reduce potential risks of activating state guarantees, which are reflected in negative effects on fiscal aggregates and budget deficit and public debt. 
On the other hand, higher economic growth rates would have the effect of accelerating the reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium term. 
Thus, in the scenario of stronger GDP growth by 1 percentage point in each year compared to the baseline scenario, public debt would be reduced to the level of 73.2% of GDP in 2019.
Today in Pula, Prime Minister Plenković expressed his satisfaction with the progress of works on the completion of the Istrian Y on the section from Pazin to Učka. 
We expect the works to be completed by July 1, ie six months before the scheduled deadline, which will practically complete the construction of the Istrian Y in full profile, worth HRK 155 million," the Prime Minister announced.
Today, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković is visiting the County of Istria, which began in the Milanezi Business Zone in Višnjan and visiting the Sanitary Wastewater Treatment Plant.
He then met in Pula with Fabrizio Radin, Deputy Prefect and acting Mayor of Pula Boris Miletić, and attended the delivery of the Decision on the allocation of funds 
In a statement for the media after the meeting, he assessed the talks on the topic of further development of that county as very meaningful.
He singled out several topics of today's conversation. 
First of all, the project of sanitary water purifier in Višnjan, realized in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy, Hrvatske vode and the Municipality of Višnjan, worth over 13 million kuna.
A beautiful example of landscaping, in the wake of our environmental policy, which allows sanitary water to be converted into both technological water and soil food, which throws practically only 1% of waste, "said Prime Minister Plenković, noting that such examples throughout Croatia show care for the environment.
HRK 680 million for the preservation of jobs in the Covid crisis in Istria
The contract on the fishing port of Santa Marina in Porec, worth 37 million kuna, is an important support to fisheries, said Prime Minister Plenković.
We have a renaissance of the entire Croatian coast during our term, and we are investing especially through the Ministry of Agriculture, encouraging fisheries," he said.
Regarding the cooperation between the Government and the county so far, Prime Minister Plenković pointed out 2.5 billion projects from European funds, which shows, he added, how agile people in Istria are in preparing quality projects and absorbing funds.
To preserve jobs in the Covid crisis, he reminded, the Government paid 680 million kuna for over 86 thousand workers in Istria.
This shows, as throughout Croatia, that compared to March 31 last year, there were 17,000 more insured persons on March 31 this year, which means that we managed to maintain employment and bridge all aspects of Covid-19 for the labor market and for work. of our economy, ”he stressed.
He said that Minister Butković was also in Istria today, signing a contract with a Slovenian colleague on the construction of a bridge over the Dragonja, and expressed satisfaction with the good progress of work on the completion of the Istrian Y on the section from Pazin to Učka.
We expect the works to be completed by July 1, ie six months before the scheduled deadline, which will practically complete the construction of the Istrian Y in full profile, worth HRK 155 million," the Prime Minister announced.
As for the Učka tunnel, he reminded that works on the new tunnel pipe started a few weeks ago, and the project worth almost 200 million kuna will enable even better flow of goods and people from Istria County to other road infrastructure in Croatia. 
That project should be completed by 2023, he added.
It is one of the largest construction sites in Istria, more than 1000 workers from several Croatian construction companies.
Today, the development of the University of Pula was especially discussed, said the Prime Minister, expressing the Government's support for the wish of the prefect and the mayor to establish a medical faculty at the University, given the 750 million kuna investment in the Pula General Hospital.
In this way, we would encourage Pula to be an important educational center that will attract students, not only from Croatia but also from other parts of Europe," said Prime Minister Plenković, emphasizing the excellent cooperation throughout the previous term and expressing confidence that it will continue in the term. which comes after the local elections in May on the development of Istria County and the whole of Croatia.
The government guarantee enabled Uljanik to restart production
Prime Minister Plenković also visited the Archaeological Museum of Istria, and at the end of his visit to that county he met with representatives of Uljanik Brodogradnja 1856, led by the director of the shipyard Samir Hadžić.
In the Archaeological Museum of Istria, the Prime Minister said, in cooperation with the Ministry of Culture, a large investment of 110 million kuna was realized, which further enriched the tourist offer and the historical heritage of Pula.
The government has given a guarantee for the resumption of production in Uljanik, which should be economically and market viable.
We believe that shipbuilding here in Istria, in Pula, and Uljanik is also a symbol of the city of Pula and is important for the economy, in a well-organized and monitored and controlled way can be useful and successful," he said.
As for health care reform, Prime Minister Plenković said that he had given Finance Minister Marić and Health Minister Beroš a very clear task a few weeks ago to solve the problem with wholesalers and they had solved it.
We are all aware that the issue of health care financing and health care expenditures has been on the agenda of all Croatian governments for the past 30 years. 
He explained that the reform of health care should be undertaken primarily by all those who work in health care, ie make efforts to reduce expenditures that are extremely high and continuously growing.
I think that an effort should be made on the expenditure side with more functional connections and better organization of public procurement, greater centralization, controls, savings, and in that way we could certainly make important strides," he said.
It is easiest, he added, to say: let's increase the allocation for health care a little more, which is on average around 3,100 euros in the EU, and around 860 in Croatia, so we will cover the costs.
He added that the health care reform is ongoing and that many laws concerning health care have already been passed in both the previous and this term.
In any case, if the new laws are ready and if Minister Beros and his associates have prepared them, we can put them on the government next week," he said.
Unlike the opposition, said the Prime Minister, who was practically looking forward to the possibility of wholesalers denying the delivery of medicines to Croatian health care institutions, the HDZ government did everything to solve this problem and agree on the dynamics of payment of debts arising primarily from health care institution, because it is not a debt generated by the Government.
The government has been working on the Recovery and Resilience Plan for eight months, the opposition has not contributed anything at all
He also responded to SDP President Grbin's comments on the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.
He said that Mr. Grbin was cemented to 16%, and that the opposition in the parliamentary debate on that document two days ago showed vanity, hollowness, uncreativeness, lack of information and knowledge.
He stressed that the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience is a comprehensive plan that has been working for eight months, and the opposition has not contributed anything to that.
He rejected Mr. Grbin's thesis that Croatia received more funds because it was the worst as false.
We have received a lot of funding because we have skillfully and skillfully fought politically for it at the European Council level in the distribution of funds and from the next generation EU Instrument, where we have € 9.9 billion at our disposal.
Financial framework, then more than a billion euros from the European Solidarity Fund for earthquake reconstruction, plus 5 billion euros over the next three years from the last financial perspective, "he said, noting that it was his government that boosted the absorption of European funds.
Prime Minister Plenković pointed out today at the Conference on Earthquake Engineering that the earthquake in Zagreb and surrounding counties damaged 25 thousand buildings and houses, and the damage is estimated at 86 billion kuna, which is about 60% of the state budget. 
It is clear that we will have to work for years to repair the damage on such a huge scale and provide huge financial resources for that, which in the current difficult economic situation will require even more responsible management of public finances," he said.
the earthquake in Zagreb and surrounding counties damaged 25,000 buildings and houses, and the damage is estimated at 86 billion kuna, which is about 60% of the state budget.
It is clear that we will have to work for years to repair such a huge damage and provide huge financial resources for that, which in the current demanding economic situation will require the Government to manage public finances even more responsibly.
Aware of the long-standing challenge before us, to this extraordinary circumstance, and the greatest disaster that has hit Zagreb since the catastrophic floods of 1964, we have responded with a combination of urgent, medium-term and long-term measures.
When it comes to emergency measures, it must be said that in the beginning, the most important thing was the efficient and coordinated action of all emergency services that really quickly helped the victims. It was a good combination of the work of state and city institutions.
We quickly defined intervention measures, provided HRK 141 million for them and started drafting the law.
We provided a one-time assistance of HRK 12,000 for the renovation of the roof, chimneys, gables and the purchase of condensing boilers.
After the earthquake in Petrinja, which caused new damage in the wider Zagreb area, we extended until March 1, 2022 the co-financing of temporary accommodation for all those who still cannot return to their homes, for which 6.7 million kuna has been paid so far.
So far, our intensive activities at all levels for the reconstruction, reconstruction and revitalization of affected areas are in the process of securing, according to our estimates at the moment, 3.8 billion euros, or 28.5 billion kuna, which is about 22% of the required funds.
Of that, almost 1.4 billion euros are from European sources and 2.4 billion euros through international financial institutions.
European funds include 684 million euros from the Solidarity Fund for the Reconstruction of Zagreb, we plan almost 600 million euros from the Mechanism for Recovery and Resilience, ie from the EU next generation instrument, and from the existing Multiannual Financial Framework from the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Cohesion 111 million euros .
In addition, we will seek to secure additional funding from the new EU Multiannual Financial Framework, where we will also seek items for the reconstruction process.
When it comes to international financial institutions, in addition to the already signed loan of 184 million euros from the World Bank, we are talking about an additional billion euros from the European Investment Bank, 900 million euros from the Council of Europe Development Bank and 300 million euros from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
However, in addition, funds will have to be added, which will be remitted from the European Solidarity Fund, following the request we submitted after the summary of damages in the Banovina.
In this process, I would like to thank the contribution of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and cooperation with the World Bank and all experts, because this expert background of Croatian experts with a coordinated and internationally verified methodology of damage assessment helped Croatia to obtain funds in an adequate way.
In this regard, the line ministries and the City of Zagreb have already issued public calls for the renovation of buildings in the field of education, cultural heritage, transport infrastructure and health, these are four components that have already been announced for the City of Zagreb and neighboring counties.
Restoration of the cultural and historical ensemble of Zagreb
In the restoration of cultural heritage, modern knowledge and technologies of restoration and restoration will be applied, with the application of the principles of energy efficiency whenever possible.
Compared to 2017, the projections for 2018 and 2019 predict a trend of gradual reduction of short-term debt (treasury bills) by HRK 1.1 billion in 2018, and by an additional HRK 500 million in 2019.
All our efforts are focused on providing funds for earthquake strengthening of buildings and on facilitating the financing of reconstruction for citizens.
In parallel, we are continuously in talks with a number of development and commercial banks to agree on solutions that will provide citizens with credit lines with favorable interest rates for the needs of financing the reconstruction.
This should primarily concern: the financing of their share of 20% of renovation costs, the financing of the difference in costs between structural and complete renovation, the financing of the renovation of apartment buildings, as well as the financing of state renovation of public buildings.
So far, over 1,700 mobile units, 1,300 housing containers, 400 mobile homes have been installed, along with a special container settlement at the Fairgrounds in Petrinja.
Thanks to the exceptional contribution of more than 1,700 engineers and structural engineers from all over Croatia, in the past two and a half months, about 41,000 rapid inspections were performed to assess damage and usability of buildings out of a total of 49,700 applications, or over 82%.
