Interview of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance for Montenegro Business Outlook
How do you assess the Montenegrin economy in light of the current global crisis?
Over the last few weeks we have held a series of meetings with representatives from the economic sector, trade unions and the banking sector. 
We are aware of the problems being encountered by our economy at the present time and would like to try to help by approving new requests from customers who have successfully completed previous investments, by initiating new ones, by improving credit and liquidity facilities, paying in services etc.
Of course, this situation has affected businessmen the most, in particular those who, during previous years, made their investments based on the premise of moving from one credit to another. 
It is equally important that businessmen also undertake certain measures, especially in areas related to reducing costs, liquidity enhancement and building reserves. 
This was, indeed, our recommendation in the past and it has been proved to be justifiable advice However, we hope that the new fiscal policy measures that we, the government, have predicted for 2009, along with our commitment to ensure long-term loans with international institutions, will help our economy to remain stable under conditions of economic and financial crises.
Does the Montenegrin economy differ from others in SouthEastern Europe? 
If there are differences, to what extent could these differences influence the way that the current crisis is impacting on Montenegro? Could it also result in different consequences in Montenegro in comparison with other countries in the region?
All the countries in the region are small economies which have been developed through, the same development matrix. The thing that distinguishes us is the specific policy which we are carrying out. 
Through the economic policy that has been carried out over recent previous years, we have created an economy that is founded on solid ground, and is flexible and able to adjust even to this extreme external situation. 
We have sought to create a favorable ambience for institutions and te payment of taxes in order to develop entrepreneurial initiatives, to eliminate barriers and to stimulate the start up of small and medium sized enterprises. 
Such policy has placed us in the position of being one of the fastest growing economies and in the position of being one of the most competitive countries in the region
The fact that makes our economy different from surrounding ones is the stability of the currency. This is the one thing that other countries cannot be proud of. 
We have recently repeated on a number of occasions that the fact that Montenegro is a small and open economy can be as much of an advantage as a problem in such a situation. This is because, as a small state, we are more exposed to external influences.
According to you, what is the role of the state in such a situation of crisis?
The state is not the driving force for economic processes, but rather someone who envisages and creates a good institutional framework. In a situation of economic crisis, its role remains the same.
Any responsible state must be one step ahead during a situation of economic crisis, monitoring world trends, listening to the needs of the economy, the banking sector and the overall society. 
We, the state, have during recent times shown responsibility and have taken the situation very seriously. We have prepared packages, including fiscal, monetary and socio-economic measures, which we hope will mitigate the consequences of the economic crisis in respect of the Montenegrin economy. This represents about 10% of the GDP, which is more than all European contributions put together. 
In such situations of financial crisis, governments are expected to do a great deal.
The economy, investors and citizens all expect that the government can solve the problems they are encountering.
We are aware that we cannot isolate and save our economy from this global virus, but we have tried to predict the situation where possible and have put forward measures which should reduce the consequences and keep economic growth at the same level as in previous years.
More developed countries have also been unable to find an answer about how to survive the crisis with minimum consequences. 
We hope that by continuing tax reforms, by starting investments, by decreasing consumption and by strengthening capital, by subsidizing electricity for households and businesses, and by developing programs for entrepreneurship, we will succeed in achieving positive balances at the end of next year.
However, during this situation of economic crisis, we are ready to adopt alternative scenarios and adjust our solutions on a month by month basis, by monitoring world developments.
What, in your opinion, is the most significant advantage of Montenegro? How can that advantage be used, but not endangered, at the same time?
Montenegro is small and attractive tourism destination which, on the road to EU accession, has shown its political maturity which has also been reflected by economic development. 
During recent times, as a result of following a policy to preserve stability, a huge inflow of direct foreign investments and a low tax policy, Montenegro has been included in the list of the most competitive countries in Europe. 
Additionally, the strategic commitment of the Government, which in its economic policy defined tourism, the energy sector and agriculture as both its strategic and priority fields of economy development, made us into an interesting and attractive proposition for investment.
What are your expectations for 2009?
What trends can be expected in the banking sector, in capital or in the real estate market? 
How do you expect the private sector to react to market challenges?
Although it is very hard to make prognoses for 2009 in the current situation of economic crisis, where the situation is changing almost daily, we expect that economic growth will continue.
In previous years, share prices on stock markets have been unreasonably high, just as they are now unreasonably low, due to mistrust in the stock market.
 I believe that a domestic stock recovery would be reliant on the recovery of international stock markets.
Similarly, over the last few years, we saw an explosion of real estate prices and now find ourselves in the situation where construction prices are falling. Therefore, I predict that we will definitely see prices stagnate in the real estate market over following months. 
Our banking sector is currently stable. We, the Government, have undertaken all necessary measures in order to protect deposits made by citizens and by the economy as well as trying to ensure the protection of the entire system. 
What we expect, for sure, is continued credit activity, a mild increase in interest rates in accordance with growth in the international banking market. 
Regarding the private sector, I think that the situation there is also stable and that our economy is well prepared for this crisis. However, I do not believe that this is the case for those entities which were the most exposed to the crisis, but this is a situation that we share with the rest of the world. 
As the Government, we have undertaken all possible fiscal policy measures in order to make this situation more bearable.
CEED and the Montenegro Business Alliance (MBA), amongst others, have participated in research and in working groups to draft some of the current commercial laws, They are also responsible for carrying out research for the international institutions who define the level of economic freedom and business management expenses.
Do you think that the Government of Montenegro and your ministry have benefited from such research and analysis? What is your level of cooperation with other national and foreign institutions?
Certainly, the Government has often used research and documents prepared by non-government sector organizations, and these have, indeed, later been used to prepare regulations, strategies and other strategic documents, due to their objectivity in analyzing current developments. 
As is the case with international analysis, analysis conducted by local experts can be equally very useful in eliminating business barriers, in improving institutional environments etc. 
The Ministry of Finance has, so far, had very positive experience in its work with national and foreign institutions. I believe that a view from another perspective is always valuable as it helps to ensure that actions are executed in the best way.
Do you find international comparisons and analyses, such as economic freedom and credit ratings, important for Montenegro? Do they influence your decisions?
International comparisons and analyses are recognized as a good guide and compass for countries and their investors. 
States use such analyses to detect weaknesses in their economic policies and to identify business barriers, as well as for finding weaknesses in their social and economic systems. 
Where investors are concerned, they have used this research in order to assess investment risks. 
The Ministry of Finance follows these analyses, and has, in accordance with international recommendations, worked on indicator improvement to increase their ranking both on their own records and also with investors.
We expect that, during the coming period, we will continue to improve our rating in various economic freedom and business environment studies.
In your opinion, which institutions have played the most important role in Montenegrin reform process so far?
It is hard to exclude anyone from the process that is both behind and in front of us
In all ways, all institutions involved in the process of accession to the European Union have shown great involvement in the areas of tax, financial, legal and monetary reforms. 
Also, coupled with the Government, the Trade Union and the Union of Employers have proved to be an excellent model for any responsible government. Thus, in a situation where the entire world is facing global economic shocks, this is the only way to overcome the crisis.
The decline in the liquidity of economy resulted in continuous growth of number of companies whose accounts are frozen.
Internal debt is becoming higher.
Is the Ministry of Finance going to take any action in that respect? Would multilateral compensation with the State participation be adequate solution at this moment?
If the information on the number of companies whose accounts are frozen is analysed more thoroughly, a slight declining trend is evident as compared to the last two years.
However, such statistics does not encourage, since the number of the companies whose accounts are frozen is still high, and the circles of so called creditor-debtor relationship are created.
Since the beginning of this problem, the Ministry of Finance and the Government, within their authority, have been trying to resolve it. 
This primarily refers to regular execution of all budget liabilities and comprehensive package of anti-crisis measures of about 10% of GDP, constant measures of tax relief to economy, provision of guarantees for corporate sector lending by international financial institutions, establishment of Investment Development Fund.
Therefore, we try to help by creating favourable environment which will enable better conditions for the activities of the companies, but this process must be two-fold – the economy should also prepare qualitative and sustainable projects that would create new value.
One should be careful when considering the possibility of introducing multilateral compensation as an instrument. 
It may be a tool for resolving specific cases, but it cannot represent a permanent solution of this issue.
Simultaneously, this was practice in the previous period which was abandoned, inter alia, through the reform of the treasury system in Montenegro.
 Illiquidity problem should be resolved by creating systemic, long-term solutions and/or policies, which is, in my opinion, already preformed through the economic policy measures.
What is your opinion on establishing interbank money market and secondary securities market, which would significantly facilitate potential liquidity problems and encourage increased securities trade?
The establishment of interbank money market would facilitate finding of additional sources of liquidity for banks.
However, for this type of market to become operational, banks should recognise their interest in the existence of such market. 
On the other hand, secondary securities market already exists, but it should be further developed and “deepened” by new instruments. 
This is the expected next stage of the development of the financial market in Montenegro.
The assessments of reference researches also point to this, primarily EBRD Transition Report, which mentioned, as one of the deficiencies of the financial market in Montenegro, lack of “sophistication” of instruments. 
Global economy developments influenced on vertiginous growth rates at financial markets, and they have subsequently caused vertiginous declining rates. 
In that respect, I expect that market will recover gradually with regard to the trade volume, diversification and type of instruments. 
Currently, drafting new Investment Funds Law is underway as well as the preparation of the amendments to the Voluntary Pension Funds Law.
I believe that new regulation will additionally assist the development of financial markets.
Criticism of banks and their lending policy is often heard. 
You are one of rare persons that has recently defended them saying that they are working under market principles and in accordance with the international rules.
The fact stands that we have witnessed criticism addressed to banking sector for some time. It is important to understand the position of each market player and my statement was directed to that.
Both banks and companies, by default, have interest to make profit.
Something that represents income to a bank represents the expense to a company and vice versa. 
This is the basics of each exchange that occurs at the market. 
The goals of both banks and companies may be achieved only if they are based on their mutual voluntary cooperation. 
The State, as intermediary or participant in this exchange, may make higher damage than benefit in a long run. Therefore, I am very reluctant with regard to any State interventions in the financial system and creditor-debtor relationship.
Banking sector is more stable now as compared to the previous year.
Banking sector has initiated a new development and growth stage?
Which is shown by the key sector indicators. 
Those indicators primarily refer to liquidity ratio and solvency ratio, which are above the minimum prescribed level.
The level and structure of deposits is also stable.
Banking sector is not characterised by growth rates from the period of economic expansion, but it is important that there is an uptrend in recovery.
Recently I have held a meeting with the banks representatives in Montenegro and I was pleased to hear that the majority of banks have announced their lending activity growth in the current year. 
The announced lending growth rates will contribute to the economic growth rates which we have planned in economic policy.
A new, modern regulatory framework for the banking sector has been recently established.
Simultaneously, the supervisor loosened its demands by adopting appropriate secondary legislation.
 The banks will also face additional harmonisation of their activities with the international standards.
In the combination of expectations and possibilities like this, I believe that a certain dosage of an increased concern and nervous is behind us and that the banking sector has initiated new development and growth stage.
Banks in Montenegro have qualitative cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, which was particularly evident in using EIB and KfW loans and in support provided to banks during crisis by adopting the special Law.
Where do you see the area for strengthening the cooperation in the forthcoming period?
The cooperation between the commercial banks and the Ministry of Finance has been very successful on an ongoing basis. EIB and KfW support to SME projects are the examples of how significant funds can be obtained under preferential conditions for banks and companies by minimising risk to the State.
Systemic cooperation between the Ministry and the Association of Banks and individual commercial banks include continuous strengthening of business environment for banks primarily in the part regarding amendments to the legislation, while current cooperation primarily includes the financing of the significant capital projects.
Finally, the most qualitative cooperation between private and public sector reflects in the efficient execution of obligations and tasks.
The State should create favourable legal and institutional framework, implement efficiently laws and protects property rights.
Then the banks will have better basis to support more successful projects.
Immediately after you have become the Ministry of Finance, the information on possible new bonds issue emerged.
Is it to expect the announced arrangement with IMF?
Indebtedness in 2011 is defined in the Budget Law, which projected indebtedness of EUR 180 million and additional EUR 53 million for the realisation of infrastructure projects. 
Last year we had the first experience regarding the bond issue in the amount of EUR 200 million, which was successful, particularly in respect of total demand and number of investors. 
Currently we are preparing new issue of Eurobonds which should be realised in the first part of the year.
Surely, in my opinion, it is not good to define the precise timing in advance, but we carefully monitor market developments, which will determine, in line with our needs and potential investors’ interest, the best timing for the second bond issue.
The preparation of the process of Eurobond issue is important not only for the purpose of providing missing funds, but for creating the possibility to the State, its economy and private sector to present themselves to large number of investors.
Economic and financial crisis significantly influenced on the IMF role increasing significantly its financial potential to support actively member countries in overcoming the crisis, while, on the other hand, the significant changes occurred in the management of this international organisation.
 Countries that have significantly increased their relative importance in global economy during the last ten year period, such as China and India, obtained higher quotas in this institution, which became more legitimate than it used to be.
 IMF has introduced some new financial instruments lately, but it has also adapted conditioning concept which usually follows its arrangements.
In that direction goes the potential arrangement with IMF through credit line of precaution, which represents additional mechanism before us that we can discuss on if necessary.
Do you expect that the projected budget will be fully realised? What is the situation with capital investments?
Budget for 2011 was projected using the sustainability principle. 
Depending of the expenses movements as well as revenues, the Ministry of Finance may act during the year using adequate internal measures to reduce spending.
Bearing in mind the projected decline in expenditures, we expect that the budget will be fully realised in majority of beneficiaries. 
There is a risk that the realisation of some expenditures will be higher than it was planned. 
This primarily refers to pensions and social contributions.
Depending of the expenses movements as well as revenues, the Ministry of Finance may act during the year using adequate internal measures to reduce spending.
Capital budget is planned above the achieved one for 2010. 
Experience showed that the dynamics of capital expenditure cannot be easily anticipated. 
However, it is up to us to create conditions for the realisation of overall capital budget, particularly bearing in mind its multiple effects on economy.
It has been heard for many times that the development of entrepreneurship, small and medium enterprises represents a priority for the Government and other institutions that are concerned for the development of Montenegrin economy. 
What is your plan in the current year that would improve specific results in that respect?
Improvement of business environment is one of the priority policies of the Government of Montenegro. 
Besides the legislation framework that we try to improve and simplify, our objective is to develop different social awareness towards the business and entrepreneurship in Montenegro. 
Primarily, our goal is to raise awareness of the state administration and citizens that higher number of small and medium enterprises will means higher salaries and better life standard.
In that respect, our aspiration is to create efficient state administration which would serve to the companies and citizens, and to develop entrepreneurial aspirations with citizens.
We are aware of the fact that mental transition is the slowest one and the most difficult to achieve. 
In terms of specific measures for the improvement of conditions for doing business, the priorities for this year are the following: combine procedure for registering companies into one institution, simplify procedure for issuing building permits, facilitate procedures for tax and contribution payments, improve the procedure of contract execution, and create easier conditions for employing foreigners in Montenegro.
What are the main directions of Montenegrin economy development? What are the most important sectors of the economy?
Development and economy have not been determined. 
The velocity of technological changes and globalisation influences on the implementation of those business policies and ideas which implementation could not be imagined several years ago. 
Therefore I would not opt for the most important sectors of the economy.
I would rather lean towards the establishing of general policies and institutional solutions that will not limit, but encourage individuals and companies to express their creativity, entrepreneurial spirit and desire to succeed, to develop their ideas thereby developing also the economy.
Has Montenegrin economy got out of crisis, and what are the consequences?
How do you se global situation?
Based on recent projections, we expect that the economy slightly increased last year, which technically means that we got out of recession.
We planned the recovery of economy and acceleration of growth in the forthcoming medium-term period, however there are still risks and uncertain dynamics. 
Potential growth rates of our economy are over 4% and that is medium-term framework that we should move towards to.
The similar situation is at global level; there is an increasing trend in majority of countries, markets are opened, growth in prices of shares and other risk assets shows that investors expect recovery.
 However, fiscal stimuli and low interest rates play significant part in current growth rates
It implies that new fall will not likely occur but the recovery will be slow during 2011 in Europe in general.  
In addition, a model for resolving European debt crisis has not been found yet and its consequences will follow us throughout the year. 
The hope remains that the investors will distinguish countries with good policies, primarily fiscal ones, which was the case in the last several months.
Can the solutions for so called soft landing be found, after great financial and economic crisis, by establishing adequate regulation and creating conditions for its full implementation?
When the economy was officially under recession, it was difficult to talk about so called soft landing.
We can talk about gradual recovery after the recession, which represents the grounds of our economic policy.
The basic scenario of growth projections in the forthcoming medium-term period comes from the forecasts that the recovery trend which has started in Q3 2011 will be continued with somewhat lower initial growth and higher rates in period 2012-2013.
This scenario anticipates moderate recovery, and economic growth of 2.5-4.0 percentages of realistic growth in period 2011-2013. 
It is based on the assumption that strong inflation growth is not expected, but its growth increased by 0.7% as compared to the projected one for Euro area, while it is below inflation rate projected for the economies of the Central and Eastern Europe in the same period.
Main contribution to the growth is expected in the services sector, mostly tourism and industrial production. 
There is also potential for growth in other sectors but there are also risks.
The stabilisation of banking sector, slight recovery of the banks’ lending activity and favourable impact of Eurobonds project and other credit facilities for public finances will represent the framework for strengthening investment activities.
Structural reforms in the education, health, social protection and state administration areas, as the basis for long-term systemic adjustments, will contribute to establishing sustainability of public finances, and new potential investments in energy, tourism, road and utility infrastructure should trigger the expected multiple effects.
As Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Montenegro, let me first say that we are honored that you have taken the time from your busy schedule to speak to our readers. 
The Balkans has been hit hard by the financial crisis. 
The psychology is down which leads to lower consumption, therefore lower production and hence we have the domino effect. 
As an economist, and someone who is very familiar with the region, what measures do you think the EU and the governments of this region should take to reverse the situation?
I think that the efforts of all governments in the past period were more or less focused on maintaining the financial and the real sector liquidity. 
Now we can say that the worst part of the crisis is behind us and that the world economy is entering a recovery stage.
This has been pronounced in the last IMF’s and the World Bank’s reports and by the second quarter indicators of the current year.
This does not mean that problems have been resolved. 
The crisis has left the consequences that the national economies will be struggling with for years. 
I think that the crisis was an important lesson for all and it enabled us in identifying the deficiencies of our economies and pursuing us in finding the long – term sustainable solutions. 
I believe that the solution to this should be found in the structural reforms area, improving the business environment and prudential fiscal policy, which will contribute to accelerated recovery of our economies, but also to a kind of a global economic system leveraging.
How has the economic climate affected Montenegro; is there light at the end of the tunnel?
The economic and the financial crises effects have strongly influenced the downward growth of Montenegrin economy. 
Our banking sector was hit the most and has suffered the biggest consequences, as well as aluminum and steel industries that had to undergo the necessary restructuring process. 
However, there are some encouraging indicators. 
Among them are the foreign direct investments that have increased by 30% in four months of the current year against the same period last year, the unemployment rate is rising, budgetary revenues for the first seven months of the current year are by 1,67% higher against the last year realization with the supporting structure being more sustainable in the long run. 
The measures of strong support aimed at initiating and recovering the industrial sector and optimization of the number of employees in large industrial systems, along with the implementation of economic – social programmes, have resulted in the increase in industrial production. 
We may say that the fall of Montenegrin economy was halted in the first half of the year. 
Furthermore, regardless of the fall in economy, being estimated at around 5,3% in the last year, this is however less than the growth recorded in 2008 of almost 7%. Economically speaking, many other countries have lost one or several years during 2009.
Needless to say, you have met with top investors, celebrities and business people throughout the world that have come to invest and enjoy Montenegro, can you tell our readers what inspired you to start a blog http://igorluksic.wordpress.com/?
I think this is a good model and a manner to provoke some new business ideas, exchange opinion and encourage entrepreneurs, investors, economic experts to become interested in Montenegro.
A new blog under the slogan "Straight Talk from the Heart of the Balkans" has been designed to animate the international professional and other public and, through a modern communication form, to present Montenegro as a modern European country that is interested in and that comm
Lord Byron saw the beauty of Montenegro and was truly inspired to write “At the moment of the creation of our planet, the most beautiful merging of land and sea occurred at the Montenegrin seaside... When the pearls of nature were sworn, an abundance of them were strewn all over this area..." 
From the top of Mt.Lovcen, Bernard Shaw exclaimed: "Am I in Paradise or on the Moon?!" 
And I am sure most of your tourists would agree with him, marking tourism as one of your top investment opportunities. 
Of course, with the crisis, tourism has been deeply afflicted, what is the outlook for tourism in the country this year and in the future?
Montenegrin exotic charms are known for centuries, but in today's global world they are becoming globally attractive. 
Definitely the tourism in the future period will be one of the main branch of economy, and tourism revenues will strongly balance the foreign trade account, generating the demand and economic growth in other sectors. 
We have planned that tourism revenues in 2010, will be the same as the last year.  
The latest indicators are showing that the visits in the last two months have exceeded the plan. 
I expect this trend to continue, and the measures taken by Montenegro in the field of improving hotel and tourist infrastructure, promotion and positioning on the world tourist map, to recognize and acknowledge Montenegro as an elite high-quality tourist destination.
Which industries or sectors, besides tourism, in Montenegro do you find most promising in terms of growth and sustainability?
The strategic commitment of the Government, which by its Economic Policy has defined the tourism, energy and agriculture as priorities in the economic development, has made us more interesting and attractive for investments. 
Apart from tourism, is of course, the energy sector being interesting for investments and further development of our economy, which Montenegro has recently made it open for investments. 
At the same time, this does not mean that the further development of certain forms of industrial production of aluminum and steel industry may not through reprocessing additionally influence the further economy diversification. 
The same statement stands for the wood processing and mining for example. 
It is the fact that Montenegro is a small country, but it has many resources that can be used to add value.
What specific opportunities are available at this time in the country or will be in the near future?
We are developing the rule of law state and we streamlining the procedures to create business friendly environment in which each area will be considered attractive and appealing to investors. 
I do not believe in economic engineering, but in instinct of an entrepreneur. 
State should be building institutions that will encourage this instinct.
Do you have any plans for additional incentives or reforms to benefit the investor or business communities?
Montenegro is a small attractive tourist destination which at its road to the EU has shown a political maturity, reflecting as well on economic development. 
By implementing the policy of maintaining stability in the previous period, large inflow of foreign direct investments, low taxes policies, we have positioned Montenegro on the list of the most competitive countries in Europe. 
Furthermore, we are actively working on eliminating the business barriers and improving the business environment, which is recognized in a number of international reports, primarily the Freedom House and Doing Business. 
By creating new business opportunities we are opening new jobs, thus creating conditions for increasing the living standards of our citizens.
Montenegro recently assumed the presidency of the South-East European Cooperation Process. 
What other roles would you like to see Montenegro playing in the Balkans?
Over a longer period of time, the international community has recognized Montenegro as a country which with its policy is contributing to the Europeanization of our region. 
Primarily, by contributing to the political stability, as well as the development of a tolerant society with a clear vision of the EU and NATO membership.
As the Chairman of such initiatives, such as cooperation process in Southeastern Europe, we will use our best endeavors in further expansion of these values and assisting in overcoming the regional problems.
Our readers are investors and business people who are already present or about to launch a business/investment in the region. What advice do you have for them?
The Western Balkans region has the greatest potential for economic growth in Europe.
I am more than certain. 
Montenegro belongs to the countries that are dedicated to creating the most favorable environment for investment and strengthening institutions, with equal opportunities for any investor.
On 23. of June. 2020, an online conference "Cooperation on VTMIS and Maritime Surveillance in the South Adriatic Area" was held as part of the SAGOV (South Adriatic Connectivity Governance) project.
The SAGOV project aims to achieve transport connections between Albania, Montenegro and Italy and is supported by the European Commission under the Interreg IPA CBC program, which includes these three countries. 
Beside Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs of the Government of Montenegro, the project is implemented by the Institute for Cooperation and Development from Tirana, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy of the Government of Albania, the European Movement in Montenegro and the Administration of the Pula Region from Italy. 
Representing the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs, Mrs. Emina Mujević Kara, Director General of the Directorate for International Cooperation and EU Funds, briefed the participants on the current situation in the transport sector and the progress made in the past.
Among other things, she pointed out that work is still being done on the implementation of projects from the Single Project Pipeline in the Transport Sector, with the aim of integration with the indicative extension of the TEN-T corridor to the Western Balkans in line with Connectivity agenda.
On behalf of the leading partner in the SAGOV project, the Institute for Cooperation and Development (CDI), Director Ardian Haçkaj addressed the audience and introduced the project, emphasizing that SAGOV promotes integrated management and more efficient decision-making regarding cross-border infrastructure connectivity. 
At the project level, SAGOV provides innovative solutions and procedures that can be used by all stakeholders in decision-making, in the preparation of joint projects and their implementation in the rest of the EUSAIR region.
The coordinator for international policies of the Region of Puglia, Claudio Polignano, also addressed the audience, emphasizing the importance of the project at the level of the Interreg IPA CBC program as well as the quality of the results achieved so far.
In the first part of the conference, the participants were addressed by the representative of the European Commission - DG MOVE Jakob Terling, Edmuns Beliskins from the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and Nedim Begovic on behalf of the Permanent Secretariat of the Transport Community to talk about success factors transport.
The second part of the conference was dedicated to the VTMIS system and the experiences of countries in the region when it comes to marine surveillance and control.  
This panel was attended by representatives from the Croatian Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure Zdravko Seidel, from the Slovenian Maritime Administration Captain Primoz Bajec and Captain Vladimir Vladovic, from the Albanian Maritime Directorate General Tomor Harizi, from the Italian Coast Guard Marko Tomaino and Nedzad Kapidani as a representative of the Maritime Safety Administration and port management of Montenegro.
The third and final part of the conference was based on current events and institutional knowledge transfer related to the VTMIS system and maritime surveillance. 
About the maritime traffic management system (eng.  Sea Traffic Management (STM) spoke Anders Johanneson of the Swedish Maritime Administration.  
Captain Joao Piedade from the National Maritime Administration of Portugal presented the COMPASS2020 project, from the Horizon 2020 program, which is implemented in cooperation with NATO and in which the Montenegrin Maritime Safety and Port Management Authority is a partner. 
Alkis Astjakopoulos spoke on behalf of the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection about the ANDROMEDA project, from the Horizon 2020 program, in which the Montenegrin Maritime Safety and Port Authority is also a partner, and a representative from the private sector from Italy, technical director of ELMAN srl, Pierluigi Flori spoke about MARE∑ system, implemented by his company for needs of EMSA.
After a dynamic discussion on maritime surveillance and protection systems initiated by the participants, the conference came to an end. 
It was concluded that the knowledge and experience presented by experts from the region and Europe as well as representatives of international organizations dealing with maritime transport will greatly facilitate the work on future projects.
On behalf of the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs of Montenegro and on his own behalf, the conference moderator and project manager Đorđije Otašević thanked to all participants with a wish for even better cooperation in this field.
According to the macroeconomic scenario, the Ministry of Finance predicted a cumulative real growth rate of Montenegrin gross domestic product (GDP) of 7.7 percent by 2021, while forecasting 2.8 percent for this year, said Minister Darko Radunović.
This forecast is based on a moderate projection of the growth rate of household consumption of 1.4 percent, government savings and growth of gross investment, which will be at a high level of about 1.7 billion euros," Radunovic said in an interview with Mina-business.
He said that the projections for this year must take into account some unfavorable announcements related to global economic developments that Montenegro cannot influence.
First of all, I mean the predictions of a slowdown in the growth of the economies of the European Union (EU), as well as the overall world economy, with the stabilization of crude oil prices on the world market and rising interest rates," Radunovic added.
According to him, these parameters are important for Montenegro in terms of managing its debts abroad, but also from the aspect of a possible more restrictive and cautious attitude towards investments.
In addition, we will continue to be in the cycle of started investments with a high starting level of parameters that determine the movement of GDP, and we must continue to apply financial consolidation measures and optimize public administration," said Radunovic.
When it comes to last year, he said that he was very satisfied that Montenegro achieved a much better economic result than expected.
Although the final data for the last quarter of last year are not available, in the first three quarters, we achieved serious growth rates, 4.5 percent, 4.9 percent, and five percent, respectively. 
Even with a restrictive estimate for the last three months of last year at the level of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent, we will have real GDP growth from 4.5 percent to 4.8 percent last year," Radunovic specified.
That, as he assessed, is an excellent result, even by European standards.
Radunović reminded that in the plans of the Ministry, the projection of GDP growth was 4.1 percent.
"Employment growth of 9.7 percent, induced primarily in the retail and construction sectors, but also in the manufacturing industry, is also gratifying. 
In November, we had almost 196 thousand employees, which is 17 thousand more than in the same period in 2017, "said Radunović.
Among other encouraging results, he mentioned the growth of gross investment, which, in nine months, amounted to 21.5 percent, which speaks of the intensity of the investment and development cycle in which Montenegro finds itself.
It should be noted that the achieved result was not accompanied by restrictive measures related to the standard of citizens, so the consumption of households grew significantly, 4.4 percent. 
At the same time, government spending grew at a rate almost three times lower, or 1.6 percent, "Radunovic added.
He stated that there is still an imbalance in foreign trade, although an increase in exports of as much as 8.6 percent was recorded.
When it comes to Montenegro's indebtedness this year, Radunovic said it would amount to 370m euros.
At the same time, slightly more, ie 373 million, will be the repayment of previous debts to foreign creditors. 
So, not only will there be no increase in the debt, but it will, it is true, not to a significant extent, decrease this year, "Radunović explained.
He added that a tranche of EUR 180 million is excluded from all this from the previously concluded arrangement with the Chinese Exim Bank, for the realization of the Bar-Boljare highway.
So, we remain on the principle of borrowing only in the context of repayment of previously incurred liabilities or for the purpose of capital development investment.
In addition, after a long time, we are entering the process of reducing the external debt, which is a long-term strategy of the Government, with the goal of reducing the total public debt below the level of 60 percent of GDP by 2022, "said Radunović.
When it comes to the tax debt, which amounts to 420 million EUR, Radunović believes that the Government must be encouraged by the fact that it has been reduced by 25 million for the year, and during the previous three-year period as much as 167 million.
In that context, the Law on Reprogramming of Tax Claims should be positively assessed, on the basis of which, in the first two years, a quarter of the total rescheduled tax debts were collected," Radunović specified.
He said that the issue remains in the focus of the Government's engagement in the coming period, through the consistent implementation of all segments of the Tax Debt Management Plan and the strengthening of collection measures.
It is also positive that the level of arrears on the basis of taxes and contributions on employees' salaries has a declining trend in recent years, especially if we keep in mind that these obligations have the largest share in the structure of tax debt. That speaks of increasing tax discipline ", claims Radunović.
He said that the consistent implementation of the law resulted in more than a thousand decisions to cancel the reprogram, in all cases when the debtor, for any reason, did not respect the obligations assumed by the reprogram.
With such a procedure, the total rescheduled debt, which has not been settled, is due for collection, so coercive measures are approached, including collateral provided for in the rescheduling. 
Where collection is not possible in any other way, bankruptcy proceedings are activated as the last available instrument of coercion, "said Radunović.
He reminded that the Tax Administration (TA), since the beginning of the application of the Law on Reprogramming of Tax Claims, has initiated bankruptcy proceedings against 42 tax debtors before the Commercial Court.
The same fate awaits all other debtors whose reprogram was revoked by a decision, if the collection of receivables cannot be done in any other way," warned Radunović.
He said that the Government, in relation to the current budget spending this year, plans to realize a revenue surplus of 197 million EUR.
Radunović reminded that this type of surplus in the amount of almost EUR 140 million was realized last year as well.
The continuation of that trend in the coming years will be a confirmation of the continuous fiscal recovery." 
I am confident that we will make it happen. 
However, in addition to current budget spending, there are also capital expenditures from the budget that will amount to EUR 321 million this year, "said Radunovic.
This surplus in relation to current budget spending will not be enough to neutralize the complete budget deficit, so that this year it will amount to 2.97 percent of GDP, or 147 million EUR in absolute terms.
As for the Bar-Boljare highway, Radunovic said that the government had set aside 220m euros from the budget for this year to finance the project, which is part of the capital budget, which this year is the largest since Montenegro's statehood restoration.
This year, the government plans to borrow on the domestic market by offering securities to citizens at a certain interest rate.
Radunović said that the Ministry pays exceptional attention to optimizing borrowing, ie the quality of debt from the aspect of more favorable maturity and more favorable borrowing prices.
On the other hand, the impression is that the financial market of Montenegro is ripe for the activation of new financial instruments, ie new types of securities. 
Due to both mentioned factors, we are considering the possibility of issuing bonds of different maturities intended for domestic individuals or companies, "said Radunović.
He believes that this would be a good model for activating the now inactive capital, especially in the situation of low interest rates offered by the banking sector to the roles of citizens and the economy.
Although it will be the subject of detailed analysis, according to the current circumstances, the interest on such bonds could average around three percent," Radunovic specified, adding that he believes in the success of domestic bonds, which will be proof of high trust of citizens and companies in their own country. .
He announced that the possibility of changing conditions will be incorporated into the project of issuing domestic bonds, considering the economic and political developments at the international level.
This type of security must also be competitive and attractive to the buyer, otherwise the market will reject it," Radunović concluded
In order to strengthen accountability and transparency in public financial management, a new information portal has been developed that will provide citizens with easier insight into the financial data of local governments in Montenegro. 
The new portal, which is available at the web address https://lokalnefinansije.me, will contribute to bridging the information gap that often exists between citizens and local governments, when it comes to local public finances.
The portal, developed in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance of Montenegro and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) office, with the support of the Slovak Ministry of Finance, will contribute to improving transparency in public financial management at the local level and serve as a platform for monitoring local budgets. Montenegro.
Inviting Montenegrin citizens to visit the new portal, UNDP Resident Representative in Montenegro Daniela Gasparikova said that "UNDP believes that this portal will contribute to more transparent and responsible management of public finances in Montenegro." 
I also hope that it will help citizens, civil society organizations and all stakeholders to exercise their right of insight into the monitoring, planning, budgeting and execution of public finances at the local level.
I expect that this important undertaking will open space for a constructive and open dialogue between institutions and citizens on economic and social priorities, which these budgets should support. 
The portal is part of the broader support provided by the Government of the Slovak Republic in terms of improving public financial management in Montenegro, "said Gasparikova.
N J. E. The Ambassador of the Slovak Republic to Montenegro, Boris Gandel, is very pleased that the project, funded by the Slovak Republic, contributes to improving transparency and accountability in the management of public finances in Montenegro. 
For Ambassador Gandel, that is another proof of our sincere friendship and partnership, and Slovakia has been supporting Montenegro since the restoration of its statehood. 
In my country, after the "Plush Revolution", we did a lot to transform Slovakia into a modern democratic society. 
Transparency was one of the basic principles of this process. 
The existence of clear rules and the possibility of controlling their implementation - are mandatory in this regard. 
This applies to all spheres of life - including finances. 
We appreciate the efforts of all parties involved and I am proud that the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic, together with Slovakia, has contributed to the implementation of this project. 
Since transparency is one of the basic principles of the European Union, let me congratulate Montenegro on this path that has taken another step towards its European future," Gandel concluded.
As a new tool, the portal will enable timely communication of data in a way that is accessible and relevant to citizens interested in public finances at the local level. 
Financial stability and sustainability of local governments, as one of the main priorities of the Ministry of Finance, is a key prerequisite for better quality of services and the overall perspective of economic development.
Director General of the Directorate for Local Self-Government and State-Owned Companies in the Ministry of Finance, Snezana Mugosa, pointed out that "the portal is a project of visualization of budget data of local finances in Montenegro, and was done to improve transparency of public finances at the local level." 
Namely, all local self-government units are obliged to report monthly to the Ministry of Finance, as well as to publish their quarterly reports on their websites. 
This portal unites all the data that are available in one place, and they are presented in a simple and visually acceptable way ", concluded Mugoša.
The portal provides an overview of aggregate data at the level of all municipalities in Montenegro, which includes receipts, expenditures, outstanding liabilities and debts from 2009 to 2019.
In addition, a detailed comparative overview of data at the level of all municipalities in Montenegro is given, which includes individual budget items for the same period.
The portal was developed through the UNDP project Strengthening Transparent and Responsible Public Financial Management in Montenegro, and the data published on the portal will be updated annually.
At today's session, the Government of Montenegro adopted the Spring Analysis of Macroeconomic Trends and Structural Reforms - 2019.
"The Montenegrin economy in 2017 and 2018 is characterized by strong economic growth rates of 4.7 and 4.9% in 2017 and 2018, and thus Montenegro was one of the fastest growing economies in the Western Balkans and among the fastest growing. economies of the European Union ", said the Director General of the Directorate for Economic and Development Policy in the Ministry of Finance, Iva Vukovic, MA, at a press conference after the Government session.
The biggest positive contribution to economic growth in 2018 came from increased investment activity as well as increased household consumption. 
Increased investment activity is the result of private investments predominantly in the tourism and energy sectors, while public investments also give their contribution through increased investment activity on the construction of highways, but also other local and regional roads, "said General Manager Vukovic.
The largest contribution of investments to real GDP growth was 4%, while the second largest contribution comes from household consumption of 3.4 percentage points. and it is the result of a record tourist season, growth in lending activity, growth in remittances and employment growth.
Revenues from tourism in 2018 exceeded one billion euros, we had twice the export of electricity, increased exports of aluminum and increased exports of pharmaceutical production, but all this was not enough to neutralize high imports predominantly for the construction of investment projects and thus the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth was negative 2.1 pp, "said Director General Vukovic, adding that Montenegro is at 47% of the EU average, according to Eurostat (regional comparison of GDP per capita as the EU average according to purchasing power standard for 2018, the first Eurostat estimate), followed by Serbia, Northern Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina with a lower average development compared to EU countries.
Monstat announced in the first quarter that the growth rate of the economy was at the level of 3%, and observed by macroeconomic indicators, a diverse situation can be seen depending on the sector. 
We have sectors that recorded extremely strong growth rates in the first quarter, while there are also sectors that due to objective circumstances recorded a decline. 
Thus, the sectors that recorded extremely strong growth in the first quarter: the tourism sector with 44.1% more arrivals and 22.5% more tourist nights and this may be a signal or indicator of another record tourist year.
Retail turnover increased by 6.2% at current prices and 5.5% at constant prices and represents the strongest retail growth since 2013.
The value of construction put in place increased by 12.4% and it is expected that significant growth in construction will be in the second half of the year, taking into account numerous investment activities in the country.
Industrial production fell by 14.4% due to a drop in electricity production. 
The small amount of precipitation affected the reduced production of the hydro power plant, while the thermal power plant recorded an increase of 6.7% compared to the previous year, and wind power plants in the observed period accounted for 10% of total electricity production.
Labor market indicators in the observed period recorded extremely positive trends as a continuation of the trends from 2018. 
Also, this year is characterized by a slight increase in consumer prices of 0.5% on average and it is expected that prices in the coming period will be influenced by prices from the international market, under the influence of oil prices and the ratio of euro and dollar.
The labor market activity rate according to the Labor Force Survey is higher by 1.5 percentage points. or 55.2% and this represents a record level of activity in the labor market. 
We also have a record low unemployment rate of 15% and a record employment rate of 47.5% at the end of 2018.
The current account deficit continued to grow by 4.6% in the first quarter due to a deterioration in the balance of goods and services and a decline in the primary income surplus. 
The central budget deficit at the end of the first quarter was EUR 71.4 million or 1.5% of GDP, as a result of fiscal policy and fiscal consolidation measures.
In 2018, we had a current budget surplus of 152 million euros or 3.3% of GDP, the level of results when reduced by the cost of results of development projects and is an indicator of the effectiveness of fiscal policy pursued in the previous period.
For the next period, it is necessary to continue with the implementation of structural reforms, which are a necessary precondition for sustainable economic growth, strengthening the competitiveness of the domestic economy and achieving the strategic goals of our economy," concluded General Manager Vukovic.
The Government of Montenegro is successfully servicing all its obligations, so there is no indication or fear of possible bankruptcy - Minister of Finance Darko Radunović told Portal Analitika. 
He also said that the results on budget revenues and expenditures since the beginning of the year are encouraging.
Radunović pointed out that the Government, depending on the result of the remedial measures, will decide whether to enter into an arrangement with the World Bank (WB) in order to provide part of the funds for 2018 and 2019. 
Radunović says that they are not thinking about an arrangement with the IMF at this moment.
The Minister of Finance emphasized that there is room for increasing certain tax rates, for example on cigarettes, alcoholic and carbonated drinks
He added that they are considering the possibility of introducing two lower VAT rates instead of the current one.
Under this model, the current VAT rate on basic products for human consumption would be further reduced, while the tax rate on other products to which a single lower rate is now applied would be increased.
Data on budget revenues in the first quarter of this year (EUR 297.5 million) and expenditures in January and February (EUR 208.1) are, to put it mildly, encouraging.
They represent the first visible effect of a policy of consolidating public finances.
Namely, revenues are 4.5 percent (12.7 million euros) higher compared to the same period in 2016, which is largely the result of an increase in the excise tax on mineral oils, but also the initial strengthening of tax discipline.
On the other hand, the costs are as much as 58.8 million euros, or 22.6 percent lower than planned for the first two months. 
True, some obligations that we settled in the first two months last year, this year fall due in March, for which we do not yet have complete data, but the costs will certainly be lower.
The public is aware that, in addition to the adoption of the budget for the current year, we have defined the Plan of Rehabilitation Measures as the basis for the consolidation of public finances, which is an elementary assumption of financial stability of the state, and therefore economic development of Montenegro.
According to our estimates, the monetary quantification of the implementation of this Plan amounts to 126.9 million euros, which represents 3.2 percent of the projected GDP. 
This information speaks volumes about the importance of the recovery plan. 
Moreover, in projecting the results of the implementation of the Plan, we have applied conservative methods of assessing expectations, so it is very possible that the result will be even better.
The plan includes conventional but vigorously implemented mechanisms to increase budget revenues through more efficient collection of tax receivables, as well as zero tolerance in relation to the gray economy. 
However, it is also important that the Plan envisages stimulating economic and financial models that should, through the optimization of the business environment, influence growth and development, and that indirectly means the generation of new fiscal sources.
 In addition, it should be expected that, even independently of the recovery plan, the intensification of the investment cycle, especially in the strategic sectors of development of our economy, will bring an increase in newly created value and job creation. 
The overall result of such a trend will be visible through improved living standards of citizens, which is the main goal of the Government in the economic sphere. 
At the same time, in relation to the expenditure side of the budget, the Plan Of course.
It is too early to talk about success in achieving the full effects of the Plan, but the first results are already visible, which I illustrated in the answer to the previous question.
Amendments to the Law on Public Sector Wages will not bring new savings. 
Namely, the optimization that we planned through the suspension of compensation for past work starting in April this year, was replaced by a reduction of all higher salaries. 
The cumulative effect of this reduction, which has already been materialized by the Budget Law for 2017, amounts to 2.8 million euros, which is close to the effect we would get by suspending past work. 
Given the financial equivalence of the savings brought by these two mechanisms, we decided to reduce higher wages, estimating that it is logically more consistent, from a social point of view. 
Do you plan to borrow in the second quarter by issuing bonds, or in some other way, and in what amount
However, the Ministry of Public Administration, not the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for this assessment and the resulting actions.
The Ministry of Finance is negotiating with financial institutions on possible credit arrangements, because our plan is to realize all the needs of borrowing to finance the budget in the first half of the year. 
After the end of the negotiations, the possible creditors, the scope and conditions of borrowing will be known, based on which we will see if there is a need to provide other sources of financing, such as issuing bonds on the domestic market.
It is understood that we will treat the effects of this entire procedure transparently, ie that the public will be informed about them in a timely manner.
Even in countries that do not have problems financing public spending, the fiscal system should be constantly subject to possible optimization, in a way that will not jeopardize its predictability and stability. 
Given the need to remedy the budget deficit and reduce public debt, we obviously have additional reasons to monitor and improve our fiscal mechanisms. 
Therefore, the Ministry of Finance is preparing a Fiscal Strategy that will identify measures that, in the medium term, should ensure the stability and sustainability of public finances, while creating conditions for increasing the investment capacity of the state. 
The Government's determination is that all fiscal changes must be dimensioned standard of citizens and to have a positive impact on economic activity.
Even with these restrictions, there is room to increase certain tax rates. 
For example, I will mention excise duties on products that are not of existential importance for citizens, and even pose a health risk, such as cigarettes, alcoholic and carbonated beverages.
We are also considering the possibility of introducing two lower VAT rates instead of the current one. 
Under this model, the current VAT rate on basic products for human consumption would be further reduced, while the tax rate on other products would be increased, to which a single lower rate now applies. 
One of the options that we consider realistic and rational is to increase the real estate tax, which represents a surplus of housing, ie secondary housing. 
The subject of fiscal analysis and possible changes will be all exemptions, ie tax exemptions introduced by previous regulations.
Changes to the tax system must be in line with European legislation. 
On the other hand, we must preserve, and even improve, the current level of competitiveness of our fiscal system in relation to other countries in the region, in order to maintain a strong position in attracting foreign investment.
The Government of Montenegro is successfully servicing all its obligations, so there are no indications or fears of possible bankruptcy.
Those who base their thesis on bankruptcy on the quantification of Montenegro's public debt refer to a comparative analysis with other countries in the region, as well as the degree of indebtedness of the world's leading economies. 
We want the already visible effects of fiscal consolidation to be a sustainable global economic impulse. 
In this context, we have intensive talks with the World Bank, with whose experts we analyze all aspects of budget optimization, in order to achieve a surplus in the short term. 
Success in the implementation of remedial measures that would reduce the deficit may be a prerequisite for concluding a credit or guarantee arrangement with the World Bank that would allow us to provide funds to finance the budgets for 2018 and 2019. 
Although at this time the Government of Montenegro does not plan to enter In a formal arrangement with the International Monetary Fund that shows interest in this, we should emphasize that we attach great importance to cooperation with this important financial institution. 
In any case, our fiscal policy planning is based on the need to preserve living standards, with special sensitivity to the poorest. 
In addition, we will certainly insist on the continuity of the development function of the budget, as a basis for achieving higher rates of economic growth.
Tolerance of non-payment of tax obligations can be allowed only if it prevents some major economic damage to the state. 
Only this type of selectivity can, in certain circumstances, be considered justified, provided that it is transparent and does not affect market equality. 
Any other "concession" in this domain is harmful to the state and, of course, illegal, and as such should be prosecuted. 
In that sense, I believe that the accumulation of this tax debt was significantly influenced by numerous objective circumstances, which face all tax administrations and economies in the region.
A large part of the receivables is decades old and comes from companies that were once economic giants with a specific economic position, which influenced the tolerance of non-payment of obligations to the state. 
Many of these companies did not survive the transition, so they were left with debts, not only on the tax basis, but also to business partners, and even to employees. 
Tax debt management, therefore, is not a trivial issue of coercion, because bare coercion can jeopardize the survival of an economic entity.
The disappearance of any business entity produces job losses and other indirect damages.
Therefore, in addition to the obligatory protection of market equality, the totality of economic interests of the state and the principle that optimization of budget revenues, with clear tax discipline, should result from expanding the tax base, and not from closing down economic entities and reducing economic activity.
This should by no means be understood as the state's readiness for linear tolerance in relation to taxpayers.
But only as the need for increased attention in considering each individual problem case.
Interest is also calculated on evidently uncollectible receivables, which additionally burdens tax accounting and complicates tax debt management. 
Finally, in every business, even in the process of tax collection, it must be taken into account that a part of the receivables will remain uncollectible, regardless of the degree of tax discipline and the mechanisms applied by the state in tax collection. 
The figure of 567 million euros of tax debt is certainly large, especially for economies of our rank. 
However, if we keep in mind that this debt arose in a period of several decades, and that we collected 935.6 million in tax revenues in 2016 alone, it is possible that we will alleviate the perception of the mentioned tax dubiousness. 
With all these facts in mind, it is important for us to approach the solution of this problem with full seriousness, not neglecting a single euro, but also extremely realistic, aware of the fact that a good part of the receivables is absolutely uncollectible.
Tax accounting, therefore, should be "cleaned up" following the necessity of non-collection, and the remaining part should be collected through realistic and sustainable mechanisms that will be provided by law.
The line Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare has taken over the coordination of tasks related to redefining the overall policy of social benefits in order to create a greater degree of fairness in the distribution of this type of state aid, as well as creating a financially sustainable social assistance system. 
Sensitive attitude towards the most vulnerable social categories of society, provide adequate protection for all beneficiaries of these benefits. 
When it comes to the popularly called Law on Mothers, our message has always been that we will not neglect any woman who received the right to compensation We will put in a special position those mothers who left their jobs for the mentioned compensation.
However, we have the responsibility of ensuring the functioning of the public finance system, which is why we defined in the Budget Law for 2017 that benefits on this basis are paid by the end in reduced amounts, which is legally justified The decision was supported by the Constitutional Court. 
The overall policy of social benefits is within the competence of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
This policy must be redefined periodically, in order to control, within the real possibilities of the state, the respect of the principle of fairness in the distribution of state aid. 
With the new legal solutions, the Government especially tries to pragmatize the sensitive attitude towards the most vulnerable social categories of society, ie to provide the maximum possible protection to all beneficiaries of this type of assistance. 
Which, on this basis, has acquired the right to compensation and will put in a special position those mothers who, on the basis of indirect "suggestions" of this Law, left their jobs for the mentioned compensation.
There is no doubt that it would have been much easier for this Government if it had not been forced to reduce the allowances for mothers.
However, the Government must, with full responsibility, treat the overall obligations implied by the public finance system. 
From that totality, an assessment was made that the previous level of benefits under the Law on Mothers is unsustainable if other social benefits are not abolished or reduced. 
Therefore, with the Budget Law, we foresaw this change, aware of its unpopularity, but also convinced of its necessity. 
periodically review the possibility of increasing all social benefits, including the allowances to mothers, in the context of the results of the consolidation of public finances and the expected GDP growth.
The deficit of the Health Fund is evident, but it is not the only cost category of the state in which the original revenues do not cover the costs.
Such "minuses" are still, to a large extent, solved by transfers from the budget. 
Linking precisely defined, ie predefined budget revenues with specific cost categories would, I am convinced, disrupt the system of centralized management of state finances as the only possible budget management mechanism if we want optimal treatment of costs. priority. 
In addition, such a principle of remediation of the deficit would not stimulate the user (in this case - the Health Fund) to rationalize their own business and, over time, balance their expenses with their original income, which, in my opinion, is more than a necessary financial strategy.
As in all world economies, in Montenegro, due to the economic and financial crisis, the liquidity of the financial and real sector was endangered. 
The Montenegrin government responded to the crisis promptly and in a timely manner and adopted a very fragmented anti-crisis package. 
From this distance, I think we did everything right, listening carefully to the needs of the financial and real sectors, which contributed to confronting the liquidity of these two systems.
 On the other hand, this package was accompanied by other measures to stabilize public finances, which, among other things, included control and reduction of spending, stopping new employment, saving on the discretionary spending, which resulted in a reduction of spending by about 9% percentage points GDP in the period 2008-2010. years. 
The essence of our approach was that we did not only deal with the liquidity of the system (which remains a challenge), but we also launched a series of structural reforms that should make the economic system more resistant to crisis shocks in the long run.
Technically, the Montenegrin economy has already emerged from recession, and according to our projections, we expect growth of 0.5% by the end of 2010. 
Next year is the year of recovery of our economy.
In this regard, the budget for next year, we planned real economic growth of 2.5%, and in accordance with the practice we introduced in previous years, and supported by the European Commission, as a responsible government, we have developed an alternative positive and negative scenario of 3 .5% and 0.5% of real GDP growth, respectively. 
Economic growth in 2011 is based on the expectation of additional consolidation of the banking system, growth of activities in the real sector and a high level of foreign direct investment, which in 2011 is planned at the level of about 550 mil. €.
In 2011, we will continue activities aimed at regulatory reform and improving the business environment. 
We will continue structural reforms in the field of public services, but also launch a new cycle of public administration reform.
We will implement measures to strengthen the activities of small and medium enterprises and maintain production in large industrial systems.
The goal is to restore the employment growth trend.
In the coming period, I expect further implementation of transport infrastructure projects, projects in the field of energy and valorization of tourist sites, as well as the implementation of infrastructure projects of local and regional character, which will contribute to opening new opportunities for our citizens and improving quality of life.
In the coming years, we expect the recovery of our economy with the dynamization of economic growth and the reduction of the problem of illiquidity of the economy and the strengthening of the competitiveness of our economy. 
The main drivers will be, first of all, the start of revival processes, good interest of foreign investors, successfully implemented Eurobond project, increase of banks' lending activity, support to the real sector. 
The carriers of economic growth will be tourism, the energy sector and agriculture. A stable political framework and progress in Euro-Atlantic integration will significantly help.
Montenegro is a small and open economy. 
On the one hand, that is positive, because one small investment can do a lot for the further development of our economy.
On the other hand, as the economic and financial crisis has shown, open economies are more sensitive to external influences. 
Certainly, we are aware of these threats, but in the years of disturbed economic conditions, we have shown that we know how to manage the situation.
What is positive news is that all neighboring countries are coming out of the recession, which is, of course, a favorable external environment for our economy as well.
It is certainly one of the most important economic "events" this year.
It was not just borrowing, as it is sometimes presented, it was an event that opened the door to the whole of Montenegro to European capital markets and confirmed that investors have confidence in our public finances. 
The importance of the show itself is also evidenced by the recent assessments of the IMF leaders that this is positive news for the entire region.
We were not forced to enter into an emergency stand by arrangement with the IMF, as countries in the region, we independently pursued a policy of reducing public spending and stabilizing public finances. reflected our good investor rating.
I think that the fact that we provided money on the capital market speaks for itself.
At the proposal of the Council for Regulatory Reform and Improvement of the Business Environment, which I chair, the Government of Montenegro adopted the Action Plan for Regulatory Reform and Improvement of the Business Environment. 
This document combines three pillars of reforms: Regulatory Reform "Guillotine" of Regulations, Ease of Doing Business Reform and Regulatory Effects Assessment (RIA), which will be implemented by the Government in cooperation with the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). 
Our goal is to create Montenegro as an attractive business destination with low tax rates. 
To this end, in the previous period, through the activities of the Council, the business environment was further improved by reducing and equalizing the personal income tax rate for all categories of income, to 9%, including entrepreneurs.
At the same time, the obligation of monthly advance payment of corporate income tax was abolished, contribution rates paid at the expense of the employer were reduced, and thus employers were relieved of the part of financial costs they have based on hiring labor.
Activities are underway to change the legal regulations on the financing of local self-governments.
In the previous period, the Law on Improving the Business Environment was adopted, prepared by the Ministry of Finance, which changes the provisions of ten other laws, all in the direction of shortening deadlines, reducing the number of procedures and reducing taxes and other burdens on business.
improvement of "business" regulations. Our efforts were recently recognized in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report, according to which Montenegro recorded 3 reforms, which ranks it among the 21 countries that have made so many reforms, and only 8 countries have implemented more reforms than our country. 
At the same time, we are the only country in the region that has implemented 3 reforms, which indicates that we have implemented the most reforms in the region.
The Council for Regulatory Reform and Improvement of the Business Environment has identified priority areas for the coming period, which relate to the establishment of a single counter for company registration, finalization of the reform of company licensing procedures, adoption of the Law on Enforcement Procedure, further simplification of procedures for employment of foreigners. collection of taxes and contributions, reduction of administrative fees, expansion of the scope of the credit register, as well as improvement of property registration.
So, we will deal with those indicators where we are still dissatisfied with the rating. 
Activities within the Regulatory Reform Project are being carried out continuously, which are being implemented in cooperation with the International Finance Corporation, and which include the Guillotine of Regulations and the introduction of regulatory impact analysis in the Montenegrin system, ie Regulatory Impact Assessment.
RIA includes a systematic analysis of the impact of regulation on the system as a whole, enhances the dialogue between the private and public sectors in the design of regulations, and increases the level of awareness of decision makers about the implications of regulations.
These and other activities we undertake should make Montenegro and the Montenegrin economy more competitive and dynamic. 
Ultimately, this joint work should result in the opening of new businesses, improved operations of existing ones, new employment and a rise in living standards.
Every government wants to see as many investors in its country as possible. 
Especially in the period after the crisis, the further sequence of events will be interesting.
I think that in the previous period we have shown that we are a country that protects investors, as shown by the recent World Bank report on ease of doing business, according to which Montenegro is in 28th place out of 183 observed countries in terms of investor protection further improving the business environment. 
However, other reports, such as the UN on the quality of life or the World Economic Forum on competitiveness, suggest the attractiveness of investing in our country. 
Our advantages compared to other countries are the lowest tax rates and single-digit taxes, favorable business environment, free flow of capital and goods, therefore, all the prerequisites that are important for a single investor. 
I think this is the best recommendation to investors. FDI will continue to be key to accelerated economic development.
Montenegro is committed to European integration, which is confirmed by obtaining an opinion on the status of candidate for membership. 
The big deal is behind us, and certainly even bigger ahead of us. 
We are expected to receive the date of negotiations for membership and in that body a great engagement of our administration in the part of opening and closing negotiation chapters.
Not an easy task for our administration, but I believe that in the integrations so far we have shown that our administration is ready for this great job.
Shortly after gaining independence, Montenegro has established extremely successful cooperation with almost all relevant international financial institutions. 
In this regard, the cooperation with development banks (WB, EBRD, EIB and KfW) is particularly noteworthy, which have so far invested a significant amount of funds in Montenegro for the implementation of development projects, mostly in the field of energy, transport, water supply and wastewater disposal, then the banking sector, and the development of small and medium enterprises. 
 Even Montenegro was an innovator in some projects during the crisis, such as is, for example, support to the banking sector and small and medium-sized enterprises through the EIB.
It is to be expected that the cooperation with development banks, which can be said to be based on solid foundations of mutual trust and positive experience so far, will continue in the future. 
The budget for 2011 plans funds for the implementation of several projects. 
When it comes to cooperation with the IMF, it should be emphasized that Montenegro maintains regular communication with this institution, which is reflected in the ongoing exchange of data and projections.
As a country on the way to the EU and NATO, recognized as an attractive business destination, where a large number of companies are open and where investments are made such as highways, Lustica, Porto Montenegro, hydroelectric power plants, submarine cable with Italy, etc., with great opportunities for employment, better salaries and standards of our citizens and, of course, better budget revenues, which is to contribute to the increase of funds for the improvement of infrastructure and other services of importance to our citizens.
This is the year of the mini-boom of the Montenegrin economy and indicates that the real GDP growth will eventually amount to four percent. 
Confirmations that we are on the right path these days are also coming from the international partners of the World Bank, the IMF and the European Commission. 
In order to ensure continuity of growth and amortize risks, we are working intensively on changing the structure of the economy, in order to reduce import dependence and encourage exports, we will keep competitive tax rates ... said Iva Vukovic, Director General of the Directorate for Economic Policy and Development in the Ministry. finance, presenting the Proposal of projections of macroeconomic and fiscal indicators from this to 2020, which was adopted by the Government five days ago.
In the current year, the government has determined measures to achieve the stability of public finances in the medium term and is not considering the introduction of new austerity measures. 
The budget deficit will be continuously reduced in the coming period and from 2020 it will move to a surplus zone, which will amount to 4.5 percent of GDP. From 2019, the trend of reducing the share of public debt in GDP will be established, so that in 2020 it will amount to 67 percent and will be lower by seven percentage points compared to 2019.
 I would like to point out that the Government decided to determine measures to consolidate public finances.
This week, the government supported the budget proposal for 2018, which on the one hand guarantees consistency in the implementation of fiscal consolidation measures, and on the other hand contributes to increasing competitiveness and economic development.
The economy recorded results in the first half of the year that were significantly higher than expected.
Real GDP growth of 4.2 percent was achieved. The dynamization of economic growth is encouraged by the more intensive implementation of works on the construction of major infrastructure projects, especially on the construction of highways, local infrastructure and tourist facilities, as well as another record tourist season, which is reflected, among other things, in the significant growth of traffic in tourism. 
All this has resulted in positive trends, among other things, in the labor market with the growth of employment and wages, along with the reduction of unemployment. 
Achieved results, as well as estimated gross investment of about 23 percent of GDP and the expected effects of the tourist season with 950 million euros indicate that real GDP growth at the end of 2017 will be four percent, which creates a sense of satisfaction and encourages even more decisive and we will contribute faster to economic development in the coming period.
There is a high degree of harmonization of domestic and external economic assessments of the World Bank, the European Commission, the IMF. 
The exception is the assessment of the IMF for 2017, which has not yet revised the spring projections for Montenegro, which was confirmed to us by their representatives, whose mission is in Montenegro.
 The Government's efforts in the field of economic policy were also recognized in the reports of credit rating agencies that improved the "prospects for Montenegro." .
With the expected real GDP growth in 2018 of three percent, the Montenegrin economy will gradually begin to approach potential GDP. 
Growth is based on large investment projects in strategic sectors of our economy. 
Household consumption will grow, as will gross investment, and will have the highest yield to real growth.
Further employment growth is expected. 
At the same time, I would like to point out that the revenues from tourism will exceed one billion euros, which is the result of the combined effect of the extended duration of the tourist season, expanding the offer through putting new capacities into operation and consequently increasing tourist visits.
Established fiscal consolidation measures that achieve the goal of fiscal policy of the Government of Montenegro, ie establish the sustainability of public finances, ie the transition from deficit to the budget surplus zone from2020. year and the establishment of a downward trend in public debt from 2019, in the first year of implementation are already giving positive results. 
Namely, the realized budget revenues for the nine months of 2017 amounted to 1.116 billion euros and are higher both in relation to the plan and in relation to the comparable period of 2016, by 1.3 million euros, or 32.9 million. 
Also, budget expenditures were lower than planned by 100 million or 7.6 percent, and in nine months amounted to 1.218 billion. 
As a result of these developments, the budget deficit amounted to 102.6 million, with the largest part, ie 98.5 percent or 101.1 million euros, related to capital expenditures, while current expenditures were financed from source revenues. 
It is estimated that, having in mind the overall economic results, in 2017 the budget deficit will be at the level of 3.7 percent of GDP, which is 33 percent lower than the plan for this year. M.PM.
The model of growth of our economy, to the greatest extent, is based on investments, more and more intensive work is being done on diversification of the economy, ie on changing its structure, in order to reduce import dependence and encourage exports.
The only way to ensure the sustainability of public debt is faster economic growth. 
Thanks primarily to investment in capital projects, which will affect the dynamization of economic activity, it is expected that in the next three years there will be faster economic growth. 
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, the realization of projects of 100 million euros would lead to a GDP growth of 1.7 to two percent.
Since GDP is the denominator of the amount of indebtedness, the level of public debt automatically decreases when GDP grows, Žugić points out
Investments in highway construction and other public works will increase the deficit, and it is important to note that the planned capital investments have a distinctly developmental character and create preconditions for stronger economic growth and development, thus contributing to an increase in the absolute level of GDP. 
The increase in the absolute expression of GDP further leads to a reduction in the relative amounts of deficit and public debt and creates a material basis for reducing the absolute amounts of these two most important fiscal parameters, said Minister of Finance Dr. Radoje Zugic in an interview with Portal Analitika.
The budget for 2015 has a distinctly development component, which is best evidenced by a significant increase in the capital budget, which will, mainly due to the construction of the highway, amount to 284 million euros, which is about eight percent of GDP. 
The capital, as well as the total budget for the next year, is designed by reducing the share of consumption that does not have a predominantly developmental character, ie this element is redirected to the segment that is in the function of creating new value, ie dynamizing overall economic growth.
On the other hand, other expenditure items are mostly reduced, primarily the so-called discretionary expenses, such as business travel expenses, which have been reduced by about 1.5 million compared to this year, "Zugic explained.
The main goal of the fiscal policy that we create and implement, he pointed out, is to achieve budget balance.
It strengthens the prospects for economic growth and development and is a prerequisite for the successful and lasting remediation of all structural problems that characterize our fiscal and economic system.
We are successfully approaching the establishment of the budget balance through a continuous reduction of the deficit, which in 2012 was planned at 3.3 percent of GDP, in 2013 2.7 percent, and in 2014 1.98 percent, while the deficit is for the next year, it is projected in the level of 0.8 percent of GDP, if the expenses related to the beginning of the realization of the highway are excluded ", emphasized Minister Žugić.
Due to the maturity of the obligations to repay Eurobonds issued in 2010, the debt repayment item will be significantly increased in 2015. 
Therefore, borrowing of EUR 634.1 million will be necessary, of which EUR 398.3 million relates to debt repayment, EUR 206 million to highway expenditures, and the remaining EUR 29.8 million to cover the budget deficit, which is decreasing from year to year.
In addition to the process of fiscal adjustment, in the coming year we will intensively deal with the restructuring of public debt, by replacing more expensive loans with cheaper ones as much as possible, and thus reduce interest costs.
Having in mind the importance and role of public debt in the Montenegrin economy, the achieved limits and the forthcoming maturity of obligations in the field of public debt of Montenegro, we focused on defining and implementing measures related to improving the competitiveness of our economy and creating a stimulating environment for GDP growth. and which will contribute to strengthening fiscal positions and ensure the sustainability of public debt.
Namely, the only way to ensure the sustainability of public debt is faster and more dynamic economic growth. 
Thanks primarily to investment in capital projects, both state and foreign investors, which will significantly affect the dynamization of economic activity, are expected to in the period 2015-2018. years to achieve faster growth of the Montenegrin economy. 
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, the realization of investment projects worth 100 million euros would have a positive effect on the GDP growth rate of 1.7 to two percent. 
Since GDP is the denominator of the amount of indebtedness, the level of public debt automatically decreases when GDP grows, which is the way to establish its sustainability.
If we keep in mind that 1.09 billion euros were earned in ten months of this year, which is 6.4 percent more than planned and 10 percent more compared to the same period last year, in which we made a very significant step forward in collection of budget revenues compared to the previous period, then we can say that we are very satisfied with the results of work in this segment.
The growth of collected revenues is the result of 1) a significant decrease in the volume of the gray economy, 2) a slight increase in economic activity, which, unfortunately, so far this year has not been achieved at the projected level, which is due, among other things, to unfavorable weather conditions. and the deflationary price trend) and 3) implemented fiscal consolidation measures.
The State Audit Institution gave a positive opinion on the draft law on the final account for last year. 
An audit reveals that the financial result is presented correctly and that the financial statements are true, objective and in accordance with accepted accounting standards.
The SAI stated that fiscal discipline has been improved, but that there is room for further strengthening, especially in the area of ​​harmonization of business activities of consumer units with the regulations governing budget operations.
This position is shared by the Ministry, so we pay full attention to improving internal financial control, both in terms of continuous expansion of the scope of internal audit, and in terms of strengthening all elements of financial management.
Within our competencies, given that the responsibility for lawful operations and spending of funds lies with the heads of bodies, we strive to influence more rational and efficient public spending and to reduce material, procedural and procedural deviations and errors.
The Ministry wants to affirm good cooperation with the SAI, whose recommendations we attach great importance to, treating them equally as legal obligations.
This project, which is based on the idea of ​​uniting citizens, academia, international partners and state institutions in the fight against the gray economy, has given extraordinary results. 
The achieved effects and high degree of innovation of the project recommended Montenegro to receive several awards from reputable international organizations, the most prestigious of which is the second prize of the international initiative of the Open Government Partnership in competition with the best projects from 33 countries.
So far, citizens have pointed out over 3,500 irregularities in the area of ​​the gray economy. 
Based on their reports, inspectors imposed fines of over one million euros. 
By the decision of the Government, half of this amount is set aside for projects of social significance that the citizens have identified and voted for.
In the first phase of the project, 250,000 euros were allocated for five projects, namely: procurement of gastro and colonoscopic equipment for the Institute for Children's Diseases, equipping and arranging day care centers for children and youth with disabilities in the municipalities of Cetinje, Niksic and Plav, park landscaping on Ćemovsko polje, reconstruction of a part of the Home for the Elderly Grabovac in Risan and procurement of didactic equipment for state kindergartens
The second phase of the project lasts until the end of December this year, after which we will discuss the possibility of continuing the campaign with partners and interested non-governmental organizations.
The focus of Montenegro's economic policy is directed towards fiscal instruments, due to the non-issuance function of the Central Bank and passive monetary policy. 
In such an institutional framework, fiscal policy plays a crucial role in creating long-term stability and is the most important segment of economic policy. 

In this regard, the Ministry of Finance has prepared a medium-term strategy for the implementation of fiscal policy, which will be harmonized with the principles of predictability and accountability, as well as with the fiscal rules established by the Law on Budget and Fiscal Responsibility.
The proposed model of tax system reform envisages a change in the structure of taxation, which implies a transfer to taxes that have a lower negative impact on economic growth, with a possible reduction in the tax burden on profits and income. 
In this way, the potential for growth would be released, which, along with accompanying reforms in other areas, would contribute to more efficient valorization of our resources, and faster realization of basic economic policy goals - strengthening economic competitiveness, achieving higher economic growth rates and increasing population standards.
In order to adequately valorize resources, and gradually change the economic structure and development model, the proposed measures within the mentioned strategy will create preconditions for active sectoral policies, in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy and increase exports, which will positively affect the balance of payments in the exchange of goods with foreign countries. 
To this end, the strategy proposes appropriate fiscal incentives for sectoral priorities, primarily tourism, energy, agriculture and the metal industry, taking care not to undermine the country's existing fiscal position.
We expect it by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. 
It is a systemic law, which will address one of the most important issues for 40,000 public sector employees. Therefore, the definition of its provisions should be approached responsibly and the principles of transparency and fairness should be respected. 
Therefore, the definition of its provisions should be approached responsibly and the principles of transparency and fairness should be respected.
The law will bring, among other things, a novelty whose absence disrupted the system of justice in the wage system and caused a weakened motivation of a certain number of employees. 
The provisions of this law will also define the principle according to which the total salary fund will be conditioned by the movement of fiscal and macroeconomic parameters.
The mentioned law will also discuss the issue of salaries in public companies, whereby the Ministry of Finance is of the opinion that the salary fund in public companies should be conditioned by business results.
The Ministry of Finance does not transfer funds to the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund to the business account, but since 2009, this institution has been included in the Consolidated Treasury Account. 
For ten months of the current year, the Ministry, according to the orders of the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, paid 10 pensions in the total amount of 323.39 million euros.
In the last two years, there has been evident progress in napalti contributions.
This contributed to a certain improvement in the percentage of coverage of pension expenditures by contribution revenues and a reduction in the pension fund deficit from 43.5 percent in 2012 to 36.5 percent in 2014. 
On the other hand, pension expenditures are constantly growing, which has a negative impact on the sustainability of the system, and the Government is committed to seeking a model that would provide an adequate balance of pension fund revenues and expenditures and make the pension system stable and sustainable in the long run.
Current and future projects in the field of tourism, in addition to significantly improving and enriching the tourist offer of Montenegro, will have a number of direct effects that will be reflected in employment growth and budget revenues and more dynamic growth rates of the Montenegrin economy, as well as indirect, primarily in attracting new investor.
We have extremely good cooperation with the World Bank, which results in the implementation of specific projects in the field of energy, agriculture, land management and administration, education and science, health, environmental protection, 
 At the same time, the World Bank, for the third year in a row, provides direct budget support, under extremely favorable conditions. 
Also, we cooperate with this financial institution in the part of reviewing the financial and fiscal situation of Montenegro and defining and implementing measures and activities aimed at its further improvement.
Cooperation is based on the principle of exchange of opinions and mutual respect and is aimed at establishing and strengthening the fiscal and financial stability of Montenegro. 
In this regard, the World Bank provides strong support for the process of fiscal adjustment and economic reforms. 
The World Bank's Economic Report "Montenegro - Preparing for Prosperity" covers the previous period and the current state of the Montenegrin economy and provides recommendations for future development. 
The report recognizes the main challenges of the Montenegrin economy that the Government has identified as key, namely vulnerabilities in the fiscal sphere, which primarily relate to the level of budget deficit and public debt, then illiquidity problems in the real economy and weak credit activity of banks, as and the need to strengthen competitiveness and attract FDI more strongly.
In order to overcome these challenges, it is necessary to resort to structural and regulatory reforms, respect the principles of fiscal responsibility and improve the business environment. 
Only in this way can the preconditions be created for increasing the potential growth rates that bring quality of life to every citizen of Montenegro. 
Development priorities must be set on the foundations of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, through investment in innovation, digitalization and mobility of young people, as well as through improving resource efficiency, ie comparative advantages in increasing employment, social inclusion and poverty reduction.
Instead of borrowing, excessive consumption and imports, and overheating of demand, which have been the characteristics of the model over the last 20 years, it is necessary to develop a new business model, ie a strategy of sustainable development, which will be based on the growth of domestic savings, increasing productivity and improving competitiveness. 
Competitiveness needs to be improved by creating policies based on productivity, innovation and entrepreneurship development. 
Such a choice of economic policies contributes to the creation of a stable financial system, and success will depend on the dynamics and level of adjustment of the economy itself. 
Thus, the basic pillar of the development policy of an open and euroized economy such as Montenegro is the improvement of the business environment with an emphasis on raising the competitiveness of the system. 
In our conditions, undoubted contribution to strengthening development, ie the foundations of development, is given by painful and unpopular measures of fiscal adjustment, as well as reduction of participation of informal economy, ie its suppression, which creates fair business conditions for all market participants, according to fairness and healthy competition.
In the long run, a sustainable macroeconomic strategy, together with prudent and sustainable fiscal policy, creates greater opportunities for increased competitiveness and stable economic development. 
It is necessary to continue market reforms, establish a stimulating economic environment and accelerate the EU accession process.
In this way, we will generate increased foreign investors, which will encourage value creation and provide stronger GDP growth.
According to Monstat data, in the period January-September, 3% more tourists visited our country and 2.3% more overnight stays than in the same period last year, with foreign tourists achieving a growth of arrivals and overnight stays of 4, 1 and 2.3%, respectively. 
When we talk about indicators in tourism, we consider especially representative data on the export of tourist services, ie. about the consumption that tourists make while staying in our country.
Revenue from services in 2011 amounted to EUR 619.4 million or 19.4% of GDP, in 2012 to EUR 643.1 million or 20.4% of GDP, and this year, in eight months it was realized 620.6 million euros, which is 1.9% more than in the previous year. 
Having in mind these data, it is clear that this sector, from year to year, gives an increasingly strong contribution to our economy, which we expect to be even greater in the coming years, given the numerous current and announced investments in this sector.
In the last few years, there has been a deterioration in the basic indicators of fiscal stability, namely the budget deficit and the level of public debt.
Due to the achieved limits of these indicators and the maturity of liabilities in the segment of debt repayment in the forthcoming period, there is the presence of certain risks that clearly indicate the need for additional caution in conducting borrowing policy and overall fiscal policy. 
At the same time, such a situation confirms the importance of the implementation of the Government's plans related to medium-term consolidation. 
Namely, the policy of the Ministry of Finance in this and next year is determined by the urgent and urgent need to reverse the trend of public debt. 
In order to achieve this, the priority goal, we are working in parallel on several tracks. 
We have completed the first, in my opinion the most painful phase, which referred to the introduction of a package of urgent fiscal adjustment measures, and it has given excellent results.
We expect that by the end of the year we will collect revenues that will be about 100 million euros higher than the realization in 2012. 
This confirms that fiscal consolidation is a prerequisite for a lasting recovery of public finances and ensuring financial and macroeconomic stability. 
In order to further contribute to the stabilization of public finances, the Ministry of Finance, along with the budget for the next fiscal year, will propose to the Government a set of measures whose implementation will make a significant contribution to continuing fiscal consolidation.
Apart from consolidating public finances, in order to establish fiscal, macroeconomic and financial stability and long-term sustainability, the only realistic model for reducing the deficit and the public debt generated by it is to encourage the creation of new value, ie to dynamize GDP growth. 
Therefore, we are committed to creating preconditions for achieving stronger rates of economic growth, through the implementation of structural and regulatory reforms, improving the business environment and supporting current and announced investments in tourism, energy, infrastructure, transport ... which will have positive multiplier effects on overall economic the system.
Calculations and estimates of data related to the tourism sector are performed by the CBM and are the same part of the data on the balance of payments, which is within the competence of that institution. 
The calculation is made on the basis of data on the number of realized overnight stays and calculation of average consumption by categories of tourists with certain corrections.
Tourism certainly significantly affects the overall economic flows, because this sector has multiplier effects on other, directly and indirectly, related industries, such as: trade, transport, agriculture, telecommunications, insurance, 
Also, during the tourist season there is growth deposits, because revenues from tourism spill over into financial flows. 
This has a further positive effect on the banking system as it increases the quality of the banking services offer. 
In the tourist season, the collection of all types of budget revenues related to the increased turnover of goods and services is intensifying, which has positive effects on fiscal indicators.
Furthermore, current and future projects in the field of tourism, in addition to significantly improving and enriching the tourist offer of Montenegro, will have a number of direct effects that will be reflected in employment growth and budget revenues and more dynamic growth rates of the Montenegrin economy, as well as indirect,
I believe that the construction of new infrastructure facilities, such as highways, is not only an opportunity to create new jobs and create new value, but also a need caused by the existence of development bottlenecks that need to be eliminated so that we can develop certain activities faster and use them more efficiently potentials, especially those in the north of the state.
I am of the opinion that the construction of the highway would have a number of positive effects, from increasing employment in the construction sector and related sectors (trade, transport and other services in line with the share of domestic operations in the project), to increasing budget revenues for taxes, to faster regional development, through the growth of economic activity and employment in the northern region. 
This is confirmed by our preliminary estimates, which say that an investment worth 19.6% of projected GDP will cause direct GDP growth of 6.6% over the entire period or an average of 1.3% per year.
The gray economy is one of the biggest challenges facing the Montenegrin economy, its consequences are visible in the areas of tax evasion, market distortion, unfair competition and inefficient allocation of resources. 
Reducing the informal economy is one of the imperatives for the Montenegrin government. 
This is not only due to the creation of unfair competition and the weakening of the competitiveness of companies operating in the formal zone, but also due to the increased crisis burden that the formal zone bears due to the existence of a significant informal sector.
In that context, the measures implemented by the state on fiscal consolidation and mitigation of the consequences of the crisis burden the subjects in the formal zone, first through regular payment of taxes, and then through payment of additional anti-crisis levies in order to reduce fiscal deficit and debt repayment.
In this context, the identification of the informal economy and inclusion in fiscal flows is very important, while lost fiscal revenues would significantly improve the budget and balance of payments of Montenegro. 
Determined to fight the gray market, the Government formed the Commission for the Suppression of the Gray Economy, which includes, in addition to representatives of the competent state bodies, representatives of the social partners, the economy, the Parliament of Montenegro and the State Prosecutor's Office. 
What is the goal of forming the mentioned commission is, first of all, more efficient cooperation of the competent bodies, and then the involvement of the social partners, in response to their demands, and Members of Parliament, with a view to fuller transparency and stronger cooperation with Parliament. 
This achieves the necessary synergetic effects and constructive discussion of all stakeholders and provides an overview of the effects of the proposed measures at the broadest level. 
The Commission bases its work on a single commitment - a zero tolerance rate for the gray economy, while respecting the principles of non-selectivity and full transparency and rigorous punitive measures, which are not aimed at the revenue side of the budget, but at suppressing the informal economy and unfair competition.
Within the Commission, several operational teams were formed which, in the previous period, carried out a significant volume of activities focused on the areas characterized by the highest degree of perception gray economy, namely: labor market, turnover of excise products and payment of VAT through the issuance of fiscal invoices. 
The Commission has also initiated regulatory amendments frameworks in those segments where there were certain "ambiguities" or "gaps" that were, in practice, abused, as well as the tightening of penal policy for tax offenses, as well as for offenses related to undeclared work. 
At the same time, a strong media campaign was launched at the national level, aimed at strengthening everyone's fiscal discipline taxpayers. 
The intention is to motivate citizens and the economy to behave responsibly, by raising awareness that the gray economy has negative consequences for the state budget, and thus for the citizen, who is a direct user of budget funds, as well as for the economy, which is due to the gray economy. , exposed to unfair competition. 
The revenues generated this year are the best confirmation of the justification of the existence and work of the Commission. 
The strong fight against the gray economy and the implemented fiscal consolidation measures have given and are giving extraordinary effects. 
Despite operating in difficult conditions, budget revenues in the period from January 1 to November 15, 2013 are higher by about 98 million euros, or 10% compared to the comparable period last year.
During 2014, the decisive fight against the gray economy will continue through new higher penalties for returnees in misdemeanors, announced the Minister of Finance Radoje Žugić in an interview for Dnevne novine. 
He announced that the abolition of the crisis tax would be considered next year, and pointed out that 2013 was "successful" despite major problems, which is illustrated by the fact that by December 29, 116 million euros more budget revenues were collected than last year.
Fiscal policy, as the most important segment of economic policy, should support measures that should contribute to more dynamic economic growth, reduction of regional disparities in terms of development, new employment, fairer social policy and mitigation of negative demographic trends, especially in the north. 
We used to have a village without peasants, and now I am afraid we will have a village without inhabitants. 
This is a rough definition, but it is so.
All these are the goals of economic policy, the realization of which is aimed at achieving the primary goal, which is to improve the quality of life of citizens
The precondition for the development of any economy is financial stability. 
It makes the system stronger and more resilient to external shocks, to which small and open economies, such as Montenegro, are particularly exposed. 
Financial stability in Montenegro is based on three basic elements, namely the sustainability of the fiscal system, banking stability and improving competitiveness.
I think we had a successful year and that is the success of the whole team in the Ministry, but none of that | it would not be if we did not have strong political support from the rest of the Government. 
And the achieved results confirm that we are on the path to recovery of public finances and ensuring financial and macroeconomic stability, which is a precondition for the growth and development of any economy.
In order to further approach the full balance of public finances, the intention of the Ministry of Finance is to, through the continuation of the fiscal consolidation process and the creation and conduct of a consistent economic policy, create preconditions for improving national and economic economy, which will indirectly encourage new value and provide stronger GDP growth.
As for the activities on the suppression of the gray economy, I expect their continuation in the same or even greater scope and dynamics, while respecting the same principles of action of inspection bodies: transparency, non-selectivity and zero tolerance rate. 
As for expectations when it comes to the effects of the fight against the gray economy, I expect an improvement in tax discipline and awareness of citizens that the regular functioning of institutions and everything that belongs to the public interest can be ensured only if tax obligations are properly serviced. 
Tougher penalties YES, for returnees in violation (for the first quarter of 2014, the preparation of a new law is planned which will tighten the penal policy towards returnees in violation and introduce rigorous measures against these entities). 
During 2014, we will continue to strengthen the institutional and personnel capacities of state administration bodies responsible for revenue control and collection.
It seems to me more and more that everyone recognizes that it was necessary to start the fight against the gray economy, and we are determined to persevere in that. 
If we want sustainability, then we need to know that everyone needs it. 
We will be even more ruthless in the fight against the gray economy.
The Ministry of Finance has prepared a draft Law on Budget and Fiscal Responsibility, which defines accountability measures and penal provisions. 
Namely, the draft law specifically regulates the issue of inspection supervision, so in order to strengthen the control of budget spending during the fiscal year, the institute of budget inspector is defined, the scope of activities, as well as the powers essentially determined by the Law on Inspection Supervision. 
Budget inspection is an element of preventive control, and partly a corrective element. 
Measures of responsibility of authorized persons in state bodies in case of irresponsible behavior and causing financial damage have been determined. 
The law prescribes fines for non-compliance with certain provisions of this law, which range from 200 euros for mild to 4,000 euros for serious violations of the law.
As for borrowing in 2014, the draft Budget Law stipulates that the Government may borrow up to EUR 240 million, which will be provided through the issue of bonds on foreign markets, the issuance of domestic bonds and / or treasury bills or credit arrangements with domestic and foreign financial institutions, as well as with other institutions, which will depend on market conditions. 
Out of 240 million, 171 million is for refinancing, and the rest is a deficit that is ambitiously planned for next year, below two percent of GDP. 
We will comprehensively look at and study all the possibilities of borrowing. 
When deciding on specific forms and institutions with which to borrow, it is necessary, in addition to the price of funds expressed in interest rates, to take into account other important parameters, such as repayment deadlines, speed of use of funds, or their availability, meeting certain conditions and Similarly.
At the same time, during the next year, we will be dedicated to activities on public debt restructuring, ie finding ways to increase the repayment period and provide potentially lower interest rates, in order to reduce the risk of budget financing in the coming years and reverse the public debt trend. its gradual reduction in the coming period.
I believe and expect that it will not, because the intention of the law is not to reduce salaries, but to bring order and systematically resolve this issue, in order to ensure the unification of the method of calculating salaries for performing the same tasks. 
The primary goal of the law is to ensure equal and merit-based determination of personal income of employees, through the introduction of mechanisms that recognize and reward high quality work and increase the professionalism and efficiency of public services.
In nine months, they had a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP, according to the CBM, and that deficit would be without guarantees, court costs.
We will continue the process of strengthening tax discipline next year. 
Very soon, we will consider abolishing some measures, such as the crisis tax, and in that way enable us to have an even more competitive tax system.
I believe that the projected growth rate of 3.6 percent will be achieved at the beginning and realization of several large infrastructure projects.
In the first ten months of this year, 72.8m euros in payroll taxes were collected, up 11.7 per cent from the same period last year. 
The increase in income on this basis is predominantly a consequence of the introduction of the "crisis" tax, said the Minister of Finance Radoje Žugić in an interview for "Dan". 
He pointed out that they expect ten million euros from the crisis salary tax by the end of the year. 
So much has been charged so far from a one-euro tax, more than half of which relates to SIM cards.
Savings of 12m euros have been made since the pension adjustment was frozen. 
It is important, however, to point out that the number of pension and disability insurance beneficiaries has increased by about two thousand, which has created additional pressure on the already high deficit of the pension system, said Žugić.
The effects of the measures introduced earlier this year, in the form of better collection of budget revenues and improvement of tax discipline, confirmed that fiscal consolidation is a precondition for a lasting recovery of public finances and ensuring financial and macroeconomic stability. 
In addition to the results of the fight against the gray economy, fiscal adjustment measures contributed to the realization of budget revenues for the first ten months of the year, which exceeded both the plan and last year's revenues for the same period. 
The eventual repeal of the measures would, possibly, weaken the revenue side of the budget, so we would have a larger deficit and a higher level of public debt.
