Public Audit in the European Union 2019 Edition
AUSTRIA
Mission statement: Independent, objective and at your service.
GENERAL INFORMATION
The Austrian Court of Audit (ACA) is the independent supreme audit institution at federal, provincial and municipal level.
It verifies that state funds are being correctly administered, including state spending by public institutions and state funds used by private institutions (on the basis of uniformity of auditing).
The ACA scrutinises whether resources available are being used economically, efficiently and effectively. In addition to audits and consultations – its most important strategic function – the ACA also performs further tasks of relevance for public policy and a number of notarial functions.
The ACA decides on the types, themes and methodology of its audits on its own initiative and independently.
The ACA is constitutionally mandated to carry out special audits. For example: on a resolution from the Austrian Federal Parliament or a provincial one; at the request of the members of the Austrian Federal Parliament or a provincial one; and based on a reasonable request from the Federal Government, provincial Government or a Federal Minister.
The Constitution limits the number of such requests to ensure the independence of the ACA’s audit planning.
In addition, the ACA takes on important special tasks, such as: compiling the Federal financial statements; working on the statement of financial debt; reviewing draft laws and regulations; tasks under the Incompatibility Act, Income Limitation Act and Party Act; tasks relating to the report on the average incomes and retirement pensions paid by Federal Government enterprises and agencies; and finally the establishment of expert opinions for arbitration panels, according to the Stability Pact 2008.
KEY LEGISLATION
The activities, functions, organisation and position of the ACA are governed by:
Chapter VI of the Federal Constitutional Law (1920);
Federal Act on the Austrian Court of Audit (Austrian Court of Audit Act 1948 – RHG);
Constitutional Court Act (if differences of opinion arise between the ACA and a legal entity regarding powers and rights, the ACA can call upon the Constitutional Court to make a decision);
Federal Law on the Rules of Procedure of the National Council (the provincial parliaments govern the strategically important participation of the ACA in committee meetings and plenary sessions);
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (applies directly to the auditing of EU community resources and cooperation with the European Court of Auditors).
The ACA audits the financial affairs (i.e. the financial activities) of: the state, the provinces, municipal associations, municipalities with more than 10 000 inhabitants and other legal entities defined by law; foundations, funds and institutes which are administered by federal, provincial or municipal institutions or individuals which themselves form part of a federal, provincial or municipal institution; organisations in which the state, a province or a municipality with at least 10 000 inhabitants has de facto control or holds at least 50 % of the share, stock or equity capital, or which are operated by the state, a province or a municipality alone or together with other contracting parties; federal, provincial and municipal public legal entities using federal, provincial or municipal funds; social insurance bodies and statutory associations of employers, employees and professionals (chambers); and legal entities established by law, e.g. ORF (Austrian Broadcasting Corporation).
TYPE OF SAI: A distinct model, headed by a President and auditing at federal, provincial and municipal level following the Westminster model.
The ACA is Austria’s Supreme Audit Institution and reports directly to the national parliament. It acts:
as an agent for the national parliament in matters pertaining to the Federal administration of public funds and the financial administration of the statutory professional associations under the executive authority of the Austrian Federation;
as an agent for Provincial parliaments concerned in matters pertaining to provinces, municipal associations, and municipal administration of public funds as well as the financial administration of the statutory professional associations under the executive authority of the provinces.
The ACA is independent of the Federal Government and the Provincial Governments and subject only to the provisions of the law and is therefore allocated to the legislative branch.
The President of the ACA communicates with the national Parliament and its committees directly and personally or through an agent delegated by him.
The President of the ACA is entitled to participate in debates in the national Parliament and its (sub-) committees on ACA reports, the final federal budget accounts, motions concerning the implementation of specific actions in the ACA’s examination of the administration of public funds, and the subdivisions related to the ACA in the Federal Finance Act.
The President of the ACA is always entitled, in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Federal Law on the Rules of Procedure of the national Parliament, to be heard in the debates on the subjects listed above, at his request.
The ACA provides an annual report on its activities to the national Parliament, provincial parliaments, and the municipal council. It can report its observations on individual matters to the national Parliament, the provincial parliaments, and the municipal councils at any time and, if necessary, make proposals. The ACA informs the Federal Government of all its reports at the same time as submitting them to the national Parliament.
Furthermore, a standing committee is appointed by the national Parliament to discuss the ACA’s reports. Its appointment maintains the principle of proportional representation.
ORGANISATION
PRESIDENT: Margit Kraker was appointed on 1 July 2016.
TENURE: 12 years, non-renewable.
SELECTION METHOD: The ACA’s President is elected on the proposal of the Main Committee of the national Parliament. Before taking office, he or she is sworn in by the Federal President. The President of the ACA may not be a member of a general representative body or the European Parliament and may not have been a member of the Federal Government or a Provincial Government in the past five years. With regard to accountability, the President of the ACA has the same status as members of the Federal Government or members of the Provincial Government concerned, depending on whether the ACA acts as executive officer of the national Parliament or of a provincial one.
GOVERNING BODY: The ACA does not have a governing body. Its President has the exclusive decision-making authority. There is no permanent Vice-President of the ACA. Should the President be prevented from the discharge of his or her responsibilities, the most senior ranking official of the ACA represents him or her. This also applies if the office of the President is vacant.
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
The ACA is organised into five divisions (one management and administration division and four audit divisions). The audit divisions consist of two audit units each, where three to four audit departments are grouped thematically (i.e. four audit divisions with eight audit units and in total 34 audit departments).
This organisational structure allows inter-divisional strategy and audit planning, optimised use of resources by flexible, cooperative audit teams, and fosters and improves the inter-divisional exchange of knowledge.
Each unit is also a “Centre of Excellence” for topical cross-divisional areas such as subsidies, fraud prevention and compliance, cyber security etc.
STAFF
Number: 273 (approx. 81 % in audit)
Gender balance: 52 % men; 48 % women. Average age: 48
BUDGET: 33.5 million euros (2018), 0.04 % of total Government budget.
AUDIT WORK
The ACA plans its work on an annual basis.
In Austria, the ACA may also be asked to carry out special audits. This is based on a resolution from the National Council or a provincial Parliament, or from members of the National Council or a provincial Parliament, or at the reasonable request of the Federal Government or a provincial Government or a Federal Minister. However, the Constitution limits the number of requests to ensure the independence of the ACA’s audit planning.
As of 2017, the ACA started an initiative to involve the public via Facebook for the first time. Citizens were encouraged to participate in the development of audit topics by proposing topics of interest. Their proposals were considered where possible in the audit planning process and discussed in the annual audit planning conference.
The ACA carries out about 90 audits every year, at federal, provincial and municipal level.
The ACA’s auditing criteria are the legal principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness, on the basis of regularity and legality.
The ACA carries out audits combining: performance audits and financial audits.
OUTPUT
The ACA submits its reports at federal, provincial and municipal level. In addition to this, the ACA publishes reports: regarding the investigation and evaluation of issues; highlighting and quantifying potential improvements; establishing and quantifying financial issues; and issuing concrete and implementable recommendations.
The ACA disseminates its publications: on its website; on social media; in press releases.
At national level, the ACA cooperates with the provincial audit institutions to coordinate their respective annual audit plans.
Since 1963 the ACA has run the General Secretariat of INTOSAI.

AUDIT WORK
The SAO plans and performs its audits independently according to its Annual Programme and Work Plan. Parliament can request to include audits in the SAO’s work plan, but in practice this is rarely the case.
The Annual Audit Programme and Work Plan are approved by the Auditor General, as well as guidance on the preparation of the annual programme and work plan. The annual programme and work plan contain obligatory audits, as well as audits of other subjects.
The audit on the State Budget Execution is an obligatory audit that is based on the provisions of the State Audit Office Act, while other obligatory audits are determined by the provisions of the Law on the Financing of Political Activities and Election Campaigns.
Audits of other subjects that fall within the mandate of the SAO are determined on the basis of criteria which are defined by the State Audit Office Act. 
These are: risk assessment; the financial importance of audit subjects; the results of previous audits – opinion given; collected information about subject operations and management and other criteria which are determined in the SAO’s internal regulations (unrealised recommendations, publications in the media).

financial audits, which include examination of documents, reports, internal control systems and internal audit, accounting and financial procedures and other records to verify that the financial statements present a true and fair financial position, and that the results of the financial activities are in line with the accepted accounting standards and principles; and
compliance audit, which includes examination of financial transactions in terms of legal use of funds; and
performance audits, which assess the economy and efficiency of operations, and how effectively the general objectives, or the objectives of individual financial transactions, programmes and projects were met.
The SAO performs audits in accordance with the international auditing standards (ISSAIs), and its own code of ethics. It uses performance and financial audit manuals as well as guidelines.
OUTPUT
The SAO’s reports are: an Annual Work Report containing the results of the SAO’s audit work for the reporting period and its other activities; audit reports on financial, compliance and performance audits; and audit reports on thematic audits which are published simultaneously with single audit reports, containing the results of single audits on certain themes (for example auditing hospitals or national parks).
The SAO publishes notices about new audit reports or other activities on its website.
All audit reports are published on the website upon completion. At the same time a press release is issued and a press conference is organised.
The SAO submits audit reports to the parliament immediately after they are completed and published.
The SAO publishes its Annual work report and its Strategic and Annual plans on its website (the first one only once parliament has been informed about it).
The SAO cooperates with other state authorities in carrying out its tasks, without prejudice to its autonomy and independence. In accordance with this requirement, the State Audit Office cooperates with judicial and state bodies.
After they have been submitted to parliament, audit reports are submitted to the State Attorney’s Office.
The SAO also submits the required audit reports and available documentation to the Ministry of the Interior, at its request.
After audits of political parties, independent representatives and members of the representative bodies of local units elected from the voter list, the SAO must inform the State Attorney’s Office of any violations of the Law.

The Parliamentary Committee on Development Plans and Public Expenditure Control regularly examines the recommendations and observations of the AORC to monitor the response of audited agencies to the AORC’s observations and recommendations.
In addition, almost all Parliamentary committees regularly request the assistance of the AORC in issues relating to its responsibilities. Occasionally the AORC has a contributory role in the legislative process. The parliament may ask the AORC to perform special investigations or audits.
The Auditor General performs audits and submits annual reports to the President of the Republic of Cyprus and other audit reports to the auditees.

The SAO consists of the Audit Section, the Administrative Section and the Office of the President of the SAO. These are divided into specialised departments that are further divided into units.
The SAO management reports directly to the President. These are the Senior Director of the Audit Section, the Senior Director of the Administrative Section, the Director of the President’s Office, the Board Secretary, the Director of the Security Department and the Director of the Internal Audit Department.
STAFF
Number: 461 (approx. 70 % in audit)
Gender balance: 38 % men; 62 % women ( 51 % men; 49 % women for management functions). Average age: 46
BUDGET: The SAO’s expenditure is covered by the state budget of the Czech Republic. 20.1 million euros (2017), 0.04 % of total government budget.
AUDIT WORK
The SAO plans its work in an annual audit plan, which is based on suggestions from the President, Members of the Board, internal analysis or external stakeholders.
The government, the Chamber of Deputies or the Senate of the parliament of the Czech Republic and their bodies can suggest audits to the SAO, which it can take on or reject at its own discretion.
These audit suggestions summarise the subject and objectives of the audit, and indicate the auditees, the timing of and reason for the audit, information about the legal and economic position of the proposed auditees, information about previous identical or similar audits, the basic characteristics of the audited area, the audit hypotheses, and so on.
Under its defined powers, the SAO performs audits in line with its audit standards, which are based on the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions. The SAO performs audits in line with the legal regulations, which encompass legality audits, financial audits, and performance audits. An audit comprises a preparatory phase, an execution phase, and an audit conclusion phase. An audit takes 10 months on average to complete, with 5 to 30 auditors taking part, depending on the number of auditees.
The SAO examines whether the activities audited comply with the legislation, reviews the substantive and formal accuracy of these activities and assesses whether they are effective, economical and efficient.
The SAO’s financial audits check whether the audited entities’ financial statements give a true and fair view of the subject of the accounting in accordance with the legal regulations.
OUTPUT
The SAO’s main output takes the form of audit conclusions which are published on the SAO’s website and in the SAO’s Bulletin as soon as the audit conclusion has been approved by the Board of the SAO. The President of the SAO sends all approved audit conclusions to the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate, and the government.
The SAO is legally obliged to publish:
the Bulletin of the SAO, an official publication that contains a summary of audit reports for a given period. One edition also contains the Annual Audit Plan and further editions may reflect changes in the Annual Audit Plan;
the Annual Report which contains an overview of the audits and audit results from the past year and information about the SAO’s cooperation with criminal justice authorities, information provided to citizens, international cooperation activities, and the SAO’s financial management and staff;
the Statement on the Implementation of the State Budget, in which the SAO gives its opinion on the government’s report on the implementation of the state budget, based on its assessment of the administration of the state budget in the first six months of the relevant year;
the Statement on the State Final Account. In this document the SAO gives its opinion on the draft of the state final account of the Czech Republic for the relevant year, based on its evaluation of the economic situation in the country and the results of the state’s financial management; and
the Final Account, comprising information on the financial management of the SAO for the past year. An external auditor verifies the Final Account each year, after which the SAO President submits it to the Czech Parliament.
In addition to this, the SAO also issues other publications, such as the EU Report (in which the SAO presents its comparison and assessment of the uptake and use of EU funds by the Czech Republic), handbooks, topical papers, and reports on audits the SAO conducted in parallel with other SAIs.
The SAO strives to make information on audit results easily accessible to the public. Therefore, it publishes audit conclusions, press releases, and other relevant documents on its website and on social media. There it also communicates the results of its audits, analysis and news, videos regarding its audits, and other information about its activities.
The SAO values transparency and therefore publishes its own contracts on its website, together with details about its budget and other data.
Finally, it also organises events. Its first public administration Hackathon took place in 2017 and was followed up by a second one in 2018.
Sharing knowledge is one of the SAO’s main aims in the international environment. Therefore, it supports knowledge sharing in international activities and also through cooperative audits.
The SAO organises several conferences, seminars, and other professionally-oriented activities every year. Designed both for the SAO’s staff and for the professional public and representatives of other state institutions, these activities assist in improving public administration.
These are intended to create a platform for sharing knowledge and good practice not only among the public, but also among academics, experts in given fields, students, and other concerned groups.
On the international level, the SAO regularly sends its auditors to participate in the audit bodies of international organisations. The SAO has had representatives in bodies such as EUROCONTROL, the European Defence Agency and the European Space Agency.

GERMANY
Mission statement: The fundamental principles underlying the German SAI’s work are independence, neutrality, objectivity and credibility. The purpose of its work is to enhance the transparency, efficiency and sustainability of government action.
GENERAL INFORMATION
The German SAI audits all federal revenues and expenditures, as well as representational funds and secret expenditure, and determines whether the federal budget has been managed properly and efficiently.
It has full rights of access to any body and any information it requires for its audit work, including non-federal entities where these manage federal funds.
KEY LEGISLATION: Constitution (Article 114, paragraph 2, Basic Law) (1949); Federal Budget Code (Article 88 et seq.) (1969); Budgetary Principles Act (Article 53 et seq.) (1969); German SAI Act.
The German SAI has access to any institution or body managing federal funds, e.g.: government ministries and their subordinate bodies; state agencies; social security institutions; public enterprises; federal grantees and administrative units of constitutional bodies.
TYPE OF SAI: A collegiate structure with no jurisdictional function.
The German SAI is a supreme federal authority and ranks equally with federal ministries.
It is fully independent and does not take instructions to perform specific audit work. However, Parliament may propose certain audits to the German SAI.
The President of the German SAI holds an ex officio position as Federal Performance Commissioner. He puts forward recommendations, reports and opinions in order to enhance the efficiency of the federal administration. He may also advise Parliament on legislation.
Through its audit and advisory work, the German SAI supports the German federal government and parliament, which uses the German SAI’s annual report as a basis for granting discharge to the federal government.
The German SAI reports to both the executive and the legislative branches of federal government and may give advice before final decision-making.
It also participates in the budget negotiations between the federal Ministry of Finance and the line departments and may provide input on each departmental budget estimate. In addition to this, it gives advice during budget implementation.
AUDIT WORK
The President, Vice-President, Senate and all collegiate bodies are involved in the German SAI’s strategic and work planning.
The German SAI’s audit units regularly carry out a risk and task analysis, which forms the basis of a medium-term audit plan as well as an audit strategy for the next three to five years.
The units plan their audit tasks in annual audit plans in a coordinated manner, and these plans form the basis for the overall audit plan of the German SAI.
The German SAI is free to decide on audit requests from Parliament or parliamentary committees.
The German SAI carries out performance, compliance and financial audits, both ex post and in real-time, and provides pro-active advice. It determines the timing and nature of its audit work independently and may carry out fieldwork.
Performance audits are a key task, and these are typically combined with compliance or financial audit elements in a comprehensive audit. The German SAI uses sustainability as an additional strategic audit criterion.
The German SAI‘s work also includes:
selective audits, which involve in-depth examinations designed to gather evidence on a particular aspect of the audit matter;
horizontal audits, which study a specific subject across a representative selection of government bodies to develop audit findings on a defined area of government operations and transactions;
exploratory studies, which are a tool for obtaining insights into specific problem areas, procedures or developments. These do not aim at providing a final evaluation of government operations and transactions, but are a suitable option to prepare for new audit missions;
follow-up audits, which serve to identify whether the authorities with oversight have acted on the audit findings or on parliamentary resolutions;
management audits (or general audits), which serve to obtain a comprehensive overview of the audited body’s financial management; and
real-time audits, which allow the German SAI to examine the multitude of individual decisions that major programmes entail, separately and at each project stage. This approach allows it to detect shortcomings at an early stage and inform decision-making bodies in good time.

STAFF (AS OF OCTOBER 2018)
Total: 1 163 (82 % in audit)
Gender balance: 58 % men; 42 % women. Average age: 51
BUDGET: 149 million euros, 0.04 % of the total federal budget
OUTPUT
The German SAI issues: management letters with audit findings, which it sends to the audited bodies for comment; an annual report composed of a principal volume (I) and a supplementary volume (II). Volume I is published in autumn each year and volume II in spring of the following year. Taken together they form an up-to-date basis for the parliamentary discharge procedure; advisory reports; and special purpose reports.
It submits its advisory and special purpose reports to parliament and the federal government.
In addition to this, in his or her function of Federal Performance Commissioner, the President publishes a series of opinions and good practice guides.
The German SAI includes recommendations for improvement in its management letters and reports, and comments on topical issues such as draft legislation and major procurement projects, or provides expert input.
The German SAI presents its annual report to the public at a federal press conference and publishes its work (including the annual report, special purpose reports and final audit letters) on its website.
The special reports and the outputs of the Federal Performance Commissioner also feature there.
Since Germany has a federal government structure, regional audit institutions and municipal audit offices audit the other levels of government. However, as the fiscal systems of the Federation and of the sixteen constituent states of the Federal Republic are largely intertwined, the German SAI and the independent regional audit institutions of the states work closely together.
This cooperation focuses mainly on programmes that the Federal Government and the states fund jointly, or on responsibilities that the central government has delegated to the states.

ITALY
Mission statement: According to Article 100 of the Italian Constitution, the Corte dei conti exercises preventive control over the legitimacy of Government measures and also ex post auditing of the administration of the State Budget. It participates, in the cases and ways established by law, in auditing the financial management of the entities receiving regular budgetary support from the State. It reports directly to Parliament on the results of audits performed. The law ensures the independence from the Government of the Corte dei conti and its members. It is composed of independent magistrates, answerable only before the law, who may be assigned to audit and legal departments or to the Public Prosecutor’s offices.
GENERAL INFORMATION
In Italy’s constitutional architecture, the Corte dei conti occupies a position between bodies guaranteeing lawful, proper administration and oversight of the stability of public finances, and legal bodies.
The Corte dei conti (Cdc), in exercising control functions, is neutral and independent of the Government and Parliament, and in its legal function is, to all intents and purposes, part of the judiciary.
JURISDICTIONAL COMPETENCE
According to Article 103(2) of the Italian Constitution, the Cdc has jurisdiction in matters of public accounts and in other matters laid down by law.
Accordingly, in case of ascertained damage to public funds, the liability of directors, employees and accounting officers does not follow the ordinary rules of civil law, but assumes the peculiar characteristics of administrative and accounting liability.
Where there is a loss to public funds, the liability of administrative officials – of the State or of any public administration – and of public or private entities and/or individuals managing public funds in the public interest can be ascertained.
The Cdc has jurisdiction over the activities of accounting Officers, i.e. individuals having the duty of managing public money and goods (e.g. treasurers, etc.).
Audit competences: Articles 81, 97, 100, 117 and 119 of the Italian Constitution (1948); Law No 20/1994; Law No 131/2002; Law No 266/2005; Law No 213/2012.
Jurisdictional competences: Articles 103 and 108 of the Italian Constitution; the code of accounting procedure contained in the Legislative Decree No 174/2016; Law No 19/1994; Law No 639/1996.
The CdC audits: ministries; public authorities and state agencies, including independent authorities; public funded bodies; regions, provinces, municipalities, metropolitan cities and the undertakings which are in-house service providers and private companies where the Italian state holds control.
TYPE OF SAI: A court of audit which discharges not only audit functions but also jurisdictional functions. In addition, the Cdc carries out advisory functions for the Government, the Regions, the Municipalities, the Provinces and the Metropolitan cities.
PLACE OF SAI IN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM: According to the Italian Constitution, the Cdc is autonomous and independent from the other powers of the State.
As an audit body, the Cdc reports to the Parliament on its audit results.
It exerts control and audit over the Government’s acts and management, with the aim of preserving lawfulness and the equilibrium of public finances.
In the event that acts by the executive do not comply with the law, the Cdc may issue a negative opinion which renders such acts ineffective.
The advisory function of the Cdc consists in giving opinions to Parliament and the Government to issue laws and administrative provisions. The opinion of the Cdc has to be acquired also for the review of the provisions related to the accounting system, the abolition or modification of the existing and the change or establishment of accounting models, documents and book entries.
ORGANISATION

Gender balance: 43 % men; 57 % women. Average age: 54
BUDGET: 310 million euros, 0.01 % of total governement budget.
AUDIT WORK
The Cdc independently defines an annually approved general audit plan. The audit plan covers audit policy and strategy and is approved by the United Chambers of Audit, since it contains reference criteria for Central Audit Chambers as well as indications for Regional Audit Chambers. Each Central and Regional Audit Chamber independently draws up its own audit plan.
The scope of the planning is identified on the basis of parameters such as financial relevance, considerable risks of irregularities, the results of previous audits, any requests from public authorities, human and technical resources.
The Cdc sends its annual audit plan to the Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and, at regional level, to the Presidents of the Regions and Regional Councils, as well as to the audited bodies.
The annual audit plan contains: the entities subject to Cdc’s audit activity and applied sampling criteria; the activities and issues subject to Cdc’s audit; the planning of the activities and the selected criteria and parameters.
The Cdc carries out: a compliance ex ante audit concerning acts that are exhaustively stipulated by law, with the aim of avoiding illegitimate action by the Government; a performance audit, aimed at increasing the efficiency of the administration and financial-economic audits.
The Cdc auditees have the right to respond to all findings before the final report is published.
To support this adversarial principle, the Cdc: informs the audited entities about its annual audit plan and provides them with information about the subject, terms, procedures and the planning of the audit; maintains a continuous and constructive dialogue with the different audited entities and the managers of the internal control offices; publishes its final report and presents its observations in the context of a public debate in the public session of the Audit Chambers.
For its performance audits, the Cdc publishes documents with evaluations, observations, and recommendations. The auditees must follow these recommendations to eliminate any issues encountered in the management of public finances and thereby guarantee sound management. They must also inform the Cdc about the measures undertaken following the Cdc’s recommendations.
OUTPUT
The Cdc informs the Parliament by means of: state annual reports; four-monthly reports on the expenditure laws (the cost involved in the laws); special hearings in which the Cdc presents its opinion on the Government’s economic and financial planning and on its financial bill; and specific reports on regional and local financing; a report on the coordination of public finance (annual); reports on public labour cost; reports on the management of EU funds and reports on the management of public bodies and entities.
The reports of the Cdc are published on its website.
The central control system is supervised by the General Accounting Department (at the Ministry of Economy and Finance) headed by the Accountant General.
Independent central accounting offices, belonging to the General Accounting Department in each ministry check that administrative action complies with the relevant financial laws and ministries’ directives. They check that expenditure commitments are lawful, approve them, and refer irregular transactions to the Minister, who can order the central accounting office to verify the transactions. Such cases are automatically brought before the Cdc.
The General Finance Inspectorate carries out on-the-spot examinations of the activities of ministries and public bodies, and can propose corrective action where necessary. It also ensures that the internal audit mechanism in each body is functioning correctly. The General Inspectorate’s reports are forwarded to the Accountant General and, where financial loss is detected, to the Cdc General Prosecutor, who can prosecute civil servants.

In accordance with the Law on the SAO, the SAO regularly informs the general public and citizens about audits performed, by publishing all audit reports and opinions on its website after they have become effective. The most common distribution channels for audit information are the official website of the SAO and public media – journalists and social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Publication of audit reports is always accompanied by press releases or press conferences. In some cases, when the audited topic is of heightened public interest, visually accessible and easily understood summaries of audit reports are prepared for use in further communication. In addition to the results of the audit, the public are also informed about progress on implementing the audit recommendations. This is mainly communicated via social media. The summaries of audit reports are available in English and Russian on the SAO website.
The SAO cooperates closely with the academic sector, e.g. with Stockholm School of Economics in Riga to introduce a certification system of public sector auditors in the Republic of Latvia.
The SAO is cooperating with private sector auditors and in particular the Latvian Association of Certified Auditors, continuously strengthening the system to effectively use the work of Certified Auditors within the SAO’s financial audits in municipalities.

The programme contains audits that must be carried out on the basis of the TCU’s legal mandate, own audit initiatives by the TCU and audits proposed by the Spanish Parliament (and, if within their scope, the Legislative Assemblies of the Autonomous Regions). The Plenum may add, modify, suspend or cancel audit tasks during the year.
The annual programme is published on the TCU’s website.
The TCU carries out: compliance audits to verify if the economic and financial management of the audited entity, activity or program complies with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions; financial audits, which aim to give an opinion on the reliability of information supplied by the financial statements of an entity in terms of its relevance to the applicable principles, criteria and accounting standards; and performance audits, which aim to provide an assessment of all or a part of the operations, management systems and procedures of the audited entity, programme or activity in terms of its economic and financial rationale, and if it adheres to the principles of sound management.
If different types of audit are combined, we can refer to: regularity audits, which focus on the objectives of compliance and financial audits; or comprehensive audits, which cover all the types of audit referred to above.
The TCU also carries out follow-up audits, which are targeted exclusively at verifying the degree of compliance with recommendations issued by the TCU in previous audit reports.
In addition to this, the TCU carries out horizontal audits, in which it audits several entities within the same public sub-sector, or different sub-sectors, with common characteristics and the same objectives and time range.
OUTPUT

They are also forwarded to the national government, the Governing Councils of the Autonomous Regions or the plenary sessions of local authorities, as appropriate.
Once it has been analysed by the Parliament, the audit report, together with the resolution adopted by the Joint Committee, is published in the Official State Gazette (and, where appropriate, in the Official Gazette of the Autonomous Region).
The TCU also publishes press releases on its website to provide quick access to the latest information on the TCU’s reports and documents.
In addition, a quarterly bulletin is published, containing information on TCU activity.
The TCU closely coordinates its activities with the External Audit Bodies that have been created in some Autonomous Regions.

Its audit portfolio also includes entities with large complex commercial activities such as the BBC, Network Rail and UK Asset Resolution Ltd.
The Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 makes the Comptroller and Auditor General responsible for the preparation, publication and maintenance of the Code of Audit Practice. The Code sets audit standards for some 950 local authorities and local National Health Service (NHS) bodies, and around 10 000 smaller bodies such as town and parish councils. The NAO also reports on the value for money of public spending locally, under the Local Audit and Accountability Act.

The NAO supports the C&AG in meeting his or her statutory responsibilities. The C&AG is an Officer of the House of Commons and a Crown appointee. Both the C&AG and his staff are independent of government.
The NAO supports Parliament in holding government to account, supporting in particular the Public Accounts Select Committee, other select committees and individual Members of Parliament in the scrutiny of public spending and delivery. The NAO is accountable to Parliament via the Public Accounts Commission. The Public Accounts Commission’s principal duties are to examine the NAO’s annual budget and lay it before the House of Commons, to consider the NAO’s strategy, to appoint the NAO’s external auditor, to receive their reports and to appoint the non-executive members of the NAO Board.
ORGANISATION
COMPTROLLER & AUDITOR GENERAL (C&AG): Mr Gareth Davies was appointed on 1 June 2019.
The C&AG is the also the Chief Executive and Accounting Officer of the NAO. The C&AG has extensive statutory rights of access to information held by a wide range of public sector organisations. The C&AG’s inspection rights extend to the records of many contractors to central government and those who receive public money from the entities he or she audits. To preserve his or her independence from government, the C&AG has complete discretion in carrying out his or her functions. Responsibility for all audit opinions and judgements rests with the C&AG alone.
TENURE: The C&AG is appointed for a ten year fixed term of office which is non-renewable. The C&AG can only be removed from office by the Crown on an address by both Houses of Parliament. The C&AG may not be a Member of Parliament, a member of the House of Lords, or hold any office under the Crown. During his tenure, the C&AG is a permanent member of the NAO Board.
SELECTION METHOD: The C&AG is appointed by the Crown following an address by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons supported by the Chair of the Public Accounts Parliamentary Select Committee.
The NAO is governed by a Board consisting of five non-executive members and four executive members, including the C&AG.
The NAO’s governance arrangements have been developed and implemented in accordance with the requirements of the Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011. The arrangements reflect the NAO’s unique statutory position and Parliament’s wish that the NAO’s governance should provide effective oversight of NAO operations, while preserving the C&AG’s independence in making audit judgements.
The NAO Board has a majority of non-executive members including the Chair. The Public Accounts Commission appoints the non-executive members and the NAO Chair is appointed by the Crown upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister and the Chair of the Public Accounts Select Committee. This ensures that the non-executive members are independent of the NAO’s management and have the confidence of the government and the opposition in Parliament.
The relationship between the NAO Board and the C&AG is set out in a specific Code of Practice.

ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
The NAO structures its audit teams into six groups, known as clusters. Each cluster covers departments facing similar strategic issues, such as major infrastructure projects and programmes or local service delivery.
In addition a central cluster provides strategic input to the Leadership Team and expert advice on the quality of the NAO’s work and the value the NAO delivers to audited bodies and Parliament.
The NAO’s clusters are supported by six networks of experts. These are decentralised groups that work across the NAO. They have specialist skills and capabilities relevant to all clusters. By providing cross-organisational support, they make sure to target expertise consistently so that all audits and published outputs benefit from the full range of what they know. They also promote knowledge sharing and allow their staff to develop specialist skills. The areas of expertise covered by the networks include: commercial and contracting, corporate finance, digital, operations and process management, project and programme management delivery and methods, economics and statistics.

AUDIT WORK
The NAO’s work is derived from a three-year Strategy and the NAO’s three strategic objectives:
developing and applying knowledge: it carefully plans its work to meet the needs of Parliament and from this draw out the insights that are most likely to drive positive change across the public sector;
increasing its influence: it aims to improve wider awareness and opinion of the NAO, including those of MPs and the bodies it audits, such that it effects positive change and government is more likely to implement its recommendations and look to it as a source of guidance;
delivering high performance: it uses its funds cost-effectively and makes sure it gets the best from its people.
The NAO’s programme of work and balance of effort are carefully planned to produce the information needed to support Parliament in its scrutiny of public spending and to improve public services.
The NAO’s annual work programme is approved by the Leadership Team following extensive consultation with the clusters.
Each year the NAO identifies cases where its work or influence has contributed to better public services, or a financially quantifiable net benefit to the taxpayer. It refers to this as the NAO’s “impact”. The NAO’s 2017-2018 Annual Report highlights 13 case studies illustrating the wider impact of its work, for example improving patient access to general practice, local support for people with learning difficulties, and the working of the higher education market. These wider impact case studies have been approved by the bodies to which they relate.
The NAO’s financial audit work conforms to International Standards on Auditing (UK). Its financial audit work also complies with the relevant International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) established by the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Its value-for-money assurance work is more varied; it is consistent with the NAO’s value-for-money standards, while also being responsive to the needs of many audiences in government and Parliament. The NAO’s value-for-money standards are consistent with the Fundamental Auditing Principles of the ISSAIs and tailored to meet the specific requirements of the UK public sector environment.
For the NAO’s work to have the impact and influence required, it must uphold high standards of ethics and probity, and work within a framework of values that preserve audit independence. The NAO expects its staff to adhere to the relevant internal and external quality standards for its work.
The quality of the NAO’s financial audit and wider assurance work is subject to internal and external review.
OUTPUT
In 2017-2018 the NAO: certified 370 accounts covering more than 1.6 trillion GBP of public income and expenditure; published 65 major documents (value-for-money reports and investigations), including nine on the UK government’s preparedness for exiting the European Union; provided 108 responses to correspondence from Members of Parliament and 877 responses to correspondence from the public. It also responded to 87 enquiries under the Freedom of Information Act and published seven best practice guidance documents summarising insights from its work.
The NAO presents its major outputs to Parliament and publishes these on its website, as well as on a wide range of external communication channels.
The NAO engages widely with the accountancy and auditing professions, through the professional institutes, with other UK and international public audit bodies and through the NAO’s private sector framework partners. This helps the NAO share good practice and learn from other practitioners.
