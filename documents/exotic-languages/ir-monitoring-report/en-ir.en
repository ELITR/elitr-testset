INTRODUCTION
The responsibilities bestowed on me as An Coimisinéir Teanga by the Houses of the Oireachtas include the monitoring of the implementation of the Official Languages Act.
This aspect of my duties is central to the work my Office carries out as it gives me the opportunity to monitor, of my own accord, the range of duties placed upon public bodies under the Official Languages Act.
Prior to 2018 the majority of the Office's monitoring was focused on language schemes.
This was a sensible approach because the language schemes were the main mechanism used by the legislation to impose a legal obligation on public bodies to provide varied services in Irish.
It was therefore essential that regular monitoring was carried out on public bodies to ascertain how they were implementing the commitments made in their language schemes.
An evidence-based account was given in the Commentary on the Language Scheme System, issued in 2017, on how this system is now flawed.
The report showed that there was no systematic or comprehensive development of services provided in Irish as a result of the language scheme system.
Arising from the findings made in this report I made the decision to change the monitoring process of the Office and to direct more of the Office's resources towards monitoring other areas instead of focusing primarily on the language schemes.
I must reiterate that the legislation does not allow me to monitor any provision other than those of the Official Languages Act.
I believe that this should be dealt with as the new Official Languages Bill is enacted.
The current situation ensures I am unable to proactively monitor any provision to do with the status or use of an official language in other Acts such as the Education Act 1998, the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Broadcasting Act 2009.
Currently I am only able to deal with allegations of non-compliance through an investigation.
This is the second monitoring report that the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga has issued since its establishment.
A short account of the monitoring work has been given in the Office's Annual Report and information in summary form will be provided in this manner henceforth.
This report provides an account of the work concluded during the year in the following categories, which were recognised as priorities for 2019:
Implementation of the recommendations made in investigations
The use of the official languages on signage at heritage sites
Language commitments of four Education and Training Boards
The use of the official languages on signage at universities under the aegis of the National University of Ireland
Websites of local authorities
Gaeltacht commitments of local authorities
Language commitments of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners
Unimplemented investigation recommendations
It will be noted that the Office is still monitoring the progress on recommendations made in investigations that were completed some years ago.
It is especially regrettable to me that An Garda Síochána hasn't implemented all the recommendations from an investigation carried out in 2011.
The investigation concerned the implementation of the provision in subsection 33(2) of the Garda Síochána Act which states that the Garda Commissioner shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that members of An Garda Síochána stationed in a district that includes a Gaeltacht area are sufficiently competent in the Irish language to enable them to use it when carrying out their duties.
The efforts made to persuade An Garda Síochána to implement this are explained later in this report.
At this point it appears that the likely outcome of this lack of progress will be the laying of a report on the issue before the Houses of the Oireachtas, in accordance with the obligation placed upon me, when recommendations of an investigation have not been implemented after a reasonable period of time has elapsed.
Compliance grading
As a guide to the audit process my Office uses clear compliance criteria to make adjudications regarding compliance grading.
The grades referred to in this report are:
Full compliance
Compliance for the most part
Compliance to a certain degree
Noncompliance for the most part
Complete noncompliance
Acknowledgements
My officials and I greatly appreciate the cooperation provided to us by public bodies in the course of our monitoring and audit enquiries during 2019.

INVESTIGATIONS
An Garda Síochána
Background
An investigation in 2011 found that An Garda Síochána had breached the Garda Síochána Act 2005.
This finding resulted from members of An Garda Síochána who were not competent enough in Irish to enable them to use it with ease being stationed in a district with a Gaeltacht area in An Bun Beag / Doirí Beaga, [Gaoth Dobhair], Co. Donegal.
It was recommended as a result of the investigation of An Garda Síochána:
That the Garda Commissioner take every necessary step to ensure that Gardaí competent in Irish are deployed to Gaeltacht stations.
That the finding and recommendations of the investigation are not to be used as an excuse to reduce or slow the provision of an appropriate policing service for the area in question.
That An Garda Síochána implement an appropriate language testing system to assess the Irish language fluency of members when it is proposed that they may be stationed in a district with a Gaeltacht area, and
That An Garda Síochána examine if there were implications from the decision of this investigation in relation to all the districts of An Garda Síochána with Gaeltacht areas and, if there were, that these be addressed to ensure compliance with the statutory language obligations.
The audit work
Numerous communications have occurred between my Office and An Garda Síochána since the investigation.
Indeed, there were more communications with it in the context of implementing recommendations of an investigation than with any other public body.
It is regrettable that a better result is not evident from those efforts.
I had a meeting with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on 25 March 2019, and I sent him a letter on 15 April 2019 providing a summary of that meeting and outlining the actions required in order to finalise the case.
Eight actions, in total, were specified in that document.
On 25 June 2019 the Office was informed that a comprehensive document, in reply to An Coimisinéir Teanga's letter, had been forwarded to Garda management.
A note was sent to An Garda Síochána on 11 July enquiring when we would receive the reply.
A reminder was sent on 2 September when no reply had been received.
On 3 September 2019 an acknowledgement was received apologising for the delay and stating that the Human Resources and Personnel Development Office of An Garda Síochána understood the urgency of the matter and that a reply would be provided soon in respect of all the actions discussed at the meeting with Commissioner Harris on 25 March 2019.
An email was issued to An Garda Síochána on 20 September 2019 stating that almost 6 months had elapsed since the meeting of 25 March, and that the Office was still awaiting a response on the matter from An Garda Síochána.
It was explained that the apparent lack of progress on this issue was a matter of concern and that consideration was being given to the next steps to be taken in light of the lack of a full response from An Garda Síochána.
Quite a few contacts between my Office and the Office of the Garda Commissioner followed that, during which it was reminded that I am obliged to present a report on the subject to the Houses of the Oireachtas if no progress was shown on recommendations of the investigation.
A response, including an up-to-date report, was received on 5 November 2019.
In that letter, it was advised that the important obligations of An Garda Síochána to provide their services through Irish would be included in their ongoing change programme.
It was also stated that a Strategic Workforce Plan was being drafted at present for the period 2020-2022 and that an Irish language service which is fit for purpose would be included in this Strategic Workforce Plan.
It was stated in the letter that the Human Resources and Personnel Development Office of An Garda Síochána would ensure the inclusion of the demand to provide services through Irish in every internal promotional and lateral competition henceforth and that trainees with Irish will continue to be recruited from future competitions.
My Office examined the report provided, and it was compared with the actions requested in my letter of 15 April 2019.
Although a reply was given in relation to each of the actions requested in my letter, there was little evidence of action.
The majority of the cases were characterised by no timeframes, vagueness or conditional understandings.
On 22 November 2019 a clarification was sought from An Garda Síochána in relation to the number, as opposed to the percentage, of Gardaí who have Irish in Gaeltacht stations, and a reminder was issued on the matter on 12 December.
Despite receiving acknowledgements for both emails, no reply had been received by the end of April 2020.
Response
This Office sought additional information and clarifications once more from An Garda Síochána at the beginning of May this year.
We sought information in respect of any progress that had been made in regard to assessments, promotion of members of An Garda Síochána to Gaeltacht stations, analysis of members with and without Irish in Gaeltacht stations who are due to retire, arrangements in respect of Gardaí with Irish who come through the recruitment panel and the protocol in respect of special units.
A response was provided on 10 June.
I must, at this stage, examine fully the letter An Garda Síochána submitted to me, but the progress one would expect has not been achieved to date.
It was clear from the information provided that the number of Gardaí with Irish who are on duty in stations located in districts which have a Gaeltacht area has increased from 47 to 51 in the period since the investigation was carried out.
That is an increase of 4 since the recommendations of the investigation were made in 2011.
The number of Gardaí stationed in Gaeltacht areas has decreased from 114 to 98 during that same period.
Main finding
It is most unfortunate that the recommendations of the investigation made in 2011 have not been implemented.
It may be that this lack of progress will result in a report on the matter being put before the Houses of the Oireachtas.
I have an obligation to do this where I believe that recommendations of an investigation are not appropriately implemented within a reasonable period of time.
It would be difficult for anyone to argue that a reasonable period of time has not now elapsed.

Department of Education and Skills
I conducted an investigation in 2017 that had particular importance in relation to education through Irish.
The central role of Irish-medium education is recognised in the “Statement on the Irish Language 2006” and the “20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030”.
That approach is seen in the obligations and objectives in relation to Irish in the Education Act 1998, for example that parents' choice is heeded in respect of advancing students' linguistic and cultural requirements.
The investigation I conducted showed that provisions of this Act, the Education Act 1998, had been breached.
The linguistic objectives of the Act were not appropriately included in the process of appointing a patron for a new primary school to be located in the Drumcondra/Marino/ Dublin 1 school planning area.
The investigation recommended:
that the Department of Education and Skills re-examine the demand for multi-denominational education through Irish in the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 school planning area; and
that the statutory language requirements are complied with in future in the process by which a patronage is awarded.
I was satisfied when the Minister for Education and Skills announced, on 31 October 2018, that the new school to be based in the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 school planning area would be an Irish-medium school.
Discussions continued in relation to the second recommendation, above-mentioned, in relation to the patronage process and the Minister announced the results of the 2019 patronage process towards the end of February 2019.
It was not evident to me that the patronages were awarded in accordance with the recommendations made by the Department in response to the investigation.
I noted the following in particular:
Even with the inclusion of the new schools that were announced, two of the twelve areas involved would have no Gaelscoil provision.
It appeared to me a weakness in the process that no information was provided in the individual reports as to whether there were resources in the Irish-medium schools to cater for the extra demand in the area.
There was no analysis of the ethos in those areas either.
It was evident that the Department had changed direction from the recommendations presented to me previously in December 2017 and April 2018:
To review the patronage process in respect of parents' indications of Gaeloideachas as a choice by giving greater emphasis to proportionality.
A Gaelscoil and an English-medium school could possibly be provided within one school planning area, for example a 24 classroom school could be designated as an 8 classroom school and a 16 classroom school.
A shared solution like this would be achieved in cases where the number of preferences for a Gaelscoil achieved a certain proportion of the number of preferences for the patronage body receiving the highest number of preferences.
Although a benchmark was not provided, a sample result was given in the case of 35% being agreed.
I thought at the time that this approach being adopted by the Department was sensible, insofar as a methodology was being recommended which seemed to me would accommodate parents' wishes for Irish-medium education, even when that choice did not achieve the highest amount of preferences in the patronage process.
The Department advised that there had been a subsequent change of view as no 24 classroom school was to be established between 2019 and 2022 and that the result of the recent patronage process did not give a sufficient level of affirmation that there is demand for a viable, 8 classroom Irish-medium school.
The Department described the consultation process implemented by it and outlined the Project Plan that arose from that consultation, which included:
To investigate adding an appendix to the current policy in relation to establishing new schools.
In the case of schools to be established during the period 2020-2022, to examine the existing Irish-medium provision in the area.
Where there is no provision in the area for Irish, to predetermine the teaching language of that school as Irish-medium, unless this is not suitable or necessary.
In other cases, the teaching language would be decided after a patronage process.
To investigate adding an appendix to the policy in the case of areas where new schools are to be established in the period 2019-2022.
A decision would be made beforehand that at least one of those schools would be an Irish-medium school, unless there were specific local reasons why this would not be suitable or necessary.
If one of the 26 primary schools to be established in the period 2019-2022 is to be expanded to a 24 classroom school, following demographic review, that the possibility of delivering that school as a 16 classroom school and an 8 classroom school, with some shared facilities, will be explored on a pilot basis, where sites allow it.
One of the Department's most significant recommendations in this letter was that it be predetermined that Irish would be the language of education for a new school proposed in a school planning area which has no provision for Irish-medium education.
I accepted that this recommendation was worthwhile although I was disappointed with what I saw as backtracking from the recommendation put to me previously in this respect.
I had a meeting with the Department of Education and Skills in July 2019 in relation to the implementation of the recommendations of the investigation.
Notwithstanding that the changes were aimed at making better provision for Irish-medium education, I expressed the opinion that it was important that particular attention be given to the provision of Irish education-medium.
This should specially apply in cases and areas where sufficient demand is shown during the patronage process, but where it is not the choice of the majority.
I am hopeful that the work of the Department, as a result of the investigation, will have a positive effect on the provision of Irish-medium education in the country.

Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Eircode)
Background
This investigation was a particularly important one which concerned how the Eircode system used place names and people's names and surnames.
Indeed, this Office received more complaints on this subject alone than on any other single matter since the establishment of the Office.
The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources breached the statutory language requirement in respect of the implementation of its language scheme insofar as it concerns Gaeltacht place names.
The relevant section in the scheme is as follows:
Gaeltacht Place Names
The Department has put in place the necessary arrangements to ensure that official Placenames of Gaeltacht areas as declared by the Minister in the (Ceantair Ghaeltachta) Placenames Order 2005 will continue to be used as the default for corporate purposes, including, where appropriate, legislative, corporate and statistical purposes.
In this case, the statutory obligation falls upon the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and not upon Eircode itself or An Post, which distributed the Eircodes, as the Department is responsible for granting and regulating the contract.
Despite how strange it seemed that English place names were being used by a public body for people's addresses outside the Gaeltacht despite their wish that the Irish language place name be used, there was no legislative infringement.
This is yet another example of the inadequacy of the Official Languages Act in safeguarding a basic language right.
The same applied to the translation of people's names from their original language, Irish, to English.
I asserted at the time that “having one's identity recognised in one's official language of choice is a fundamental right”.
Recommendations
That it is ensured that due regard is given hereafter to language scheme commitments when the Department is agreeing a contract with a third party to deliver services.
That any other contract that was in progress in the Department at the time be examined in order to find out whether this finding has implications for any other contract.
That a report be submitted to this Office by 12 February 2016 giving a comprehensive overview in relation to the compliance status of the other contracts with the statutory scheme commitment concerning Gaeltacht place names.
That a comprehensive report be submitted to this Office by 30 June 2016 in relation to the progress made in updating the database on which Eircode depends, including analysis of any discrepancy in the use of Gaeltacht place names in An Post GeoDirectory (APG).
The monitoring process
The monitoring process of the implementation of the investigation's recommendations was initiated during 2016.
There has been much correspondence between my Office and the Department of Communications' officers since that time.
I reminded the Department in April 2019 that the relevant Gaeltacht place names should be in Irish only on the Eircode system in order to implement correctly the commitment in the scheme as well as the recommendations of the investigation.
I notified the Department that I am still receiving complaints from members of the public regarding private bodies using their addresses in English.
This is contrary to their wishes and is a result of using the Eircode system, due to the fact that Gaeltacht addresses are not on that system in Irish only.
At a meeting at the end of May the Office's interpretation of the statutory provision was confirmed, that is, that the relevant Gaeltacht place names should be in Irish only on the Eircode system.
A final response was sought within 30 days.
I received a response dated 24 June 2019, indicating that the Department had written to An Post, who own the IP rights of all the addresses used in the Eircode system (that is the numerical address used as an internet protocol for every address), requesting that it amend its address database so that every relevant Gaeltacht place name is in Irish only.
It was confirmed, as was mentioned earlier, that every address that the Eircode system provides is derived exclusively from the GeoDirectory database.
This database is made available to Capita under licence from An Post GeoDirectory (APG).
APG is a cooperative enterprise between An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland.
In November 2019 An Post asserted that English forms of Gaeltacht addresses cannot be removed from its database as they are required to ensure correct delivery of letters.
The reason given for this was that a good deal of people use English addresses in the Gaeltacht.
An Post stated that it has a statutory obligation under ComReg to adhere to certain distribution objectives and that this would be impossible without the English version of the addresses in its database.
We were informed that An Post is focusing on introducing technology for its postmen and postwomen so that in future a hand-held device could assist in recognising addresses.
The Department also notified us that gradual progress is being made in relation to updating the database on which Eircode depends, including analysis of any discrepancy between the use of Gaeltacht place names in APG.
The Department claimed in November 2019 that this matter was part of a wider question, that is, that there is no legal form or version of addresses in Ireland and that a significant disparity exists in the form used for English and Irish addresses alike.
The result of this was said to be that at least 35% of Irish properties do not have unique addresses.
It was also explained that an address in Eircode's database must correspond with the address in An Post's database.
Significant difficulties could arise in relation to delivering post to those customers if the addresses varied.
It said that Eircode does not have the option, therefore, of changing the addresses in its own database unilaterally, without reference to An Post's database.
The Department accepts that Capita - the body responsible for providing Eircode - is encompassed within its language scheme regarding the provision of new Eircodes to Gaeltacht regions once every quarter, only using the Irish address.
It was said that this includes the webtool Eircode/Finder, where the Irish form of the address will appear by default when searching Gaeltacht place names by address or by Eircode.
We would expect that only the Irish form would be used for “legislative corporate and statistical purposes” in any case for which the Minister has made a place names order.
We were informed that Eircode's website and the Eircode Finder website are available in Irish.
The Department stated that it was satisfied that its language scheme requirements were being met and that it is fulfilling the provisions relating to place name orders in the Official Languages Act.
It is apparent to me that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has made a genuine effort to achieve a solution in this case by attempting to get An Post to amend the addresses in its database so that every relevant Gaeltacht place name is in Irish only.
These efforts have been to no avail, however.
As a result, Gaeltacht place names continue to be used in English by Eircode.
The investigation showed that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is ultimately responsible for this.

2018 INVESTIGATIONS
Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine
An investigation found that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine had breached a statutory language obligation by advertising posts as general operatives in the Department's centres in the Gaeltacht, in Ros an Mhíl and in Dingle, without specifying a requirement for proficiency in the Irish language for these positions.
Main recommendation of the investigation
In the investigation report, I recommended that proficiency in Irish would be a requirement for any Department position based in their offices or centres in the Gaeltacht and that any testing of an applicant's ability in Irish would be based on a language testing framework.
The audit work
In June 2018, the Department proposed equality for both the Irish and English languages in all competitions where a position would be based in a Gaeltacht Office and that the Department would make every effort to ensure all recruits had competence in Irish in Gaeltacht offices from that point on.
In addition, the Department contacted the University of Maynooth about the language testing framework (TEG).
The University of Maynooth agreed to provide a testing service on proficiency in Irish to the Department as required.
Main finding
After examining the implementation of the recommendations made in the investigation, I am satisfied the Department has made arrangements to deal with this breach in legislation.
The Department accepted it has an obligation to include a language requirement for positions of this nature and in addition to this it will examine the Irish language competency of applicants for positions in the Gaeltacht henceforth.

Iarnród Éireann
An investigation carried out on Iarnród Éireann demonstrated that it did not have the appropriate or adequate systems in place to ensure adherence to the statutory duties under the Official Languages Act 2003 and the Transport Act 1950 regarding the use of official languages on signs.
The use of síntí fada on electronic reservation signs was also included in the investigation.
Main recommendations of the investigation
I made six recommendations in the investigation report, including that signs, subject to the investigation, be corrected within three months.
I also requested that systems, procedures and guidelines be put in place to ensure the signage Iarnród Éireann erects complies with the legislation.
The audit work
We are in regular contact with this organisation and we are monitoring whether it has satisfactorily implemented some of the investigation's recommendations.
I am disappointed the síntí fada are still not being displayed correctly on electronic reservation signs; this matter is still being discussed with Iarnród Éireann.
Iarnród Éireann has stated it will correct this but to date this has not fully happened.
Officials from my Office met with officials from Iarnród Éireann in January 2019 and a month later a commitment was made that the síntí fadawould be available on the reservation signs by 31 July 2019.
It is a matter of regret that this goal was not achieved.
In August 2019 Iarnród Éireann stated it was working on the seating reservation system and tests were to be carried out in September on the necessary software patch to integrate with the new system.
In November 2019 Iarnród Éireann committed to carrying out a full review of the signs included in the investigation and in December 2019 it stated it was working on this issue, and that tests had been carried out for some months.
It was said it was hopeful that this problem could be solved early in the new year.
It is a cause of concern that Iarnód Éireann has not yet confirmed that the appropriate arrangements have been made to ensure that síntí fada would be displayed correctly on reservation signs.
One of the recommendations in the Investigation Report was to ensure that procedures enabling this would be completed within three months of the issue of the report, by 23 November 2018.
In a final effort to see if there was any way to fulfil the recommendations, a meeting was organised in February 2020 between myself, the CEO and the Corporate Manager of the company, to discuss the implementation of the recommendations.
Main finding
It was stated at that meeting that the system in use by Iarnród Éireann is capable of accepting síntí fada on small letters, at present, and that an upgrade will be introduced to enable the system to accept síntí fada on capital letters, along with apostrophes, on the reservation signs.
The Office has not yet received an update confirming that this has been implemented.

Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government
An investigation found that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government breached two statutory language obligations when it published The National Planning Framework in English only initially and when it launched a website on the same matter, also in English only.
Main recommendation of the investigation
I made six recommendations in the investigation report, including that the Department would give my Office at least four weeks' advance notification of its proposed date of publication of any document that is subject to the relevant commitment in the language scheme.
This requirement will last for three years from the date the investigation report was issued.
The audit work
The Department informed my Office in December 2018 that the Department was to publish a ‘Consultation Document' during December.
Regarding the website -www.npf.ie - it stated it had managed to achieve quite a lot in its efforts in providing the static content in both Irish and English and it hoped to have this work finished soon.
In addition, we were informed that an advice note was issued to all Department staff in September to remind them of the Department's obligations when it comes to the Irish language.
In mid-December 2018 the Department stated it was to publish another ‘Consultation Document'in January 2019.
It was also stated that the static information on the website www.npf.ie was now available in Irish and English.
The Department informed my Office in April 2019, July 2019, October 2019 and January 2020 of the upcoming publication of various documents.
Main finding
I am satisfied that the Department is adhering to the recommendations I made and I thank it for its ongoing cooperation.

Dublin Port Company
A complaint was made to my Office in October 2017 regarding a significant sign in English only that was erected by Dublin Port Company on the East Wall Road, at the entrance to the port.
The structure erected by Dublin Port Company was a sign that comes under the remit of the regulations in respect of signs which issued under the Official Languages Act and therefore the sign should also have been provided in Irish.
Main recommendation of the investigation
In the recommendations of the investigation I directed that Dublin Port Company submit proposals to me within six weeks from the date of the report as to how it planned to comply with the requirements of the regulations.
If the proposals made were acceptable to me, I asked that they be implemented within six months.
The audit work
Dublin Port Company advised that the company's architect was to proceed with the company's proposal in respect of the sign and that a comprehensive answer on the matter would be provided to us within two weeks.
It also informed us that a proposal on compliance would be issued to my Office.
After several requests by my Office, Dublin Port Company provided a comprehensive proposal and a design statement to the Office in March 2019, where it outlined how it would comply with the language provisions that have been made under the regulations and erect the sign “Calafort Átha Cliath” on the East Wall Road.
In the same correspondence it informed us that the new sign in Irish would be situated on the corner of the new entrance road into the port on Sheriff Street, next to the current sign.
The “Calafort Átha Cliath” sign would be erected on a concrete structure that is situated in front of East Wall Road, and it would be the height of an average person and equal in size to the “Dublin Port” sign.
It also informed us that Dublin Port Company must apply for planning permission from Dublin City Council and that this process would take three months.
Once the planning permission is granted a public tendering competition must be carried out for the works in question.
This would also take approximately three months to conclude.
After I considered the proposal and the design statement, my Office wrote to the company in April 2019 informing it that I was satisfied with its planned approach.
My Office wrote to the company twice, in August 2019, seeking up-to-date information on the progress of this proposal.
We were informed that the company sent a preplanning submission to the Planning Section of Dublin City Council in relation to the sign in late May 2019.
In addition, we were informed that it intended making enquiries with Dublin City Council about the application.
Main finding
After further contact from my Office, Dublin City Port Company outlined a breakdown of what it had achieved to date and what it had proposed to do in January 2020.
It said the sign was to be built as part of the Point Junction Improvement Scheme.
Under that scheme the Council is creating a new road into the Dublin Port Company estate, opposite Sheriff Street, where it will be able to erect the Irish version, “Calafort Átha Cliath”, of the sign.
The company stated it hoped that Dublin City Council would make the planning application for this work in the first quarter of 2020.
A further communication from my Office in February 2020 reminded the company of the objectives I prescribed in the recommendations of the investigation.
The company was also informed that it was welcome to send any design for any signs to my Office and that we will be able to ensure if they comply with the legislation before being erected.

RTÉ
An investigation found RTÉ had breached the Broadcasting Act 2009.
The Act was breached due to the station not broadcasting a comprehensive range of television programmes in Irish or current affairs television programmes in Irish, as the legislation requires.
Main recommendation of the investigation
My main recommendation in this investigation was that RTÉ would prepare an implementation plan, to my satisfaction, to provide a comprehensive range of television programmes in Irish and current affairs programmes in Irish.
The audit work
RTÉ submitted this plan to me last summer.
Some to-and-fro followed, and towards the end of 2019 I had a meeting with the station's senior management to discuss the plan.
Main finding
The national broadcaster informed me it planned to increase the number of hours of programming provided in Irish on the station's channels from 123 hours in 2017 (the audited year of the investigation) to a minimum of 533 hours in 2020.
The most noticeable increase is the broadcasting of news programmes (the equivalent of 58% of the increase for 2020) on the RTÉ News Now channel and programmes for children and young adults (the equivalent of 28% of the increase for 2020) on RTÉ Junior.
In 2017, 6 hours of programmes for children were broadcast in Irish on RTÉ TWO compared to 50 hours in 2020.
That is an increase from 31 hours in 2017 to 100 hours in 2020 on RTÉ Junior.
In addition, a joint venture has been set up with TG4 so more of that broadcaster's programmes can be provided on RTÉ.
The Irish Programmes Section is to be reconstituted on a full-time basis with RTÉ proposing to broadcast more new programmes in Irish on RTÉ 1.
It is clear there is a rise in the amount of broadcasting hours and programmes in Irish on RTÉ.
But it must also be acknowledged that the organisation is coming from a very low level to begin with.
It cannot be confirmed at this point that a comprehensive range of programmes is being provided as the legislation requires.
Nevertheless, I recognise this could be achieved in the years ahead as the range of programmes being provided develops.
To that end, I have asked RTÉ to provide an account, later this year, of what it will have achieved, as well as information regarding the amount and range of programmes it proposes for 2021.

An investigation I carried out on Cork County Council found the Council used Google Translate to provide the Irish version of its website.
Main recommendations of the investigation
I made a recommendation that the use of the Google Translate system be discontinued for the purposes of providing content in Irish on the Council's website.
The other main recommendations included a request that the Action Plan being implemented by the Council to provide static content in Irish be revised and the content be uploaded incrementally as it was translated.
I also stressed the requirement to have arrangements in place to ensure that the content in Irish is kept up to date.
The audit work
My Office wrote to Cork County Council in March 2019 requesting the renewed version of the Action Plan being implemented to provide the static content on its website in Irish.
Towards the end of March 2019 my Office received an Action Plan from the Council.
Cork County Council provided additional information regarding a schedule of dates for the work required; furthermore, copies of the estimates it had received from several translation companies were also sent to us.
After requesting an account in May 2019 of the work carried out to date, an e-mail was received on the same date giving an update on the progress of the Irish version of the site.
Main finding
Regular correspondence took place between my Office and the Council on the implementation of the recommendations I made in the investigation.
We were informed in February 2020 that the static information on the County Council's website is now available bilingually.

The Abbey Theatre
This investigation pertained to signs in the Abbey Theatre that did not comply with the obligations of the regulations in respect of signage that come under the remit of the Official Languages Act.
Main recommendations of the investigation
I made a series of recommendations to deal with the range and classes of non-compliant signs.
I also recommended the English-only sign above the main door of the Theatre be amended by 30 June 2019, unless evidence was provided to my satisfaction that definite arrangements were made to demolish the Theatre building during 2020.
The audit work
In February 2019, the Abbey Theatre apologised for the delay in replying to my Office and stated it regretted that the level of co-operation I received was not of the level that would be expected.
We were informed that a signage company was employed by the Theatre to deal with all the issues raised in the report and that a progress report would be provided to my Office by the end of March 2019.
In May 2019, following correspondence from us in April, evidence was provided that the range of signage which was the subject of the investigation was now amended, except for the main sign outside the Theatre.
A meeting was arranged between myself and the Theatre Director to discuss the matter, in June 2019, and it was agreed that an Irish version of the sign would be erected outside the Theatre.
During July and August my Office enquired of the Theatre seeking extra details to obtain a definite deadline regarding the signage outside the main door.
Following correspondence and telephone contacts during September my Office was informed that the Theatre would obtain the tender from the designers on 27 September, and that it could provide my Office with a precise timescale at that time.
Main finding
My Office contacted the Theatre on numerous occasions and in January 2020 we received a letter informing us that an Irish version of the sign had been designed and would be erected in the spring of 2020.

SIGNAGE AT HERITAGE SITES
Summary
The Office of Public Works (OPW) is the main state body responsible for the operation of the country's heritage buildings and sites.
The OPW is responsible for a large number of heritage sites, parks, gardens, castles and other iconic sites in the country.
These include some of the most iconic sites such as Dublin Castle, Sceilg Mhichíl and the National Botanic Gardens.
During 2018 8,673,704 people visited the various OPW heritage sites1.
It is crucial, therefore, that signage at these locations gives the appropriate recognition to the Irish language and that it complies with the statutory language requirements.
The use of both official languages on signage is an important indicator to visitors of the existence and status of the country's two official languages.
It demonstrates that both languages are held in equal regard and is all the more relevant in sites that bear historic and heritage importance.
Certain obligations in relation to the use of official languages on stationery, signage and recorded oral announcements are placed upon every public body that comes under the Act.
One of the functions of An Coimisinéir Teanga is to monitor compliance with the Act's provisions.
Like last year, it was decided to audit the use of the official languages on signage at various heritage sites maintained by the Office of Public Works.
This year's audit was carried out on ten heritage sites located outside of Dublin.
The objective of this audit was to arrive at a general verdict on the level of compliance with the regulations that pertain to the signs being used.
External, internal, permanent and temporary signs were examined.
The results of the audit work showed that a satisfactory level of compliance was attained at most locations despite full compliance not being achieved in every case.
Overall, 784 signs were examined during the audit.
An overall compliance level of 75% was achieved by the sites examined, based on 662 signs, following correct enumeration of the number of signs falling within the scope of the audit.
The statutory obligation
The language obligations that public bodies must fulfil in relation to signs they erect or that are erected on their behalf are specified in the regulations of the Official Languages Act.
In general, the text on such signs must be in Irish or in Irish and English.
In cases where bilingual text is chosen, the text in Irish must precede the English text, be as prominent, as visible and as legible as the English text, and the letters in the Irish text must not be smaller in size than the letters in the text in English.
These regulations do not apply to road or health and safety signs that come within the meaning of their own respective regulations.
Any new sign erected by any public body, or erected on its behalf after 1 March 2009, must adhere to the regulations.
Additionally, certain dates are specified in the regulations by which non-compliant signs, erected before the regulations came into effect, must be amended.
Essentially, at this stage public bodies should not have any signs in English only in use, bar those which come under the exemptions stated in the regulations, and any signs that have an error in the text in Irish must be corrected.
After ten years of the implementation of the regulations, one would expect that measures and systems are established in public bodies to ensure the proper use of official languages on their new signs.
Equally, the issue of non-compliant signs that should be amended by this stage should have been addressed.

The audit work
In July 2019, a letter was sent to OPW giving advance notice that the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga intended to conduct an audit on the use of official languages on signage.
It was explained that the signs would be assessed in accordance with the obligations arising from the regulations made under the Act.
A timetable was given to OPW informing it of when the on-site audits would be undertaken, and written information was requested as to the procedures in place to ensure compliance with the regulations.
In the second stage of the process, the selected heritage sites were visited to conduct the audit on signs in use.
Photographs were taken of the various signs.
Following the examination of the heritage sites, on 29 January 2020 my Office issued a draft report of the audit's results to OPW along with examples of non-compliant signs.
We gave OPW an opportunity to provide us with any additional information it saw fit.
We also sought further information in relation to the status of bilingual signs that were non-compliant with the regulations.
In addition, we requested an account of any steps that OPW intended to take to address the non-compliant signs.
This information was submitted to this Office in a reply dated 3 April 2020.
Conclusions and main findings
Overall, 784 signs were examined at 10 different sites.
After excluding the signs that do not need to be amended at present from the total, as well as the class of signs which could not be confirmed whether they were erected before or after the regulations came into effect, a 75% level of compliance was achieved by the sites examined.
This is based on an examination of 662 signs.
The table below, “Signs per Location”, outlines the level of compliance and the number of signs examined at the various locations.
Having assessed the number of noncompliant signs at the various locations and having considered the type of non-compliance identified, we decided to award a “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory” rating to the various locations.
10.
Famine Warhouse 1848
The lowest level of compliance was found at the Famine Warhouse 1848.
Even though few signs were in use at the site, 65% of those examined were in English only.
The high level of non-compliance here shows a disregard for the obligations regarding the use of Irish language on signage.
35% Compliant
Conclusions
One of the functions of the Office of Public Works is to protect and conserve heritage sites.
Millions of people from this country and abroad visit these heritage sites every year.
Since the Office of Public Works is a public body for the purposes of the Act, it is obliged to comply with the provisions of the Act, including the provisions concerning the use of the official languages on signage.
The results of this audit reveal that at the time of the audit, 75% of the signs examined were in compliance with the requirements of the regulations.
It was particularly noteworthy that a substantial number of signs - 153 - were in English only.
The regulations demand that any pre-existing signs of this type be amended by 1 March 2013.
The Office of Public Works informed us in October 2019 that an office notice is sent to all the organisation's staff in which the legal obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003 are specified.
Staff were reminded to comply with these obligations in 2018.
Main recommendations
The main recommendations of the audit included:
Conduct a thorough examination of the signs erected by the organisation or on its behalf that were subject to this audit, from permanent signs to temporary signs, signs that are visible to the public and internal signs, to guarantee that they are in compliance with the regulations.
Prepare a work plan detailing an agreed timetable for amending any sign that does not adhere to the requirements of the regulations, and to submit such plan to this Office.
Issue regular reminders to staff responsible for erecting signs (temporary signs included) in relation to the requirements that must be observed regarding the regulations.
Prepare a template of common temporary signs that comply with the requirements of the regulations which staff may use.
An audit should be carried out on other sites not included in this audit to ensure that the regulations made under the Official Languages Act are fully complied with.
In the case of signs on which the public body's name appears first in English along with the logo, it should be guaranteed that the text in Irish appears first and that it is as prominent, as visible and as legible as the text in English.
The 2018 audit
Summary
The audit carried out in 2018 consisted of ten heritage sites located in Dublin.
During the audit, a total of 562 signs were examined and the audit found 320 of them (57%) to be in compliance fully with the regulations made under the Act.
At the time of the audit, a high level of compliance of over 75% was recognised in three of the locations examined - Pearse Museum, St. Stephen's Green and Rathfarnham Castle.
The lowest compliance rate was observed at the National Botanic Gardens, where under 20% of signs were compliant.
Sites examined during 2018
Garden of Remembrance
Dublin Castle
Rathfarnham Castle
St. Stephen's Green
Iveagh Gardens
National Botanic Gardens
Pearse Museum
Kilmainham Gaol
Farmleigh House and Estate
Phoenix Park Visitor Centre - Ashtown Castle
I held a meeting with the Commissioner of the Office of Public Works, John McMahon, on 18 September 2019 and afterwards information was requested in relation to the following matters: a)	An account of the progress that has been made since the audit to address and correct the non-compliant signs in accordance with the statutory language provisions. b)	An account of the system the Office of Public Works has in effect to ensure that any new sign erected is in compliance with the requirements of the regulations.
We received a report from the Office of Public Works on 3 April 2020 (see below).
That report informed us of the actions undertaken at the five locations which were awarded an unsatisfactory rating in 2018.
We are grateful to the OPW for the commitments given to rectify identified breaches.
Dublin Castle
We were informed that the signage was reviewed and that a new signage system is in effect which gives greater attention to the statutory language obligations relating to signage.
Every sign that was in English only has been taken down.
National Botanic Gardens
The generalised signs were changed subsequent to the audit.
All signs that were in English only have been removed.
We were notified that most signs are now compliant.
It is planned to run a tender competition in 2020, subject to the availability of finance, in order to implement a new signage system throughout the Gardens.
Iveagh Gardens
Every sign that was in English only has been taken down and new compliant signs have been put in their place.
The statutory language obligations have been communicated to the manager.
Garden of Remembrance
It was confirmed that every sign that was in English only has been taken down and new compliant signs put in their place.
The statutory language obligations have been communicated to the manager.
Phoenix Park Visitor Centre
The majority of signs at this site are compliant with the legislative language requirements pertaining to signage.
The manager has been reminded of the statutory language duties.
Commitment
The Office of Public Works states all new signs, replacement signs and temporary signs will be bilingual.
Some examples are given in Appendix A of the signs examined.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING BOARDS
Summary
An umbrella organisation, Education and Training Boards Ireland, was established under the Education and Training Boards Act 2013.
The country's Vocational Education Committees were dissolved, and 16 regional Education and Training Boards were founded on 1 July 2013.
Their principal objective is to promote the development of education, training and youthwork in Ireland.
It is necessary that the Boards fulfil their statutory language obligations, not only for the purposes of the Official Languages Act, but also to ensure that they operate in accordance with the State's policy on the Irish language in the education sector.
This audit involved examining four Education and Training Boards in relation to their compliance with their statutory duties under the Official Languages Act 2003.
An audit was carried out on direct obligations specified in the Act, on obligations under the regulations in relation to signage, stationery and recorded oral announcements, and on statutory commitments made in language schemes.
The results of the audit show that none of the four Boards examined were fully compliant with their statutory language obligations.
Although all public bodies have the same obligations pertaining to direct duties under the Act and requirements under the regulations, there are often disparities in the commitments given in various language schemes.
A high degree of commonality was observed, however, in the commitments made by the Education and Training Boards, except in the case of Donegal Education and Training Board.
As this Board's jurisdiction includes a Gaeltacht area, commitments in relation to the Gaeltacht are included in its scheme.
The statutory obligation
Direct obligations
Public bodies have an obligation to reply to communications, in writing or by electronic mail, in the official language in which the communication was received.
Public bodies must also ensure that any information provided to the public in general or to a class of the public in general, through the post or electronically, is in Irish or in English and Irish.
Public bodies must publish the following documents simultaneously in Irish and English:
Any document setting out public policy proposals;
Any annual report;
Any audited accounts or financial statements;
Any statement of strategy prepared under section 5 of the Public Service Management Act 1997;
Any document prescribed due to its major public importance.
The regulations
It is specified in the regulations that public bodies must provide stationery, signage and recorded oral announcements in Irish only, or in English and Irish, by certain dates.
The Education and Training Boards were established on 1 July 2013.
As the regulations were in effect at that time, the Boards had a responsibility to implement them from the start.
Language schemes
The language scheme system is outlined in the Act.
The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht requests that a public body prepare a draft language scheme and submits it to his or her Department within six months from the date of the request.
Public bodies give commitments in the draft scheme in relation to the services that will be made available in Irish or bilingually.
When the Minister confirms the scheme, the public body has a statutory duty to implement the commitments.
Each scheme has a three-year life cycle but remains in effect until the Minister confirms a new scheme for the public body.
The Minister has requested all Education and Training Boards to prepare and submit a draft language scheme.
At the time of publication of this report, the Minister had confirmed a language scheme with 12 Education and Training Boards.
A language scheme has yet to be agreed with each of the other four Boards, despite the initial request for a draft scheme to be prepared by 24 February 2014.
The audit work
As a first step in the audit process, a questionnaire was issued to the relevant Education and Training Boards in July 2019, seeking information in regard to the implementation of various sections of their language schemes and the direct obligations under the Act.
Comprehensive accounts in relation to the fulfilment of obligations were provided along with some samples of stationery and application forms as evidence.
All the replies and information provided were assessed and further information was requested of the Boards after the assessments.
Main outcomes
It was decided that an Education and Training Board could achieve one of five compliance grades, based on the adjudication of this Office and on the information provided in relation to implementing the statutory obligations.
The second highest grade was awarded to Donegal Education and Training Board after it illustrated that efforts were being made to fulfil all of its obligations.
An officer has been appointed to direct that work but a lack of progress was evident in regards to some obligations.
Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board was also evidently attempting to fulfil its obligations.
There were shortcomings in the implementation, however, in relation to publications, static content on the website, applying for a position through Irish and the appointment of an Irish Language Officer.
This Office's assessment is that the language scheme commitments and the direct obligations under the Act are being implemented only to a certain degree.
The result was the same in the case of Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, after some progress and additional commitments regarding the implementation of its language obligations were made during the audit.
In the case of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, it appeared to this Office, at the start of the audit, that no progress had been made towards implementing a range of language scheme commitments or obligations in relation to signage, stationery and publications.
Although a small amount of progress was achieved during the audit, non-compliant for the most partwas ultimately the final grade awarded to the Board.
It is a cause for concern to me, as An Coimisinéir Teanga, that a public body, let alone a body in the education sector, would disregard its statutory language obligations in the way that Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board has done.
I would expect that this non-compliance will be addressed in a systematic manner in the months ahead.
It should be mentioned that despite a draft report being issued in all cases, no response on the report had been received from one Board at the time this report was being published - Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board.
Matters relating to change of staff and the Coronavirus had a bearing on the delay, according to the Board.
A brief account is given below on the main findings of the audit and on the recommendations that were given in cases where obligations were not being fulfilled.
Direct obligations under the Act
Communication in writing
All the Education and Training Boards informed us that a translation service is available to them for the purpose of answering written communications in Irish when the recipient of the communication is not sufficiently competent in the language.
Most of the Boards stated that the language of communication does not impact the timeliness of the response.
Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board noted, however, that the timeliness of its responses depended on the number of words to be translated and on the complexity of the material.
The Boards were reminded that the service in Irish must be of equal standard as the service in English.
During the audit it came to light that replies in English were issued to members of the public who initiated correspondence in Irish with two of the Boards examined.
It was recommended that the proper systems be put in place to ensure that correspondence in Irish is answered in the same language and that a prompt response is issued in relation to complaints from my Office.
This audit was informed that none of the Education and Training Boards examined initiate the type of communication in relation to information in writing provided to the public in general or to a class of the public in general.
Publications
The high level of non-compliance evident in relation to implementing an essential requirement of the Act, that certain documents be published simultaneously in the two official languages, is a cause for concern to this Office.
Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board is the only Board examined that could confirm that such documents are being published in accordance with legislation.
In the other cases, Irish language editions of annual reports or financial statements were not being published appropriately.
Most of the Boards indicated that the main cause of the non-compliance in respect of publishing financial statements was that the template for those statements is supplied in English only by the umbrella organisation, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI), to the regional Boards.
It was a matter of concern for this Office that an Irish language version of this template was not available - six years after the public body was founded.
Some Education and Training Boards informed us that they were planning to translate the template themselves in order to ensure their legislative compliance.
It was apparent, however, that financial and resource savings could be made if this were carried out centrally.
My Office issued a letter to the umbrella organisation, ETBI, seeking clarity on the matter.
In a letter dated 15 June, ETBI advised my Office that the Department of Education and Skills had, in fact, designed the template, and that the Department had also provided an Irish version.
We were informed that ETBI had issued both templates, the Irish and English versions, to all of the Education and Training Boards in the country, and had advised them of their statutory obligation to provide the financial statements bilingually.
It was advised that there were some difficulties with the issue, but that ETBI was working continually with the Boards to achieve a resolution to those difficulties.
I am grateful to ETBI for its cooperation.
Obligations under the regulations
Stationery
Some samples of the stationery used by the Education and Training Boards were provided.
We received copies of compliment slips and headed paper and in most cases only minor amendments were required for the items of stationery to be compliant with the regulations.
For example, it was noticed that the name and slogan of the public body was in English only on the compliment slips used by Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, and that the English text came first in other parts.
Corrected versions were provided after we raised the matter with the Board.
Signage
There was great disparity in the progress made by the various Education and Training Boards in relation to signage.
Donegal Education and Training Board informed us that it had completed a full audit of its signage and samples of diverse compliant signs were provided as validation.
Even though Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board had completed its own audit, it appeared that only the Board's main signage was included, that is, signs featuring the name of a school or centre.
It was evident, from pictures provided and from signs erected in the venue of the meeting we held with the Board, that there were signs at various centres that were not in accordance with the legislation.
In the Board's response to the draft report, however, it was advised that an audit was underway on the matter and samples were provided of signs in the meeting venue that had been corrected in the interim.
It was recommended in such cases that a full audit be carried out and a phased plan put in place, to ensure the relevant signage is in accordance with legislation.
Recorded oral announcements
Many of the recorded oral announcements examined were not compliant with the Regulations.
In some telephone messages that were tested, only the greeting and the acknowledgment at the end of the messages were in Irish, despite the requirement that the same information be provided in both languages.
Checks were carried out again after those dates.
No significant change in approach was detected.
The Office will return to this matter in due course.
Language scheme commitments
All of the language schemes analysed in this audit were confirmed during the period between February 2017 and October 2018, and each of them was a first scheme.
The audit began in July 2019.
The table below highlights the commonality that was evident in the fundamental elements of the commitments made in the language schemes although there was a good deal of variation in the specifics of the commitments.
For example, Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board committed to providing all live announcements bilingually.
The figure for live announcements was 20%, however, in the case of Donegal Education and Training Board and 10% for Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board.
Communications with the public
There are many ways in which the Education and Training Boards communicate with the public.
Statutory commitments are given in the language schemes aiming to normalise and promote the use of Irish in those methods of communication.
In relation to telephone communications, a commitment is made in every scheme that, at the very least, callers are greeted in Irish in the first instance or are given the name of the organisation in Irish before in English.
After carrying out several tests, however, full compliance was not evident.
The most serious non-compliance in this field of the audit concerned application forms for teaching positions provided through the online system eRecruit.
This system was being employed by Education and Training Boards who committed to provide Irish versions of every application form, the most used forms or forms pertaining to Gaelcholáistí.
In order to make an application, one must register with eRecruit, but the registration system is provided in English only.
As a result, applications cannot be made in Irish for teaching positions.
I understand that the issue of the application forms has been raised by the Boards with the external company that provides the eRecruit system and that the issue has been raised nationally.
It appears to us that a provisional arrangement should be put in place in which applications through Irish are accepted outside of the eRecruit system, until the matter is resolved.
It was recommended that such an arrangement be put in place for applicants who wish to apply through Irish and that this be made known proactively.
Information technology
Every Education and Training Board included in this audit committed to providing the static material on its website bilingually.
While a good deal of progress was evident from the assessments carried out of the websites, it was clear, overall, that there were flaws and inaccuracies on the Irish sites and that the material on the English and Irish sites did not correspond.
In the case of Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, the machine translation system Browsealoud was employed to provide the static material in Irish.
It was recommended that a professional translation of the static content of the website be carried out, and that it be uploaded within a specified period.
Recruitment, training and development
Each of the Education and Training Boards confirmed that the appropriate resources and opportunities are provided to members of staff who wish to develop their proficiency in Irish.
Donegal Education and Training Board and Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board indicated that they had carried out a survey to gauge the competence of their staff in Irish as well as the level of interest for proposed Irish language classes.
Donegal Education and Training Board's Coiste Gaeilge is running an in-service course for mathematics teachers, along with conversation classes for the administrative team.
Monitoring
A commitment is given by all of the Education and Training Boards examined to establish a formal system to monitor requests for Irish language services and to give an account thereon in the Annual Report.
No such account was given in Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board's Annual Report for 2018.
It is apparent that no suitable monitoring was being undertaken by this Board in relation to the implementation of the language scheme commitments or the direct obligations under the Act.
A formal monitoring system, as recommended, would be required to ensure that these statutory requirements are implemented appropriately.
Capacity to implement commitments
Public bodies must ensure that a sufficient number of staff is available to fulfil their language scheme commitments and direct obligations.
The table below indicates the number of the Education and Training Boards' administrative staff that are considered to be competent in Irish.
Each Board gauged competence in Irish using disparate criteria and this must be considered when examining the figures below.
Conclusion
Donegal Education and Training Board informed us that it intends translating its financial statements internally and that the Irish version will be published simultaneously with the English version in future.
We will be advising the Board of the response received from ETBI.
The same Board is continuing its correspondence with eRecruit in relation to supplying application forms bilingually, but it has advised that applications completed in Irish will be welcomed in the interim.
Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board has committed to provide a provisional arrangement for those who wish to make an application through Irish outside the eRecruit system.
Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board has stated that a professional translation will be carried out on the static content on its website by the end of July 2020 instead of utilising a machine translation tool.
Kildare and Wicklow Training and Education Board advised that it accepted the Office's recommendations and laid out a clear timetable for the implementation of those recommendations, by the end of the current year.
The recommendations that an appropriate system be put in place to respond to correspondence in the official language in which it is received, and that a timely response be provided to complaints from this Office, are to be implemented immediately.
Some examples are given in Appendix B of the websites examined.
SIGNAGE AT THIRD LEVEL INSTITUTIONS
Summary
We examined the way in which the four universities, under the auspices of the National University of Ireland,
National University of Ireland, Galway
University College, Cork
University College, Dublin
National University of Ireland, Maynooth were complying with the requirements for the use of the official languages on signage.
The objective of this audit was to come to a general opinion on the level of compliance of the signage used by the relevant third level institutions.
A wide range of signage is generally used by universities at their various campuses.
To get a general overview in relation to the level of compliance, some sample sites were chosen where the signage used was examined.
No advance notice was given in relation to the sites to be examined.
External signs, internal signs, permanent signs and temporary signs were included in the audit.
The statutory obligation
The language obligations to be fulfilled by public bodies in relation to signs erected by them, or erected on their behalf, are specified in the regulations under the Act.
In accordance with the regulations, a public body is permitted to choose Irish only for use on signage, or Irish and English.
Where bilingual text is chosen, it is essential that the clear criteria set out are adhered to, namely:
the text in Irish shall appear first;
the text in Irish shall be as prominent, visible and legible as the text in English;
the letters in the text in Irish shall not be smaller in size than the letters in the text in English;
the text in Irish shall communicate the same information as the text in English;
a word in the text in Irish shall not be abbreviated unless the word in the text in English, of which it is the translation, is also abbreviated.
These regulations do not apply to road signs or to health and safety signs to which other regulations apply unless there is an exemption.
After 1 March 2009, any new sign erected by a public body or on behalf of a public body must comply with the regulations.
Certain dates are specified in the regulations whereby any non-compliant signs erected before the regulations came into effect must be amended.
Public bodies should not have any signs erected in English only at this time, except those that come under the exceptions stated in the regulations.
It is also a requirement that any sign with an error in the Irish text is corrected.
In addition to the statutory language requirements on the country's universities under the Official Languages Act, additional duties are placed on them under the Universities Act 1997.
One of the university objectives in that Act is:
12. (e) “to promote the official languages of the State, with special regard to the preservation, promotion and use of the Irish language and the preservation and promotion of the distinctive cultures of Ireland”
It is necessary, therefore, that the signs erected by a university comply with the regulations for the sake of the visibility and promotion of Irish in the education and research centres.
Bilingual, compliant signs illustrate to the university's community and to visitors the existence and status of the two official languages.
The audit work
In April 2019, a letter was sent to the Presidents of the four universities giving advance notice that the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga was to carry out an audit in relation to the use of official languages on their signage.
It was indicated that the signs would be assessed against their level of compliance with the relevant regulations under the Act.
We wrote again to the relevant universities in July 2019, seeking information in relation to the following matters:
What system does the University have in place to ensure that any new signs erected comply with the requirements of the regulations?
An account of any steps taken by the university to date to ensure that any signs erected prior to the enactment of the regulations and which should have been amended before 1 March 2012 or 1 March 2013, have been amended.
Did the University undertake an audit on signage at any time since the enactment of the regulations in order to assess the compliance level?
Each university replied to the request.
Subsequently, the universities were visited in August and October 2019 to conduct a visual audit of the signs in use and some photographs were taken of the different signs.
We then wrote to the universities and provided them with a draft report on the results of the audit; this resulted in a recommendation that a work plan be drawn up in which an agreed timetable would be specified for amending any signs not in compliance with the requirements of the regulations.
As a concluding step, my Office issued the final report to the Presidents of the universities in spring 2020.
Conclusions and main results
A wide range of signs was examined, including external signs, internal signs, permanent signs and temporary signs.
For the most part, the signs used in the universities were directional and informational signs.
Different levels of compliance were applicable to each university, but overall just over half of the signs examined were fully compliant with the legislation.
In 41% of the cases examined, the text on signs was in English only.
This category comprised of temporary signs, for the most part.
These are signs which could be easily amended, and it highlights the importance of having the correct systems in place to ensure these types of signs are in accordance with the requirements of the regulations.
Another matter that came to my attention was that the name of the University was displayed in English only by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, along with the University's logo.
The approach and view of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth in regards to this matter is very disappointing.
This is in light of an investigation I conducted on the University in 2016 which found that the University had breached the legislation by having the name of the public body in English only on its headed stationery and signage.
Under the regulations, a public body is permitted to use Irish only, or Irish and English, on its headed stationery and on signage.
If it chooses the bilingual approach, very clear criteria are set out in the regulations regarding the way that option is implemented.
The regulations allow for an exemption in regard to a logo but the exemption does not extend to the name of the public body.
The National University of Ireland, Galway and University College, Cork gave priority to the English version of the name of the public body in relation to the logo on signage.
It was suggested in every case that priority be given to the Irish version of the name of the public body on signs erected by the public body and to ensure that they are in accordance with the regulations.
Main Recommendations
Some of the main recommendations of the audit include:
Prepare a work plan and submit it to this Office detailing an agreed schedule for amending any signs not meeting the requirements of the regulations.
Undertake an audit of the signage at the other buildings not included in this audit.
Prepare a programme to address non-compliant signs found in other locations on university campuses.
Issue a reminder to staff responsible for erecting signs (including temporary ones) in relation to the requirements that must be met with regard to the regulations.
Prepare a template of common, temporary signs which meet the requirements of the regulations and which could be used by staff.
In the case of signs in which the full name of the University is featured along with the logo, it should be ensured that the text in Irish appears first and is as prominent, as visible and as legible as the English text.
That the National University of Ireland, Maynooth implements the findings and recommendations made in the formal investigation carried out in 2016.
A brief summary of the various universities
National University of Ireland, Galway
The National University of Ireland, Galway was visited on 24 October 2019 to undertake an audit of the signs in use by the University.
The audit encompassed a wide range of signs at ten buildings across the University.
412 signs in total were examined and the results showed that 280 signs (68%) were fully compliant with the regulations.
The table below outlines the level of compliance and the number of signs examined.
During the process, we noticed, in some cases, that the National University of Ireland, Galway gives priority to the English language name of the public body (National University of Ireland, Galway) when used alongside the logo on signage.
The regulations allow for an exemption in the case of a logo, however the exemption does not apply to the name of the public body.
Priority should be given to the name of the public body in Irish.
There was a significant number of signs, 28%, in English only.
More than half of the non-compliant signs related to temporary ones.
These are signs that can be easily amended, and it highlights the importance of having a system in place to ensure that these types of signs comply with the regulations.
With regard to the non-compliant, bilingual signs, these are signs not fully in compliance with the requirements in the regulations in relation to text in Irish, i.e. priority given to text in English, the English text in bold print.
The University submitted a work plan to this Office in relation to the noncompliant, bilingual signs detailing an agreed schedule for amending any sign not adhering to the requirements of the regulations.
The system in place within the University
In correspondence received from the University in September 2019, it was stated that two primary means are used to ensure compliance with the requirements of the regulations when any new signs are erected.
It was stated that the Office of the Secretary sends periodic circulars to all University staff in which the statutory requirements of the University under the Act and under the language schemes are detailed.
A link to the Act's handbook is provided in the circulars; a copy of the latest circular was given to this Office.
It was stated that the Translation Service of the University functions under Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge and caters for the language requirements of the National University of Ireland, Galway.
The service provides specialised advice and a translation service for staff of the University to ensure the University complies with its statutory requirements in relation to bilingualism.
This includes the requirements in relation to signage.
We were advised that when a sign needs to be translated or proofread, that the translators ensure the sign complies with the regulations.
Advice/expertise is sought, in some cases, when required.
Steps taken by the University to amend signs whenever a complaint arises and when an audit is undertaken to monitor the compliance level were also referenced.
The University made it known it understands this monitoring work on signage throughout the University campus is ongoing work, and it is continually striving to ensure every effort is made to comply with the regulations in relation to signage and the Act.
University College, Cork
A wide range of signs in use on the campus of University College, Cork were examined during a visit in October 2019.
517 signs in ten of the University's buildings were examined.
The bilingual text on 47 signs was not in accordance with the regulations, but as these were erected prior to 1 March 2009, they do not need to be amended until 1 January 2026.
This meant that 470 signs could be assessed in relation to compliance levels.
Of those 470 signs, 56% of the signs were in compliance with the statutory requirement.
The table below outlines the level of compliance and the number of signs examined.
During the process, we noticed, in some cases, that University College, Cork gives priority to the name of the public body in English (University College Cork, Ireland)where it appears alongside the logo on signage.
The regulations require headed stationery and signage erected by the public body to be in Irish, or in Irish and English.
The regulations allow for an exemption in the case of a logo but that exemption does not apply to the name of a public body.
The Irish version of the name of the public body should be given priority.
The University should ensure that no more signs giving priority to the English name of the University are erected.
Regarding signs in English only (37%), the regulations require that any old signs of this type are amended by 1 March 2013.
Over half of the non-compliant signs related to temporary ones.
These are signs which could be easily amended and it highlights the importance of having the correct systems in place to ensure these types of signs comply with the requirements of the regulations.
The chart below outlines the various levels of compliance in relation to the signs examined as part of this audit.
University College, Cork
The system in place within the University
We were provided with a step-by-step account of the system put in place by University College, Cork to ensure that any new signs erected comply with the requirements of the regulations.
When the Buildings and Estates Office receive an application for the suggested text/graphics, that text is sent to Ionad na Gaeilge Labhartha to be checked or translated.
The signs are ordered after the Buildings and Estates Office reviews/approves the subject matter.
The Buildings and Estates Office checks the subject matter prior to the sign being erected.
It was stated that ongoing monitoring takes place in the Buildings and Estates Office and in the Office of Corporate and Legal Affairs along with other officers/units in the University with a role in implementing the Official Languages Act in relation to assessing the compliance level of new signs.
When signage is identified as not being in accordance with the regulations, steps may be taken to amend the situation.
University College, Dublin
University College, Dublin was visited in October 2019 and 328 signs in ten of its buildings were examined.
The results showed that 133 signs were fully compliant with the statutory language requirements.
The table below outlines the level of compliance and the number of signs examined.
It should be taken into consideration that the signs examined may have different levels of non-compliance.
The number of signs in English only (52%) was a matter of surprise and disappointment.
Almost half of the noncompliant signs were temporary signs.
These are signs which could be easily amended and it highlights the importance of having the correct systems in place to ensure these types of signs comply with the requirements of the regulations.
With regard to the range of signs that were bilingual, for the most part, but were not fully compliant with the requirements of the regulations in relation to Irish text these signs may not need to be amended until 1 January 2026 if they were erected before the regulations came into effect.
Clarification was sought from the University in regard to this range of signage and the extra information requested was received.
That is included in the table above.
The chart below outlines the various levels of compliance in relation to the signs examined as part of this audit.
University College, Dublin
The system in place within the University
The University stated in September 2019 that the requirements of the regulations are taken into consideration when designing and detailing signs for restoration projects and directional signs.
The University informed us that non-compliant signs erected before the implementation of the regulations were remedied during the restoration work or after completed audits.
The University undertook a survey of signs in 2014 as part of a project in relation to a strategy for directional signage.
It was stated that another survey is proposed for this year and that an annual audit into external signs is undertaken as part of the ongoing programme.
National University of Ireland, Maynooth
Twelve of the University's buildings were visited and 361 signs in total were examined.
The bilingual text on 64 signs was not in accordance with the regulations.
The University authorities stated that these signs were erected prior to 1 March 2009, thus they do not need to be amended until 1 January 2026.
Accordingly 297 signs could be assessed in relation to compliance levels.
Over half (63%) of the signs were in breach of the statutory language obligation.
The table below outlines the level of compliance and the number of signs examined.
During the process, we noticed the name of the University is shown in English only as ‘Maynooth University National University of Ireland Maynooth' on the University's logo.
The logo with the English text is in use on some signs that were fully bilingual, except for that text.
The use of the University's name on a logo is a matter that this Office examined by way of a formal audit in 2016.
A finding was made then that the University's name on signage or stationery, in English only, contravened the legislation.
It is clear the recommendations of the audit were not implemented and I am looking at the further steps I can take in light of the disregard which seems to have occurred in relation to the recommendations of the statutory audit.
At the time of the audit, more than half of the signs (54%) erected throughout the campus were in English only.
The high number of this type of signs shows the negligence of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth in relation to its compliance with statutory requirements for signage.
In correspondence received on 11 June 2020 from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth a commitment was given by the University that all the signs will be corrected by 1 September 2021.
Furthermore, a work plan and a timetable were submitted to the Office to ensure that the signs would comply with the requirements of the regulations by that date.
The National University of Ireland, Maynooth informed us that the issue of displaying the name of the public body in English only along with the University's logo has not yet been resolved, resulting in difficulties as regards the signage; the issue will therefore have to be discussed within the organisation.
The chart below outlines the various levels of compliance in relation to the signs examined as part of this audit.
The system in place within the University
We were informed that Oifig na Gaeilge works closely with the offices and other departments of the University to ensure that any new sign erected by the University is in compliance with the regulations.
We were informed also that Oifig na Gaeilge provides the translation as required and that the proofs are checked before the signs are confirmed.
It was stated also that Oifig na Gaeilge developed an information leaflet, in 2016, entitled ‘Eolas Tábhachtach do Bhaill Foirne'to summarise the requirements of the Act.
An explanation regarding regulations for signage was included.
We were told that Oifig na Gaeilge is working on preparing the necessary translations for the signage which is to be changed or updated.
It was said that this is an ongoing project because specific signs are at issue and that it takes time to review each one of them.
Conclusions
Public bodies have a statutory responsibility to ensure their stationery, signage and recorded oral announcements are provided in Irish only, or in Irish and in English, in accordance with the specific criteria set out in the regulations.
The universities are public bodies under legislation who use their signage to provide information to staff, students and visitors.
The organisations have a language obligation, not only under regulations under the Official Languages Act, but also under the Universities Act 1997.
In the case of three universities we examined, priority was given to the name in English of the public body on signage, even though the regulations specify that priority must be given to Irish text.
An account on the compliance level and the number of signs examined is given in the table ‘Signs per university' below.
It should be considered that various non-compliant levels may be included in the signs examined.
There were some cases where bilingual signs, for the most part, were in use, but were still not fully compliant with the regulations regarding Irish text.
In other cases, signs were in English only, regardless of the fact those signs should have been amended by 2013.
Table: Signs per university
On completion of this investigative process, it was clear to this Office that just over half of the signs, 53% in total, were in compliance with the regulations under the Act.
It is clear from the audit carried out by my Office that there are still failings in the approach taken by the universities examined in their dealing with non-compliant signs.
By this time, it would be hoped that arrangements would be in place to ensure the statutory language requirements are complied with when erecting signage.
Appendix C contains some examples of the signs examined.
LOCAL AUTHORITIES' WEBSITES
Summary
An audit was carried out into the implementation of commitments, made by ten local authorities, in relation to the use of Irish on their respective websites which included commitments to provide interactive services in Irish, in those cases where such commitments were made.
It was found that none of the ten local authorities examined this year were fully compliant with the commitments they provided in relation to their websites and interactive services.
Two local authorities, Longford County Council and Mayo County Council, achieved the second highest compliance rating.
The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has agreed a language scheme with each of the 31 local authorities in the country, with the exception of Tipperary County Council.
The Minister requested Tipperary County Council to prepare a draft scheme in 2015, but a scheme has yet to be confirmed.
Every one of those schemes contains a commitment relating to the provision of material or electronic services in Irish.
There is significant disparity, however, in the types of commitments made in the various language schemes.
The results of the audit show that only one local authority, Galway City Council, committed to provide a fully bilingual website.
Another two committed to providing static content in both official languages and in the remaining cases, commitments were made to make some pages available in Irish.
Websites are important information and communication resources in the public sector.
They are used extensively to provide information and essential services to the public in general.
It is often the case that websites act as the first point of reference availed of by citizens when accessing information or services.
Public bodies use online services to provide the public with an important range of services, and it is desirable that these be provided in both official languages.
It is on this basis that obligations relating to websites are considered when confirming language schemes.
The statutory obligation
The statutory guidelines issued under the Act set out the objective that a commitment in a language scheme relating to the public body's website should have.
It is recommended in the guidelines that any information aimed at the public be made available bilingually:
“The objective is that any internet information services, including general information about the organisation's activities, which are directed at the general public should be made available in both languages.”
The guidelines also contain a reference to interactive services, stating that any new services of this nature must be introduced bilingually.
This is expressed as being an essential requirement.
The audit work
This audit encompasses the second year of a monitoring project set out last year, with the objective of assessing how local authorities are fulfilling their commitments in relation to their websites and online services.
The following factors were taken into consideration in deciding on the language schemes to be audited during 2019:
the period of time since the first language scheme was agreed by the local authority
the period of time since the latest language scheme was agreed
the type of scheme (first scheme, second scheme etc.)
whether a Gaeltacht region is included in the remit of the local authority
The following language schemes were selected for audit:
* Galway City Council agreed its fourth language scheme with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht during the audit and therefore, the audit was based on the third scheme.
In July 2019 a letter giving advance notice of the audit was issued to the Chief Executives of the ten local authorities.
Enclosed was a form detailing the relevant commitments in their respective language schemes regarding their websites and interactive services.
They were requested to provide details of their organisation's compliance with those commitments.
This Office examined the websites, tested the online services and adjudicated on how effectively the commitments contained in the language schemes were being implemented.
Additional questions were issued to the local authorities in light of the tests.
Conclusions and main results
Level of compliance
This Office designed compliance criteria based on the responses of the local authorities and the Office's evaluation of the implementation of the commitments.
The various challenges of implementing the relevant commitments were also considered as part of the grading process.
For example, the workload associated with ensuring that all static material and interactive systems are made available bilingually greatly outweighs the challenge of committing to merely providing several pages in Irish.
Factors such as this impacted the final grade awarded to the local authorities.
According to the results of the audit, none of the local authorities were found to be fully compliant with the commitments made in relation to websites and interactive services in their language schemes.
The chart below indicates that only 20% of the local authorities achieved the second highest grade, that is, implementing for the most part what they had committed to.
That meant that 80% were either complying to a certain degree with the scheme's commitments or were non-compliant with the requirements for the most part.
The table below summarises the overall grade achieved by the individual local authorities.
Interactive Services
The interactive services that local authorities provide on their websites make up an important range of public services.
It is to be expected, therefore, that in the guidelines for preparing a language scheme, emphasis is placed on such services and specifically on ensuring that all new systems be available in both official languages.
Application and feedback forms are amongst the most common online services local authorities provide to the public, as well as services collecting tax payments and fines.
Apart from Limerick City and County Council, every local authority examined gave a commitment in relation to providing interactive services in Irish.
In the majority of schemes, it is stated that any new interactive services will be introduced simultaneously in Irish and in English.
Some local authorities committed also to making current systems available in Irish, when possible to do so.
Many schemes referenced the central role of the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) in the provision of systems such as these to local authorities.
It is evident that the ability of many local authorities to provide interactive services in Irish was and continues to be reliant on the systems being made available by the LGMA.
A proactive approach in requesting these systems in Irish would be beneficial to local authorities in fulfilling their statutory commitments.
Such commitments were included in some of the schemes that were examined but there was little evidence to suggest that any request was made to the LGMA.
The interactive services that the local authorities had in place were tested and the results showed a high level of noncompliance.
Even though many of the interactive systems developed by the LGMA are available in both official languages, it is evident that there are gaps in the provision of interactive services by local authorities.
Even where the Irish version of a system was available, for example www.deisighdoshráid.ie, provided by South Dublin County Council, it did not appear to be in use by the other local authorities.
Commonality of Commitments
The commonality of the commitments contained in the various schemes, in relation to the type of material and publications to be provided on the website, was also examined.
Considerable differences were observed in the commitments made in the various schemes.
In some cases, commitments are made to create an individual site dedicated to Irish material and to direct users to this site via a link on the English pages.
In contrast, one county council is operating a website in English only, apart from a small percentage of documents in Irish.
No commitment was made in relation to providing static material or certain pages bilingually in the council's language scheme.
Another local authority committed to create an Irish language page “which will identify what services are available in Irish and also what forms can be completed through the medium of Irish”, stating that “staff will be encouraged to avail of the medium of the website to develop more Irish”.
It commits to provide at least five pages in Irish on its website.
Content
Most of the language schemes examined contained a commitment to provide certain pages on the website in Irish.
Many schemes referred to a percentage of pages or various sections to be available bilingually.
Galway City Council is the only local authority that committed to providing a fully bilingual website.
Mayo County Council guaranteed that at least 95% of the static content would be available bilingually.
Although Laois County Council promised to make all the static material on the home page, along with a handful of other pages, available bilingually, the result of the audit showed that a machine translation system was being used.
Such a system is by no means an acceptable approach to providing material in Irish.
Indeed, after pursuing a formal investigation into Cork County Council in 2018, I made the following findings:
“The text in Irish which is produced by a machine translation system is not comparable with the standard of the original English text.
In fact, it could be insulting to some language communities to be expected to accept translations of poor standard, as was to be seen on the Council's website.
And it is a worse scenario still when the website is used to perform official functions of the State.”
This audit highlights the importance of having appropriate arrangements in place to ensure that any commitment given in a language scheme is implemented.
The majority of local authorities examined did not appear to have any policy or definitive protocol in place to ensure that the Irish material on its website was regularly updated and reviewed.
Publications
A greater degree of commonality was observed in the case of commitments relating to core publications such as application forms or documents that are covered by section 10 of the Act being made available in both official languages.
It was of some concern to me, however, that it was found that a considerable number of the local authorities examined by this Office had published their annual reports, along with financial statements and documents containing public policy proposals, in English only.
This was done despite the statutory requirement that they be published simultaneously in both official languages, which has been in effect since 2004.
The table below summarises the main elements of the relevant commitments provided by the local authorities.
Commitments
Recommendations
All of the local authorities were informed of the results of the audit and invited to provide any additional relevant feedback once the monitoring process was completed.
Most of the local authorities accepted the findings and stated that the relevant recommendations would be put into effect.
Among other recommendations, it was advised that:
The website is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that it is in accordance with the commitments in the language scheme;
The documents which concern statutory requirements, such as Annual Reports, Financial Statements and the Draft County Development Plan, are made available in Irish, published simultaneously with the English version and published on the website, if the English version is so published;
A system or definitive protocol is put in place in relation to keeping documents in Irish up to date on the website and that staff training is provided accordingly;
Irish language versions of any current or proposed interactive systems are requested proactively;
A system is put in place to ensure that an accurate translation of any new or updated material that is to be added to the website is promptly provided.
An Coimisinéir Teanga has the authority to initiate a formal investigation on his own initiative if he forms the opinion that provisions of the Act are being contravened.
This may be done in the case of some of the local authorities that were examined as part of this audit, in the event that the recommendations made as a result of the audits are not adequately implemented after a reasonable amount of time.
Some examples are given in Appendix D of the websites examined.
GAELTACHT COMMITMENTS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES
Summary
An audit of local authorities' scheme commitments in relation to Gaeltacht matters was carried out as part of this year's audit programme.
The importance of the provision of services by local authorities in Language Planning Areas is plain to see.
The availability of those services through Irish, as well as the authorities' ability to deal with the Irish language, affects the linguistic circumstances of the areas.
The commitments given by two local authorities with extensive Gaeltacht areas - the Galway Gaeltacht area (Galway County Council) and the Donegal Gaeltacht area (Donegal County Council) - were examined on that basis.
Galway County Council was awarded the highest grade of the compliance criteria, as it had fulfilled its commitments in full.
The results of the audit show that Donegal County Council was fulfilling only to a certain degree the commitments given in relation to the Gaeltacht.
Generally, there are extensive differences in what is promised in local authorities' language schemes, and the Gaeltacht authorities seldom get recognition for the additions to their language schemes to serve the requirements of the Gaeltacht community.
This audit mainly focused on the implementation of commitments relating specifically to the Gaeltacht.
Commitments relating to the relevant local authority's website and interactive services were also included, because these are so central in the provision of services to the Gaeltacht community.
The statutory obligation
The additional obligations on public bodies providing services in Gaeltacht areas are specified in section 13 of the Official Languages Act 2003.
When a draft language scheme is being prepared by those public bodies, they must:
13. (2) (d) ensure that the particular Irish language requirements associated with the provision of services in Gaeltacht areas are met,
(e) ensure that the Irish language becomes the working language in its offices in the Gaeltacht not later than such date as may be determined by it with the consent of the Minister.
Clarification is given in relation to the “particular Irish language requirements” in the guidelines published under section 12 of the Act.
The guidelines advise that the scheme must set out the steps to be taken to ensure that -over time, where this is not already the case - Irish becomes the default language of service delivery in the Gaeltacht.
Brochures and leaflets, application forms, press releases, websites, public meetings and the use of official Irish language placenames are included within those services.
Where the Irish language is not already the internal working language of such offices, it will be necessary to plan for it over a period of time and to include the various stages of the process in the language scheme.
In accordance with the guidelines, the public body will need to consider the following:
Opportunities for existing staff to train/upskill language competence.
Ability to work through Irish as an essential requirement in any recruitment or promotion competition to a Gaeltacht office after the commencement date of the scheme.
Need to ensure that instructions, manuals and other resource material are issued to offices in the Gaeltacht in the Irish language at the same time as they are issued in the English language to other offices.
The audit work
In August 2019 a questionnaire was issued to the relevant local authorities requesting information in relation to the implementation of the various sections of their language schemes, respectively.
We received comprehensive answers in relation to those questionnaires and we were also provided with samples in relation to the implementation of the various commitments.
Having examined all the material, along with undertaking some testing of our own, we requested more information from the Councils in respect of the audit.
As a first step, the local authorities' answers were examined.
As a second step, the Office's assessment on the implementation of the commitments was included.
As a third step, a rating was given to every relevant commitment examined in relation to its compliance level.
Main outcomes
A full grade was awarded to the local authorities based on the level of compliance they achieved in relation to each commitment.
A similar criterion to that used in the audit on local authorities' websites was utilised for the purpose of this audit.
It was decided that a local authority could achieve one of five grades in relation to their Gaeltacht commitments.
Galway County Council achieved the highest grade after it demonstrated to this Office that there was significant progress and an ongoing effort to fully comply with its Gaeltacht commitments.
Donegal County Council had also made progress in relation to the implementation of its commitments.
It was also clear, however, that important aspects of the provision of services in Irish in the Gaeltacht were not being adhered to.
The third highest grade - compliance to a certain degree -was therefore awarded to the Council.
* Galway County Council confirmed its third language scheme during this investigation, with effect from 9 September 2019; therefore, this investigation focussed on the second scheme.
A brief account is given below on the main commitments examined during the investigation, the manner in which they were complied with and of some of the recommendations given in each case.
Donegal County Council
The commitments given in the fourth language scheme agreed to by Donegal County Council relate mainly to:
service centres operating through Irish,
guiding principles in relation to Gaeltacht services,
Gaeltacht placenames, and
the County Development Plan
The commitments in relation to the website were also examined.
Working Language in Gaeltacht Offices
In the case of Donegal County Council, the most significant non-compliance related to Irish being a working language in certain offices in the Gaeltacht.
An account is given in Donegal County Council's language scheme in relation to the offices, the departments and the various Gaeltacht centres that function on a bilingual basis or through Irish for the most part.
Libraries, a community services centre and a fire station are included.
The status of the use of Irish in those centres was examined.
The Council stated that the constraints placed on recruitment during the economic recession had a detrimental effect on compliance with commitments in relation to this area.
In the case of the Public Library in An Clochán Liath, for example, it was stated that the library could function through Irish, primarily, up until an Irish speaker retired, at a time when there was a national embargo on recruitment.
It was recommended in this case that the appropriate steps would be taken to ensure that the offices based in Gaeltacht areas are functioning fully through Irish as soon as possible, and in the meantime that it is ensured that services through Irish are available to the public on request.
County Development Plan
Elements of the County Development Plan are entwined with language scheme commitments. During the investigation it emerged that no language condition had been put in place regarding the development of some housing units, as is required by the County Development Plan.
It was claimed that this occurred due to an error, but it was admitted that there were weaknesses in the system that was in place.
Information was provided to this Office in relation to the approach being taken to tackle these weaknesses.
Gaeltacht Placenames
There is a commitment given that the use of official Gaeltacht placenames will be “promoted”.
Although the Council recommends the use of the official placenames to all departments, it was noted that the use of the nonofficial versions was prevalent, especially in press releases.
Gortahork, Burtonport and Malinbeg were mentioned, for example, in at least four press releases on the site.
It was advised that official Gaeltacht placenames should be used in the Council's press releases.
Website & Interactive Services
Even though commitments given in relation to the website and online systems are not exclusive to the Gaeltacht, they are facilities available to the Irish speaking community.
The lack of progress on the website and on the interactive systems was of particular concern to the investigation, especially in light of the audit which took place on the matter last year.
This investigation showed that gaps were still noticeable in the Irish version of the site.
This meant that the English version had to be availed of to access necessary information.
When this was advised to the Council in a draft monitoring report, the Council undertook amendments immediately.
It was recommended that a full audit of the site should take place and that the appropriate amendments would be implemented within six months.
The Council was also asked to provide a report to this Office in relation to the progress on the website.
Galway County Council
Provision for a range of important services to be made available through Irish in the Gaeltacht is a central part of the second scheme agreed to by Galway County Council.
The commitments that were subject to this investigation relate primarily to:
correspondence and meetings with the Gaeltacht community, and
the use of Irish on signage and in Gaeltacht offices
Commitments in relation to the website and interactive services were also examined.
It should be mentioned that the Council confirmed its third scheme during the investigation.
The only amendment made to the Gaeltacht commitments was that it was promised that tweets would be issued in relation to Gaeltacht areas in Irish only, except when the message is urgent and a translation cannot be provided in time.
Working Language in Gaeltacht Offices
Irish was confirmed as the working language of the Council's offices in An Cheathrú Rua.
It was noted that three officers work in the office and they all have fluent Irish.
Telephone calls are answered with Irish language greetings and the phone call may be continued in the customer's choice of language after that.
Correspondence
Any general correspondence generated by the Council in a Gaeltacht area is in Irish only, or bilingual.
A sample of a bilingual letter in relation to the electoral register was provided.
In addition, the Council has committed that other organisations working in conjunction with it are informed of relevant sections of the language scheme.
Proof was provided in this case of a notice in Irish, distributed by WEEE Ireland, in relation to dangerous goods collections in a Gaeltacht area.
Meetings
It was stated that any public meetings convened by the Council or on its behalf in the Gaeltacht would continue to be held in Irish.
It is the same case for any meeting dealing with specific Gaeltacht issues.
It was stated that simultaneous translation could be provided if necessary.
There is also a commitment that the officials who attend meetings with a person of whom it is known that Irish is their chosen language, will be Irish speakers, factoring in that the Council automatically accepts that Irish is the language of choice in the Gaeltacht.
Signage
The Council has given four commitments in relation to signage in the Gaeltacht.
A commitment was given to use internationally recognised symbols on signs in the Gaeltacht instead of English text.
An example was given of a sign which is erected at An Trá Mhór in Indreabhán in relation to a wheelchair for the beach.
It was also confirmed that a language condition pertains to any planning permission granted by the Council in a Gaeltacht area, that all permanent signage would be in Irish only and that the accuracy of the text must be confirmed by the Council or by an appropriate language expert.
Evidence was provided to this Office that the commitments in relation to Gaeltacht signage were being complied with, and samples of planning conditions in respect of signage attached to planning permissions were provided.
Website and Interactive Services
An undertaking was given that the Irish used in the Council's publications would be easy to understand, with attention to accuracy in relation to standard spelling and grammar.
The website was in line with what was promised.
Conclusion
A draft of the monitoring report which had been prepared, including the results of the audit, was forwarded to the Councils, and they were given the opportunity to provide us with any additional feedback they thought relevant.
Galway County Council advised that a note would be made of the results and recommendations of the audit.
Donegal County Council accepted the assessment of the Office.
The audit was informed that some of the amendments had already been made to the website and extra information was made available in relation to the approach being taken to implement all the recommendations of the audit.
It was advised by Donegal County Council that the Council would focus primarily on the implementation of the recommendations that related to the website and to Irish as a working language in the office in An Clochán Liath.
In relation to the website, the Council stated that a review and amendments will take place over a six month period and that a report on that work will be sent to me before the end of September.
A commitment was also given that an Irish language service would be made available to the public on request in the Council's Gaeltacht offices.
It was stated that it is not possible in the short-term to have Irish as the working language in the office in An Clochán Liath, despite the statutory requirements.
The reason given for this is that not all of the staff are competent in Irish, due to the fact that a number of staff who were fluent in Irish retired between 2009 and early 2017, during the economic recession.
The Council was obliged to appoint people in their place from its current complement, some of whom were not fluent in Irish, due to the restrictions which were in place in respect of recruitment at the time.
COMPUTER SYSTEMS OF THE OFFICE OF THE REVENUE COMMISSIONERS
Summary
The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is recognised as one of the public bodies that provided a wide range of services through the Irish language.
This audit focused mainly on commitments concerning the ability of the computer systems and the interactive systems of the Revenue Commissioners to accept the acute accent or síneadh fada.
For some time, my Office has been in receipt of complaints regarding the ongoing difficulties customers had in using text with síntí fada on various systems of the Revenue Commissioners.
The complainants accepted that the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is providing a comprehensive service in Irish, but it was a matter of frustration to them that the system was crashing after updating, as it could not deal with the síneadh fada.
It was accepted that the fault was corrected each time, once pointed out to the Revenue Commissioners, but it appeared that there may have been a systemic error in the process, as this problem came to the fore regularly.
The use of computer systems to access services is increasing daily.
That is clearly the case with the Revenue Commissioners, where there are more electronic services made available in line with the Government's electronic services strategy.
The availability of services through Irish and the ability of the system to deal with the Irish language is clearly of utmost importance, and that is recognised by the Revenue Commissioners in their language scheme.
The Minister approved the Revenue Commissioners' first language scheme in 2005 and the second scheme in 2013.
I needed to ascertain if all the computer systems were able to deal with the síneadh fada, and to gather information regarding the testing method in use to ensure the síneadh fada functions following every update.
I decided to undertake the audit in three different stages:
An audit into the complaints on the subject received by the Office to date,
Seek a written answer to specific questions, and
Undertake a physical testing of the system on receipt of that answer, including a meeting and discussion with the testing group.
Part 1 of the Audit: Examine the complaints on the matter received by the Office
A number of complaints were received over the past couple of years regarding the difficulties the system had in dealing with the síneadh fada.
One complainant stated that it was a regular occurrence, when the system was upgraded, that he was not able to enter any name with a síneadh fada.
The examples given over the years included (1) a difficulty using the síneadh fada in employment identity, and (2) a síneadh fada in a name on a bank account.
Part 2 of the Audit: Written answer requested for specific questions
In the answer provided to the questionnaire sent to the Revenue Commissioners, it was advised that there are 3 main applications/systems operated by that office (ROS, myAccount and LPT).
A breakdown on all the various services available through ROS was given - 106 services in total.
Of those, it was advised that 6 were not available in Irish - 2 relating to claiming tax relief on a mortgage at source, and 4 relating to customs and excise.
It was maintained that the process to regularly update the services gives an opportunity to resolve such issues as they arise, and it was stated that a staff member was specifically working to locate the gaps in the Irish versions of ROS and to update the services.
Part 3 of the Audit: Physical testing of the system on receipt of that answer, including a meeting and discussion with the testing group
An official from my Office visited the Central Technical Testing division of the Revenue Commissioners in August 2019.
Discussions were held with the Maintenance and Enhancement section, with 12 members of staff - two controllers and ten staff.
This is the section responsible for the upgrading work on the various computer systems.
During the audit, it was decided to examine the following systems, which included different aspects of three main online systems of the Revenue Commissioners:
It was advised that the Central Technical Testing Centre was the Revenue Commissioner's testing centre of excellence and that it has achieved the ISO 29119 certification.
It provides expertise and governance for every aspect of the Revenue Commissioners functional and nonfunctional testing of software systems developed internally and by third parties.
It was confirmed during the visit that the requirement for the síneadh fada is included in the acceptability criterion for the testing.
Clarification was requested regarding the person who was working to fill the gaps in the Irish version of ROS, so that this matter could be discussed with them.
Revenue advised that a person had been working on that project on a 6-month contract, but that contract had ended during the summer.
Furthermore, Revenue advised that the work involved was not focused on the on-screen gaps or on inaccurate Irish, but solely on the computer code.
Revenue stated that there are thousands of lines of code as a background to the ROS system, and as it was developed before the statutory obligation to provide it simultaneously in Irish, there are large gaps in the Irish version.
It is necessary to go through each single line of code, one by one, to identify these gaps.
Aside from that, the gaps cannot be identified until someone attempts to use the system and does not achieve the required result.
It was confirmed that nobody is working on this project at present and that it is not known when there will be.
It was stated that any information will be welcomed regarding omissions or inaccuracies on the Irish screens, and that Revenue will amend on receipt of this information.
Draft report
A draft monitoring report was issued to the Revenue Commissioners, to advise the audit of any error or inaccuracy.
In their answer to that draft-report, the Revenue Commissioners said they noted that two problems had been identified in relation to síntí fada in 5 of the 130 services examined, and they said the following:
“1.
Bank Accounts: EU SEPA Protocol states it does not accept síntí fada in its specifications.
Some bank systems are unable to accept síntí fada either.
As part of the older systems of the Revenue Commissioners, there is validation on the screen, which restricts the acceptance of síntí fada.
In other cases, síntí fada are permitted and these are removed in the background to adhere to SEPA protocols.
This is our standard approach for our new developments and they will be retrofitted, as part of the maintenance cycle.
This is a multi-purpose approach in relation to languages, and it shows the continued progression of the Revenue Commissioner's computer ecosystem, which in part contains legacy services, and was developed with validation built-in which restricts the input of síntí fada.
2.
Email addresses: In one case, our system did not accept the síneadh fada in an email address.
This service was developed a number of years ago and at that time, there was a general coding restriction in place on the inclusion of síntí fada in email addresses, because of email protocols at the time.
The Revenue Commissioners accept the proposal being made and an amendment will be made to the FDS to include this necessity.”
The Revenue Commissioners said that they are satisfied, overall, that strong processes are in place to ensure their systems accept síntí fada a nd that a comprehensive test on the systems is done in relation to this obligation when software changes are being made.
I welcome the actions being taken by the Revenue Commissioners in resolving these areas.
It should also be clarified, of course, that a limited number of systems were examined, on a sample basis, as part of the audit.
The Revenue Commissioners gave some clarification also in relation to some problems with inaccurate translations that were identified during the audit process, and had the following to say on the matter:
“Four samples of inaccurate translations were identified.
The Revenue Commissioners have a best practice approach in place to translate text to Irish for their online services.
The Revenue Commissioners have a translation centre of excellence in Galway, and we also have the option of outsourcing translations to translation service providers, if required.
The Revenue Commissioners will continue to amend any translation errors identified, and they are of the opinion that it is evident that the approach in place at the moment in respect of providing satisfactory translations is practical and successful in the majority of cases”.
This Office recognises the importance of the translation centre of excellence, based in Galway.
It would be beneficial for a planned programme to be in place to review the Irish language text in the computer systems.
The Revenue Commissioners advised my Office that they ensure that the Irish translations specified in the design documents are in accordance with the final product, on the screen and also in the physical output.
They also advised that there is no member of staff in Revenue's Central Technical Testing division with the expertise to assess Irish translations.
It is our understanding that arrangements are in place to ensure that any new developments are accurate in relation to the Irish language.
It was confirmed that the Revenue Commissioners provide more than 130 services online, and that in excess of €70 billion was collected by means of these services in 2019.
The Revenue Commissioners stated they are fully committed to providing a service to those who wish to conduct their business through Irish.
The Revenue Commissioners stated that they provide these services to approximately 3,800 customers who choose to conduct their business through Irish.
It was also confirmed that every new service is developed to provide the required functionality so business may be conducted through Irish, that the Revenue Commissioner's testing processes are validated to ISO29119 standard and that some specific checks are factored into these processes ensuring the Irish language and síntí fada are accepted.
It was clear from the audit that improvements were implemented as a result of the complaints made to date and I welcome that approach.
Main outcomes / Findings
The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has provided a wide range of online services in Irish, and there is access now to an Irish version of the majority of services provided for individuals.
Some improvements have also been put in place in the testing system, in an effort to pre-empt any difficulties that could arise, especially in testing for the síneadh fada and the impact of updating on the use of the síneadh fada.
An extra step is required in the testing system to ensure the síneadh fada is included, as appropriate, at the testing stage.
Overall, it was clear that there is access to a wide range of services in Irish and that those services are operating as they should, and capable of dealing with the síneadh fada, for the most part.
Nevertheless, there were some gaps in the systems.
These related to difficulties in using the síneadh fada in a name on a bank account and in an email address, inaccurate translations, the number of characters permitted in a name, and output in English as a result of input in Irish.
Attention should be concentrated on the work required to fix the inaccuracies and fill the gaps on the Irish-language screens.
Some minor amendments were discussed during the audit which could be added to the testing, and these were included in the recommendations made.
Main recommendations
The main recommendations of the audit included:
that an extra step be put in place for the Functional Design Specification (FDS), which is the cornerstone of the updating process, to ensure that testing the síneadh fada is included as part of the primary design from the outset,
that the amount of characters permitted for names in the system is increased and that the errors that were identified during the audit are amended,
that the gaps still in the Irish version in the computing code in use by ‘ROS' are appropriately addressed.
