Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Courts of Auditors have the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the courts of auditors should have the power to audit tax collection as widely as possible.
The Organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the Courts of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As the national economies are increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which the national audit bodies can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit bodies of other states.
An example could be the examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many states.
Cooperation between authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Courts of Auditors that audit in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the value added tax and the MIAS system was born at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating courts of auditors first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the analysis of the available information, we made the selection of the subject matter for the examination planning.
Achieving efficient and effective management of turnover tax is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of turnover tax and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Case number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Administration of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
the Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of value added tax in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to address them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany under an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between tax administrations, and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the focus on the exchange of information provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of tax payers, tax returns and summary reports.
The audit also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold laid down in the Value Added Tax Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax payer receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purposes of value added tax.
If the German taxpayer wishes to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the issuance of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) International passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, international passenger transport by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic tax payers have to file VAT returns only for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), in Germany tax payers have to file VAT returns (monthly or quarterly)
pre-registration of sales tax and after the end of the calendar year to file a sales tax annual return.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany have to file their VAT pre-declarations electronically.
The introduction of the electronic filing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While tax payers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary declarations to the tax authorities (FÄ), German tax payers have to submit the summary declarations to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the data from the Summary Notifications will be available to FÄ in the Czech Republic as soon as they are submitted.
The data from the Summary Reports will not be available to German FÄ until they have been processed by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of the turnover and the update of the MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely assessment of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In the case of requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German tax administration has dealt with a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the prescribed period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a continuous monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two courts examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were reviewed jointly through the use of the legal possibilities of the CLO where there were doubts as to the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the tax payers concerned.
In these cases, the tax payers had either made unlawful use of the VAT exemption or had not stated the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ were unable to use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to differences in legislation in the two Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax payers incorrectly reported turnover in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were accordingly incorrect, so that the case officers (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedures in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the territorial audit departments of Central Bohemia, North-West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited bodies were: the Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of NKÚ approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the audit area traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual testing began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination to several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following FÄ were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, discussions were held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the examination were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held between representatives of both courts.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the legislation on value added tax and the system of value added tax administration in each country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel tests: 1.
Registration of tax payers.
2.
International passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the handling by tax officials of requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the value added tax area.
At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarised themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the already achieved results of the parallel tests.

An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover for the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 becomes liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll., on VAT; hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he or she has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a tax payer if he has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other requirements set out in Act No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
Upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer, the registration procedure pursuant to Law no. 337 / 1992 begins.
If you want to register voluntarily for value added tax, you must indicate in your application the cut-off date from which you apply for registration as a VAT payer.
The tax officer has to check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all the installations.
If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he shall invite the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the tax officer has verified that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he shall issue a written opinion on the registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the decision, the tax officer shall indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the assessment period for the VAT.
The taxation period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the taxation period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the preceding calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 is entitled to choose the calendar month as the taxation period and has to inform the tax officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration notice always has a constitutive character.
The tax payer shall provide the tax identification number in all communications (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where this is required by a special law (e.g. Law No. 235 / 2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification symbol.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or other general identification mark, as determined by a special law. In the case of legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law no. 337 / 1992).
If, despite being requested to do so by the tax officer, the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation, the local tax officer shall register him ex officio.
A notice of this will also be sent to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur licensed to do business receives a tax number for any type of tax when he registers for the first time.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
Pursuant to Law no. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-fulfilment of the VAT registration obligation, the tax officer may require the tax payer to pay up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a tax payer until the date on which the registration as a tax payer was made by order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of Law no. 235 / 2004).
Payment of the amount thus determined shall be deemed to be a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law no. 235 / 2004, i.e. it shall not constitute a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a person liable for VAT can be deleted for two reasons:
1) Donald Trump
Cancellation of the registration at the request of the tax payer, i.e. mainly because the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Act no. 235 / 2004).
A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force stated in the registration notice.
2) Cancellation of the registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004) if: a) the tax payer has not provided a service for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officer of the reasons for this, b) the tax payer has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax payer no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax payer.
B) Tax payer without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have his legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, or a tax payer foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and is required to file a tax return and pay taxes for such services or supplies pursuant to section 108 of Act No. 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes tax payer with the provision of the service in question.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT identification numbers allocated to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the date of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic, FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became subject to VAT on the date of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004.
In the case of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 must request from the entrepreneurs concerned a receipt (invoices or written explanations) for proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic prior to the first performance of a service, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the performance-justifying contract documents.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is authorised to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or returns and to pay tax.
An audit of the NKÚ revealed that in the case of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, cancellation of the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question is no longer possible.
Registration of tax payers in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax code (§ § 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business activities.
The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been started but has not been declared, it may also register the tax payer ex officio retroactively.
In Germany, tax payers are obliged to register for VAT purposes, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, if they fulfil the requirements of § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the level of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special FÄ are responsible for foreign-based entrepreneurs.
For example, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who have their registered office in the Czech Republic.
As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with it; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the findings of the BRH, these FÄ with special competences frequently refused to register so-called false self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted following the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (certificate) self-employed persons do not fulfil the conditions specified in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they are usually dependent on a single client, who determines their working time and the type of work to be carried out.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide details of the company and the business activity carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the FÄ or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
This form is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual tax payer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identifier for the tax payer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the tax payer declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-declarations or in his annual VAT return.
The VAT ID number consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be cancelled: 1. On request (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after completion of all taxation transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the tax administration determines that he is no longer doing business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the cancellation of the VAT number, so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at that time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax payers do not have to pay value added tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 €and 2. is unlikely to exceed the amount of 50,000 €in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and file an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner may declare the non-application of Section 19 (1) of the VAT Act.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the value added tax and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident tax payers may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only carry out tax-free transactions and do not deduct VAT.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices must state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold set out in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences may occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax payer receives a tax number at the time of his or her first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both NKÚ and BRH found that the German two-tier registration system can lead to significant misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which issue a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows for retrospective (national registration) in cases where the tax payer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows an accurate assessment of the value added tax for previous tax periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures give rise to problems, the rules should be harmonised across the EC.
The German Parliament has recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.
This number is valid for natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person starts a business activity, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of the VAT number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers is ongoing.
International passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of § 70 of Law No. 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons registered as tax payers in other Member States or by foreigners subject to tax in their own country.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport procedure.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the international transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
International passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act on Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b), which states in the text:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for international passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person transports persons through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany shall be deemed to be taxable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus and coach named in the tax payer's registration.
The entrepreneur must state his tax-liable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA.
If the transport service is provided for an entrepreneur resident in the country, the non-resident tax payer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident tax payer, which is referred to as "transfer of liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax payer and his / her income tax return, the German tax administration has several means at its disposal to verify the accuracy of the tax return with regard to tax-liable passenger transport:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad, which are used for the transport of passengers through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax payer may deduct the value added tax paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the IO has doubts as to the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the IO, or it may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established value-added tax, the IFA may request mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters for checking the value added tax return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the low income from value added tax on passenger transport subject to tax.
In particular, auditing the books of a non-resident tax payer incurs disproportionate costs for the tax payer himself and for the tax administration.
The latter must check the foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit is likely to require more time than that of a resident tax payer, although the audit is limited to passenger transport taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national tax administration, but also those of the other Member States in so far as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the tax payer must comply with all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT by virtue of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the route allocated to German territory.
If a non-resident tax payer provides such a transport service for the first time, he or she must notify the competent FA in advance.
This registers the taxable person, who has to declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which levy turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of the VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the State in which the transport begins or in which the service provider is established.
This type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise provided by law, even if no tax liability has arisen, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.
The tax liability arises upon expiry of the deadline for filing the VAT return. According to Act no. 235 / 2004, VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here, the due date of the tax is determined in accordance with customs regulations.
If a claim for a refund arises as a result of higher-than-average deductible input taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the date on which this deduction was established, without the need to file an application.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the tax payer.
Pursuant to § 73 (11) of Act No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduct input tax may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax was established.
After expiry of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
This requires, however, the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been claimed for the first time.
A tax payer must file a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections that do not change the last known tax liability, but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of Act no. 235 / 2004.
A tax payer may file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question have been established.
The VAT declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data media.
The delivery via Internet can be carried out with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings will be used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as subject to tax will be compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary declarations.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered there as subject to tax is compared with the information in the summary declarations of tax payers from other EC Member States with the help of MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, a credibility check of VAT returns is carried out by the FA.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior check.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 37 (1) of Law No. 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.
During its audit, the NKÚ found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the tax payer in the event of failure to file a VAT return.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-declarations and the annual VAT return.
Those tax payers, who are obliged to file advance VAT declarations, must still file an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners, who are not obliged to pay VAT, have to file an annual VAT return.
Tax payers are generally obliged to file a VAT pre-declaration by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the value added tax is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the value added tax liability amounted to more than €6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to file monthly advance VAT declarations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The tax payer may also decide to file monthly VAT pre-declarations if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual value added tax does not amount to more than 512 €, neither VAT declarations nor VAT returns are to be submitted.
A resulting VAT liability has to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the tax administration.
(Statutory) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a prompt refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
As a matter of principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.
The German Value Added Tax Act allows for an extension of these (surrender or payment) periods (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the time limit must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the submission of the VAT advance declarations and the corresponding payments may take place one month later. However, in the case of monthly declarations, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must file a corrected VAT pre-declaration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the tax payer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can normally only be corrected in cases of frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.
Tax payers must submit their VAT pre-declarations electronically.
FÄ may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the declaration is made without certification, the tax payer must also submit the declaration on paper and with his or her personal signature.
If no advance VAT declarations or returns are submitted, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax payer 6.
In the event of late filing, the taxpayer may be subject to a late payment surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier audit, the BRH found that FÄ often do not levy this late payment surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ levied the late payment surcharges, the amount was fixed in a non-uniform and arbitrary manner.
The late payment surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular with regard to the filing of the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community supplies or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the tax administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
After all data is collected electronically, it is subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain criteria.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically generated audit notes (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the value added tax liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers are required to file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the taxable period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, tax payers have to file their pre-declarations no later than 10 days after the end of either the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability for the previous year.
The annual VAT return must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to file an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax payer can correct the errors in the monthly advance declarations by filing a single VAT return;
- If the taxable person corrects his / her information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax payers until the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This duty will enable the German tax administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual VAT return with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can check the amount of the turnover only on the basis of the submitted income tax return.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax payers are obliged to submit their advance VAT declaration electronically.
The introduction of the requirement for electronic filing of tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary messages
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur supplying goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes is required to submit such summary declarations (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to VAT number 7, the individual tax payers under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
Tax payers with a calendar monthly or quarterly taxation period must submit the ZM to the local tax authority no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the discovery of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM will always be replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, tax payers can also file the ZM electronically.
If a tax payer does not submit a ZM or amending ZM, even though he is obliged to do so in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer shall invite him to submit the relevant ZM, pointing out the consequences of non-submission. If non-monetary obligations are not fulfilled, the tax officer shall have the power to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Act No. 337 / 1992.
The NKÚ's audit found that, in most cases, the FÄ did not use its power to impose fines on its defaulting taxpayers.
Particularly when handing over the ZM, the tax payers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to hand over a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Correction ZM, to remove any ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the tax payer corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a corrective ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The tax officer shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the taxable person does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- the tax official has proved the incorrectness of the information reported by the tax payer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax officer without a correction ZM being submitted by the tax payer do not replace the duty of the tax payer to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department for International Mutual Assistance in the Field of Value Added Tax in the Ministry of Finance) and the "O _ MCTL" notification is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect VAT ID numbers, which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the incorrect VAT ID number.
The list includes a "Notice of Doubts Concerning VAT No."
The tax officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the dedicated lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made indicated by the Czech tax payer in his VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods indicated by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The officials there will have to investigate the discrepancies.
Three different situations can then occur:
a) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the tax officer checks the accuracy of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation may arise either through a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or through a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative in the meantime).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
c) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, as stated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return, is higher than the value of their deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Again, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax official enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be sent to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent for audit by the CLO for the individual quarters of 2005 can be seen in Graph 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is partly due to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in VAT returns and EC data do not always have to be due to an error on the part of the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error on the part of the taxable person in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the ZM are indicated differently in different EC Member States.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FÄ can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of the summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZM in which the intra-Community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be handed in no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of the VAT pre-declarations, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed in to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.
The relevant FA may allow exemptions for individual tax payers in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the tax payer determines that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a corrective ZM within one month.
In the event of non-surrender of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, accompanied by the threat of a penalty payment and - setting of the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows penalty payments of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of €125, €250 and €500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) no. 5 UStG stipulates that the tax payer acts irregularly if he intentionally or recklessly does not submit a ZM correctly, completely or not in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or not in time.
This infringement can be punished by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the FÄ, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for the processing of the ZM.
The data of the ZM are only saved at the CLO.
The data from the Summary Notifications will not be available to FÄ until they have been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID number in the ZM of German tax payers, the German CLO will receive a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the contractor and asks for the correct data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT number at the request of the CLO.
However, reminding, threatening and fixing up to three consecutive penalty payments takes too much time when a tax payer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant FÄ, were usually closed within one to two months.
The respective IAs refused to grant exemption for the notified intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases 9.
If the taxman provided the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data itself.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the tax payers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the data on goods deliveries made in the VAT pre-declarations or the VAT return with the corresponding data in the ZM before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT identification numbers will be identified and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of income tax in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO matches them with data from previous calendar quarters.
If they fulfil certain criteria (see 5.2), control notices will be issued and sent to the relevant FÄ.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a listing of the acquisition data of all persons subject to VAT is later prepared and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully checks (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must hand over a ZM to the local competent authority within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of the intra-Community deliveries declared by the tax payers in the ZM are compared with the values of the intra-Community deliveries stated by the same tax payers in their VAT returns.
The results of the comparison will be taken into account when setting the tax.
In Germany, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since January 1, 2007, taxpayers have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, tax payers in the ZM state only the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not indicated in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the tax payer reported the correct VAT ID number to the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German tax payers in their VAT pre-declarations with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-notification and the ZM are regularly not detected before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.
On the basis of these findings by the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
Data provided by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech tax payers will be compared in the Czech Republic with data on purchases of goods indicated by Czech tax payers in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the adjustment for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations will be referred to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general check will only be carried out on taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax payers only if the RMS draws up an audit report or the tax payer has been selected for an audit in any case.
This procedure relieves the FÄ of the need to clarify the reasons for differences that occur.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, up-to-date information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.
The current system of ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to hand in monthly payments.
The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, since most tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to file monthly VAT returns or pre-declarations anyway, and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or pre-declarations.
In order to avoid red tape, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of the VAT returns or advance declarations.
However, a requirement to submit ZM on a monthly basis would cause more periodic discrepancies between information on intra-Community supplies and information on intra-Community purchases and would increase data flows between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the commitment to the monthly delivery of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly delivery at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on deliveries of goods and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL reports exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
These data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL notification was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Execution of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions as well as on the tax payers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of value added tax, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standard SCAC form.
Tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or responses to a received RFI through the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which will translate the information provided in the standard SCAC form into the foreign language and forward it to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to sent requests. It arranges their translation into Czech and their distribution to the relevant FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a time limit of no more than three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by NKÚ.
Out of a total of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in graph 2.
Out of a total of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) a reply was received within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases no reply had been received from Germany at the time of examination by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine, based on the information provided, when Germany replied to the request for information).
More detailed information on the time limits within which requests for information from the Czech Republic were answered from Germany can be found in Graph 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover values indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graph 4.
The graph above shows that the turnover audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values in excess of €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Tax officials in other Member States are often provided with information, without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between Member States is carried out electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-determined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to another Member State without its prior request, as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The tax officer obtains this information from the form notification of delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235 / 2004 as well as from a copy of the issued invoice.
When processing this form, the tax officer enters the required data in the relevant document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Afterwards, this data is transmitted to the other Member States within the prescribed period, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be illegal and on potential "missing traders."
This information will be sent to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Execution of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local competent FA.
FÄ will send the completed SCAC 2004 form by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which will forward the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is single-language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure income taxation in the other Member State or to prove that intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State are exempt from tax.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will examine whether the value of the deliveries referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are neither written in German nor in English.
In order to reply to the request for information, the CLO will forward it to the competent FA, referring to the three-month deadline.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary human resources to remind the FÄ to respond to the unresolved requests for information.
The FÄ receive the required information by writing to the tax payer or carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special value added tax audit, which covers all transactions subject to tax within a period of several months, or the so-called value added tax audit, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
With this short and ﬂexible form of audit, an announcement to the tax payer is not necessary and has proven its worth in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany provides the other Member State with the following information: - on VAT identification numbers allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of VAT to traders established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information in the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. The supply of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT number, b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a tax payer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods which have been inappropriately taxed in Germany by the tax payer, e. Potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, and f. Tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have misused a VAT number.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent authorities, who send the relevant SCAC forms to the CLO.
Whereas the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates provided information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to draw up requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, whereas the requests for information addressed to Germany were completed by the German tax administration only in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO notifies the FÄ of the three-month deadline, it does not monitor compliance with it.
As a result of the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of time-limited requests for information.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities to reply to the outstanding requests for information.
Value added tax risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at various levels of financial administration are involved in risk management in the area of value added tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of Value Added Tax or its Risk Management Unit deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this unit coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
On the basis of data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares conceptual risk management in the area of turnover tax and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental mutual assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Tax Audit and Investigation Methodology Unit carries out, among other things, risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, establishes priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be audited, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the tax administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation units exist at the tax directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax payers and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax payers (e.g. in the sectors of Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in cases of chain fraud and the informing of local tax authorities.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected FÄ.
These have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, also carry out tax audits outside the local competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in detected new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units audit according to the needs of the tax investigation services or focus on tax payers with specific activities, multinational companies and tax payers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing risks in the field of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "Credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk of tax returns filed; - the task of "Selection of tax payers to be audited," selecting the tax payers to be audited on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAS," which allows tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task enables, inter alia, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of tax payers from other Member States; - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax payer as stated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax payer in question from other Member States; - establishment of a list of tax payers who have not submitted a ZM; - formal control of the information provided by tax payers in the Czech Republic in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States; - establishment of a list of tax payers whose VAT returns do not match the information on deliveries of goods to other Member States; - establishment of a list of tax payers whose VAT returns do not match the information on the value of goods purchased from other Member States in the ZM of all their suppliers from other Member States 13.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data held by public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.
More detailed information on this can be found in section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the Summary Reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a fully uniform database.
At CLO level, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Unit for Special Value Added Tax Audit and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on cases of fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, a further database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter and also query the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KUSS will be brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT No. of other Member States appearing in the ZM of German tax payers will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT ID numbers mentioned in the ZM shall be checked on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID numbers, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on the MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications to detect suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics are used as clues, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The Federal States are required to process these notifications and, in certain cases, to forward the outcome of their investigations to the CLO.
The audit by the BRH has confirmed that all available features must be taken into account in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of various indications in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the sector of activity or the shareholding of the company.
A second level of risk management exists at the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-declarations and annual returns.
For example, the system draws up a list of those tax payers who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT declaration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete surrender of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the tax payer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The tax administrations of the Länder avoid comparing the quarterly data, as this would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
- the supplier and the acquirer assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community transactions;
- different accounting recording and tax declaration of discounts and rebates.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many Länder have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. the wording of the company, the age of the owners / partners, the number of employees and the method of payment of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax cheats are identified.
This system is used in the processing of VAT advance declarations by the FÄ.
Thus the competent FA receives the instructions of the RMS before the value added tax is determined.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the tax payers concerned.
After the audit, tax auditors will have to report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and a few other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called data mining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax payer is involved in tax fraud.
It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax cheats.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the tax payers concerned for audit and report the audit results to the data centre concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems appropriate.
Whether the hoped-for effects will materialize during actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Just like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has not proved to be a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
Tax losses caused by pan-European VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel audits, NKÚ and BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or
acquisitions that were the subject of international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two audit courts jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, the execution of which was in doubt, or which the tax payers of both states declared differently in their tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax payers.
In addition, in 43 cases, NKÚ audited the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax payers had stated in their tax returns and ZM, on the basis of communications from BRH.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged solely on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax payer purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech tax payer declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to check the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
It also emerged from the reply that the VAT ID number of the German tax payer was only valid as of 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German tax payer and brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax payer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax payer.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech tax payer had filed supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible clerk of the Czech Tax Office was not able to establish unambiguously whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries from the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only of a tax number valid exclusively for Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively allocate a VAT ID number to a tax payer, this was done in 2006 by the responsible officer of the German tax administration with retroactive effect from 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the tax payer applied for a VAT ID number.
In this case, the CLO grants the VAT ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not require a valid VAT ID number for an intra-Community delivery in accordance with § 6 of the VAT Act.
Conversely, a German buyer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of his supplier in order to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted the VAT ID number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
Within the framework of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested the verification of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is March 5, 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates October 1, 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities stated that the German tax payer had been registered on 1 October 2004 but, for organisational reasons, had only been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany on 16 February 2005.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, NKÚ learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit of the Czech tax payer for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech tax payer had declared in his VAT return services to the value of CZK 9,897 which he had provided to the German tax payer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) Tax Office established a tax liability of CZK 1,880 to the Czech tax payer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the NKÚ request, the BRH found out that the German tax payer had only been allocated the VAT ID number when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the filing of the 2004 VAT return.
In this VAT return, the tax payer stated intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic to the value of €160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In his VAT return for September 2004, as well as in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer stated deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax payer.
When checking the registration of the German tax payer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid as of 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods had been delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax payer filed a supplementary VAT return in which he declared turnover from domestic deliveries in the amount of CZK 114,615 and VAT in the amount of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Following a request to the local tax authority in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer subsequently submitted an application for the resumption of the taxation procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax payer had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax payer within the framework of the international exchange of information.
The German information showed that the German tax payer had not been assigned a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to reopen the taxation procedure.
The BRH found that, in this case, no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German tax payer had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the value-added tax thereon and also requested the reimbursement of the same amount of input tax.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German tax payer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German tax payer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax payers.
This change of name at the German tax office also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official verified the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax payer from a German tax payer to the value of €22,686.
Following a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ established that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax payer to ascertain whether the intra-community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax payer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax payer did not declare the intra-community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number intended for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax payer is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax payer.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax payer so that he could, if necessary, initiate appropriate taxation proceedings.
The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose value added tax on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, under German law, a tax payer supplying goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community supplies in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such a supply.
The supplier must only have the VAT number of the purchaser in the other Member State and be able to document the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply which should be subject to acquisition taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this transaction, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum limit of €15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax payer purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the framework of intergovernmental mutual assistance, the Czech financial administration requested an audit of this supply of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech tax payer stated that he had not received the goods, that he had never had any business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German tax administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - on the grounds that the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech tax official did not receive any documentation for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax assessment remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH determined that the German tax payer acted as a "fiscal representative" 17 (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax payer declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption was recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the replies of the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the replies of the Czech tax administration:
6. During its audit, NKÚ found that, on 5 October 2005, the Czech tax administration had sent a request for information on the value of goods delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax payer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer to the value of €86,307; however, the Czech tax payer declared only the purchase of goods to the value of €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.
In reply to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official used a SCAC form to request a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, on the basis of evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ noted that at the time of its examination, a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.
Following a request to the local tax officer, NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German tax payer to the value of CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax payer submitted a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany. It was established that the purchase of all the motor vehicles concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were resold to other tax payers in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare any intra-Community acquisition.
Through a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax payer did not file any tax returns even at the request of the tax official. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the value added tax liability for the period from October to December 2004 at zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the above-mentioned delivery from the German tax payer.
As the Czech tax payer did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
As the reply to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the completion of the NKÚ audit how the Czech tax officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
As a result of non-compliance with the provisions of the Czech Value Added Tax Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax payer was cancelled with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax official used a SCAC form to request a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004 for a value of €16,991, on the basis of evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices for deliveries to the value of €16,335 issued by the Czech taxpayer.
On the basis of the NKÚ request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA on the buyer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its preliminary VAT declarations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official used a SCAC form to request a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech tax payer in order to verify the deduction of above-average input taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax payer had declared in his VAT returns for the period in question the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114, and that the examination of the German FA with the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
In section 4.4.1, the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community purchases in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM are described.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic discrepancies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to the data from MIAS, the Czech tax payer purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German tax payer in the first quarter of 2005; however, the Czech tax payer did not declare this acquisition.
As the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the tax officer and there was no business activity at the legal domicile of the company, the Czech tax officer requested, within the framework of the international exchange of information, to verify how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech one.
The German reply to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax payer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarding agent.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer delivered only €21,659 worth of goods.
The Czech tax payer sent the German tax payer a false confirmation of payment for the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax payer.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech purchaser, the German tax payer, with the support of his other Czech clients, was able to recover the supplied material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
Following a request to the local authority in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech tax payer, the tax administration subsequently taxed sales of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
Following a request from NKÚ, BRH confirmed that, after corrections, the German supplier had reported only one shipment of goods to the Czech tax payer to the value of €7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax payer declared the reversal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.
His ZM contained the following information relating to the Czech taxpayers:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administration used a SCAC form to request a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer supplied the German taxpayer with goods with a total value of €396,126 and provided services with a value of €11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit of the Czech tax payer in order to investigate this shipment.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech tax payer had supplied and installed a production plant to the German one.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC, and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax payer did not take delivery of the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax payer charged the German for the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
Following a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ established that all invoices had been correctly entered in the books of the Czech tax payer.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax payer and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech tax administration, the locally competent FA concluded that these transactions constituted a uniform (goods) supply of the Czech tax payer to the German one, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the delivery of the work owes the value added tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount of VAT.
Since the turnover tax liability of the German tax payer remained unchanged, the German FA did not initiate a correction of the turnover tax return.
13. According to the MIAS data, Czech tax payer A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from German tax payer C in February 2005.
The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany for verification of this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer C had delivered this machine to Czech tax payer B in 2004, who, however, returned it to German tax payer C in October 2004.
According to information from the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the establishment of the German tax payer C in the Czech Republic.
It also emerged from the reply to the request for information that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the branch of the German tax payer in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
Following a request to the local tax officer responsible for tax payer B, NKÚ established that, according to the MIAS data, German tax payer C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
Tax payer B stated that he had not received the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with tax payer B, the tax official found that the machine with a value of €88,027 had not been booked with tax payer B and that it could be the same type of machine as that supplied by the branch of German tax payer C to Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the Czech tax officer with local responsibility for tax payer A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The tax official had the invoice of the German tax payer C dated February 7, 2005, in which the tax payer A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official found that tax payer A had not accounted for this invoice.
Tax payer A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also took care of the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of tax payer A.
The BRH found that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic but to another German tax payer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-liable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the entitlement of the German tax payer C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German controller D delivered the machine to the Czech controller B.
Under German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that the German tax payer C had indicated in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax payer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The following figure represents the contractual relations between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
In examining requests for information received, NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community supplies of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictive intra-Community supply of goods.
The German tax payer had not carried out any active business activity since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax payer.
The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim by the German tax payer against the German tax administration, which the Czech tax payer, as a shareholder in the German company, had asserted to the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far no information that the German tax administration is handling the case with reference to the Czech tax payer.
The available information indicates that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax payer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer supplied a Czech tax payer with goods with a total value of €33,205 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax payer and that the latter had personally collected the remaining goods.
Through a request to the local Czech finance official, the NKÚ established that the Czech tax payer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit of the Czech tax payer.
This audit has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech tax payer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the shipment.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax payer and the MIAS data.
In a request to the local Czech tax official, NKÚ found out that, after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax payer and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to discuss with the company owner the filing of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary sales tax return has been filed.
The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for setting VAT retroactively for the tax period in question would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxable person delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German taxable person.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for verification as to whether the aforementioned Czech tax payer actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax payer had set up a number of bogus companies in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax payer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax payer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax payer submitted receipts for the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax payer was not registered as liable for VAT in Germany and had not paid tax on the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official provided this information in his reply to the request for information to the German tax administration.
Following a request to the local Czech tax officer, NKÚ established that, following a tax audit, the Czech tax payer had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, inter alia, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax payer and at the same time exercised the right to deduct VAT for purchases from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return, which had been submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax payer and demanded the payment of VAT to the value of €1,600.
In addition, the competent IAs sent a control notice to the IAs responsible for the actual recipient of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question whether the Czech tax payer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.
Attached to the request for information was a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax payer.
As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had not had any contact with a German tax payer.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information, the Czech tax official responded to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
On request to the local Czech tax official, NKÚ established that the Czech tax payer does not have his registered office at the address specified in the Commercial Register and that the managing director of the company cannot be reached.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech tax payer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German tax official had rejected the claim of the German tax payer to exempt that delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was not in a position to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax payer was alleged to have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax payer did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of the deliveries and their payment within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax payer submitted a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely this shareholder of the company, after the managing director had been deleted from the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech tax payer informed the tax official that the owner of the capital had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax official recognised the Czech tax payer's entitlement to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States to the value of CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax payer.
Since the earlier external audit had shown no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic to the value of €4,251,196 in 2005, after having purchased goods to the value of €43,274 in the previous year.
The German tax payer declared the intra-Community acquisitions neither in his 2004 VAT return nor in that for the year 2005.
In addition, he did not declare baseline sales in terms of value.
Because of these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to verify whether the delivery notified by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
Documents provided to the NKÚ by the competent tax officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax payer, a record of the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005 was drawn up on 30 March 2006.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the tax officer to provide all the accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director had expired on 16 May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.
The Czech tax payer has not filed any sales tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two Courts of Auditors exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not established in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wished to conduct tax-liable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient in-house production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax payer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its own risk and for its own account.
Because of the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were supplied to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as liable for tax in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the supply of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the supply was intended is different from the home state of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany, and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM submitted to the German CLO.
As a result, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not notify intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community purchases in Austria, cooperation between at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and BRH examined case scenarios in order to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation of 2004.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for the taxpayers and the FÄ to apply the new legal requirements:
22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax payer.
During the same period, another Czech tax payer reported in his ZM intra-Community deliveries to another German tax payer for a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
From the information provided by the BRH to NKÚ, it emerged that in both cases electricity supplies were involved.
Both Czech tax payers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of NKÚ found that, in 2004, different legal regulations applied between the Czech Republic and Germany on the supply and purchase of electrical energy.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax payers declared the deliveries of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004 it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal provisions have been eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635 / 2004, which amended certain tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community supplies or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax payer declared intra-Community supplies to a German tax payer totalling CZK 240,411,163 in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and another Czech tax payer declared intra-Community supplies to another German tax payer totalling CZK 263,470,776 in his ZM for the same period.
Information provided by BRH to NKÚ showed that in both cases supplies of electrical energy had been involved.
In accordance with the wording of Law no. 235 / 2004 in force from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, place of business or place of business for which this supply is made.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have declared the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies resulted in a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Final note
Through cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NKÚ were achieved.
Both courts of auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing the VAT administration.
During the parallel investigations, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
With some of them it is worth further observation.
On the basis of the results of the audit, both courts drew up recommendations on the management of value added tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two courts of auditors will form the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the field of VAT administration.
