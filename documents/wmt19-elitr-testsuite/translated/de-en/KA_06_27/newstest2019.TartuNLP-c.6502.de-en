Report on the results of the parallel assessment of the Czech Republic and Germany's VAT administration
Preliminary remarks
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Courts of Auditors have the power to audit the entire public finances.
The declaration requires that the Courts of Auditors must have the power to assess tax collection as far as possible.
The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) regards taxation as an important component of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the Courts of Auditors.
One of the most significant steps towards optimising the audit work of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for public revenue audit.
This is particularly true of taxation as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national audit firms can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit firms of other countries.
An example can be the examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many countries.
Cooperation between authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Auditing bodies in this area must be ready to work closely together.
The idea of an audit of VAT and the MIAS system was developed at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating courts first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the analysis of the available information, we selected the audit subject matter for the audit plan.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual Member States (in particular EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and increase transparency in this area. dictate:
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but also provide the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel assessment of the Czech Republic and Germany's VAT administration
Introduction
Reference number: CZ) 06 / 27 (de) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject-matter of the examination:
 (CZ) VAT administration after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
 (De) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The Commission's audit objective is to:
 (CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as "EC") with free movement of goods and services, as well as the the MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
 (De) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the examination, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to address them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the use of information obtained through international mutual assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of VAT administration systems in both countries. dates.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared within the meaning of European guideline 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The period examined covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two Courts of Auditors.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects, such as registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary reports, were also examined.
The audit also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
The comparison of VAT administration systems in the two Member States revealed differences in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is to exceed the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, for the purposes of VAT, the taxable person receives a tax number only applicable to domestic transactions.
If the German taxpayer wishes to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT number.
Given the difficulties arising from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus.
In the Czech Republic, the international carriage of passengers by coach is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct the VAT.
In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the carriage is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation under Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax declarations.
Whereas in the Czech Republic taxable persons have to issue VAT returns only for sub-year tax periods (month or quarter), taxable persons have to issue VAT returns in Germany (monthly or quarterly) 
Submit VAT pre-notifications and an annual VAT declaration after the end of the calendar year.
Unlike the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany are required to submit VAT pre-notifications by electronic means.
The introduction of compulsory electronic VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary notifications.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the financial offices (Fä), German taxpayers have to submit the summary reports to the ClO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary notifications will be available to the Fä in the Czech Republic immediately after they have been submitted.
The information contained in the summary notices would only be available to Germans after processing it by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the update of the mias data.
This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduced the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In case of in-depth requests, the Czech CLO will monitor compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a consequence, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the prescribed period.
Because of these problems, the BRH recommended that the German CLO continuously monitor the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States must develop its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The Sao and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States; otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
In the framework of the cooperation, the two courts examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were examined jointly by exploiting the legal possibilities of the CLO, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Courts of Auditors noted that:
In some cases, the information obtained in the international exchange of information was used to re-establish the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In those cases, the taxable persons had either unlawfully claimed the exemption from VAT or had not indicated the purchase of goods in their declaration of VAT.
In some cases, the information obtained in the exchange of information could not be used because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legislative provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused the requested information.
Some cases have been identified where taxable persons have not correctly declared transactions in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the experts (the fä) had to identify in these cases (see 6).
Audit procedures
Audit procedures in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II – "government revenue" and the territorial audit departments Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance and the 10 Fä Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The audit findings were approved by the college of the Sao on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the audit area of traffic taxes and staff of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the Sao, the BRH had to announce the examination in several Länder.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the audit was carried out in the following Länder:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
The following tax acts were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, München II, IV und München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for Großunter Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
Talks were also held with the Fä Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the audit were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
A number of meetings of representatives of both Courts took place in the run-up to the parallel audit.
The participants in these meetings became familiar with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in each other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the May 2006 meeting.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
This meeting established a timetable for the subsequent procedure and identified the following audit topics for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.
2.
International passenger transport by bus – legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. international exchange of information, in particular financial officials' approach to the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problems mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. tax returns.
5.
Summary notifications.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
At a meeting to coordinate the further audit of the Sao and the BRH in December 2006, both sides became familiar with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel examinations already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal headquarters, headquarters or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive months shall be above the threshold on the first day of the third month following the month in which he exceeds the threshold. has taken steps to pay (§ 94 (1) of Act No 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter referred to as “Act No 235 / 2004 ”).
The applicant must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow a taxpayer to be registered retrospectively if he has exceeded the registration deadline.
A trader who is legally established, established or established in the Czech Republic, who provides services subject to VAT or exempt from VAT with the right to deduct from VAT must also be registered for VAT, if its turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million but fulfils other conditions set out in Law 235 / 2004.
A trader with a legal registered office, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down in the law may apply for registration for VAT on a voluntary basis.
With the receipt of the application for registration with the local competent financial officer, the registration procedure under Law 337 / 1992 begins.
Anyone who wishes to be registered on a voluntary basis must indicate in his application the date from which he applies for registration as a turnover taxable person.
The financial official shall examine the information supplied by the operator, i.e. the filled-in application for registration with all installations.
If the applicant has doubts about the information contained therein, he shall ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information given.
Where the financial officer has established by verification that the trader fulfils the conditions for registration, he shall issue a written notification of the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
The decision shall specify the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the investment period for the VAT.
The investment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached an amount of at least CZK 10 000 000.
If this is the case, the investment period shall be the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the preceding calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 shall be entitled to choose the calendar month as the investment period and shall inform the financial officials of this change.
The issuing of a tax number in the registration decision is always constitutional.
The taxable person must indicate the tax number in each communication (including payments) with the financial official, and in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law 235 / 2004 on the production of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the encoding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, where specified by a special law. in the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the business identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of the act No 337 / 1992).
If, despite the financial official's request, the trader fails to fulfil his obligation, the local financial official shall register him on his own initiative.
A notice is also given to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, each trader authorised to engage in a business will receive a tax number for each type of tax on its first registration.
This also applies to registration as VAT payers.
In accordance with Law 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register VAT, the financial official may require that the taxable person makes up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover, which the taxable person makes legally valid. has carried out without taxation for the period from the date on which the trader should have been registered as a taxable person until the date on which registration as a taxable person took place at the disposal of the financial official (Article 98 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
The payment of the amount thus fixed is considered as a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
In the event of the statutory conditions, registration of a turnover taxable person may be deleted for two reasons:
 (1) 
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly because turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (Article 106 (1) of Law 235 / 2004).
A taxpayer may request that his registration be cancelled at least one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
 (2) Cancellation of the registration on its own initiative (Article 106 (7) of Law 235 / 2004) where: (a) the taxpayer has not provided any benefit during the 12 consecutive months and has not informed the financial officials of the reasons for doing so, (b) the tax the obligor has not fulfilled its obligations under Law 235 / 2004; (c) the previous taxpayer no longer fulfils the conditions for tax liability.
 (B) taxable persons without a legal headquarters, registered office or premises in the Czech Republic a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and who is not legally established, established or established in the Czech Republic a permanent establishment or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who is required to make a tax declaration and pay taxes on such services or supplies in accordance with Article 108 of Law No 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes taxable on the provision of the service in question.
It must submit an application for registration with the Fa Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery concerned.
It is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT numbers assigned to it in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident trader applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service in the Czech Republic, the Fa Prague 1 shall register him retroactively because, pursuant to Law 235 / 2004, he shall register him on the day of the first taxable service provider. in the Czech Republic, sales tax has become compulsory.
In the event of a retroactive registration, the Prague 1 fa shall require the traders concerned to provide evidence (invoices or written explanations) for the proof of the performance.
Where a non-resident trader applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, the fa Prague 1 shall require the submission of the relevant contract documents.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the Fa Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany, with a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs registered as of 31 December 2005, 233 of whom were from Germany.
Pursuant to § 106 (9) of Law 235 / 2004, the financial official shall be empowered to withdraw the registration of a non-resident undertaking by 31 January of the following calendar year if he declares the obligation to submit tax declarations or – not accepted for tax purposes.
The audit of the Sao showed that, in the event of a tax return being sent by post abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for the submission of a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the Fa until 31 January. is.
In cases where those facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of registration, become known to the Fa later than 31 January, the registration of the non-resident trader for VAT in the Czech Republic shall be cancelled in the No more possible calendar year.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the order of duties (§ § 137, 138 AO), each operation must be notified to the municipality and / or the competent tax authority.
This notification shall be made no later than one month after the start of the business.
The municipality shall forward the notification to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax authority finds that a transaction has started but has not been notified, it may also register retroactively the taxpayer on its own initiative.
In Germany, taxable persons, whether they are resident or not, are required to register for VAT purposes if they fulfil the conditions set out in § 2 of the German VAT Act.
This does not depend on the level of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Entrepreneurs established abroad are particularly responsible for the fä.
For example, the Fa ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who have their headquarters in the Czech Republic.
A total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered as of 30 April 2004 and 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered as of 1 March 2006.
According to the BRH, these would often refuse, with special responsibilities, to register so-called "pseudo self-employed workers" residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed attempted to circumvent these restrictions by establishing their own business.
These (apparent) self-employed workers do not fulfil the conditions for recognition as entrepreneurs laid down in Paragraph 2 of the UstG, since they are generally dependent on a single contracting authority which determines their working time and the type of work performed.
To be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire of the relevant Fa and provide information on the undertaking and the activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all Fä in Germany.
It shall be processed either in special organisational units within the Fä or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax investment.
This form will be used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The establishment of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain specifications:
The first three paragraphs are the identification number of the competent Fa, the following three (or four) paragraphs indicate which department is competent within the Fa, the following five (or four) paragraphs are the identification feature of the taxpayer: the last paragraph is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT number in order to be able to operate tax-free intra-Community supplies.
It is allocated by the CLO on request when the trader is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT number is automatically allocated by the CLO when the taxable person declares intra-Community supplies in his VAT advance notices or in his VAT Annual Statement.
The VAT number consists of the country code (de) and a sequence of nine paragraphs.
The registration of an entrepreneur may be deleted: 1. on request (e.g. when he ceases business), but only after all tax operations have been completed (estimating all financial years) or 2. that he no longer operates.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the Fä must inform the CLO of the removal of the VAT number so that the VAT number can be terminated at that time.
According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) of the German VAT Act), domestic taxable persons are not required to pay a VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the VAT resulting therefrom did not exceed the amount of €17,500 and 2. the following is added: the amount is unlikely to exceed €50,000 per year.
Small businesses are not entitled to charge VAT to other businesses, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay VAT, small businesses are obliged to register with the tax office and make an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur may declare the non-application of Paragraph 19 (1) of the German VAT Act.
This declaration shall be binding for the next five years.
It may then charge VAT and deduct VAT.
Non-resident taxable persons may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a Ustst).
It is essential that they make exclusively tax-free transactions and refrain from deducting VAT.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign operator and does not have to be registered for VAT purposes.
The invoices shall state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation varies from one country to another.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold laid down in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he may be registered on a voluntary basis.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences may arise due to different organisational structures in the different Länder.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number shall also apply to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur registered for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for domestic German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply specifically for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the Sao and the BRH found that the German two-stage registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, awarded a single identification number for both the national registration of VAT and intra-Community transactions. may lead to serious misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxable person does not declare his business to the municipality or to the competent Fa.
This retroactive registration makes it possible to apply VAT correctly for previous investment periods, in particular for an accurate estimate of the VAT debt.
As different registration procedures cause problems, the rules should be harmonised for the whole of the EC.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Tax Office to any natural person after birth.
This number shall apply to natural persons residing in Germany for life.
Where a natural person takes up a business activity, the competent Fa shall apply for a commercial tax identification number which serves as VAT identification number.
There should therefore be no delay in the future between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT ID.
Work on the implementation of an it procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by coach
Legislative provisions in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to Article 70 of Law 235 / 2004, the movement of passengers between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT since 1 May 2004 and is entitled to VAT. movement.
The exemption from VAT shall also apply where the movement is carried out by persons registered in other Member States as taxable persons or by foreigners who are taxable domestically.
The return journey is considered as a separate transport operation.
If non-resident businesses do not carry out any economic activity in the Czech Republic other than the cross-border transport of passengers by coach, they are not obliged to register themselves in the Czech Republic as subject to VAT.
Under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Appendix V, Chapter 5 (1) (b) exempts cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic from the VAT obligation.
"For the purposes of the application of Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex f of the Directive, maintain the exemption for international passenger transport until the conditions laid down in Article 28 (4) of the Directive are fulfilled. the same exemption shall be applied by any of the current Member States or as long as it is applied."
The statutory provisions in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Paragraph 3b (1) of the UstG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the part of the domestic carriage is taxable in Germany.
Nor does German taxation distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) businesses.
If a non-resident taxable person carries passengers through Germany, the part of the carriage in Germany shall be considered as a taxable carriage.
Prior to the provision of its services in Germany, the non-resident undertaking must notify the competent Fa of its intention to provide passenger transport services.
It registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each motor coach referred to in the taxpayer's registration.
The trader must indicate his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
On 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered at Fa Chemnitz-Süd.
If the carriage service is provided to a domestic operator, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the Fa.
In its place, the domestic customer of services shall pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxable person, a transaction referred to as a "transfer of tax liability" and complies with Article 196 of the Directive. 2006 / 112 / EC of the Council.
In addition to the notification by a non-resident taxable person and his declaration of income tax, the German financial administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax declaration in respect of passenger transport:
Mobile customs control groups shall check the certificates of buses registered abroad used for the carriage of passengers through Germany.
After each audit, the mobile control groups shall submit an inspection report to the relevant Fa.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing.
The non-resident taxable person may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax liability indicated in his VAT return.
If the Fa has doubts as to the accuracy of a VAT declaration, it may order an audit to be carried out in the Fa or may use the means of mutual assistance provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Although the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the statutory VAT, the Fa may request mutual assistance under Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or the compliance of a non-resident bus undertaking with the tax obligation to be too burdensome in relation to the low income from the VAT on taxable persons promotions.
In particular, checking the books of a non-resident taxpayer involves disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language but also foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination is likely to involve a higher time burden than that of a resident taxpayer, although the examination is limited to passenger transport operations in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States where he carries out passenger transport.
In addition, for each Member State where only one passenger carriage is carried out, the taxpayer must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the different languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the relevant EC Member States.. "
This leads to disproportionate administrative burdens for the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation varies from one Member State to another.
In the Czech Republic, carriage of passengers between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route on the territory of Germany.
If a non-resident taxable person provides such transport services for the first time, he shall first notify the competent Fa.
It registers the taxable person who has to declare the taxable share of the carriage in a tax declaration in Germany.
Enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered at Fa Chemnitz-Süd have the purpose of carrying passengers.
The tax revenue in question is relatively low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States – which levy VAT pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover taxes – have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of imposing VAT, cross-border passenger transport should be taxable only in one Member State.
This could be the country where the transport starts or where the service provider is established.
Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT declarations
Issuing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless the law provides otherwise, the trader is obliged, even if no tax liability has arisen, to issue a VAT declaration on the form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.
The tax liability arises with the expiry of the deadline for the submission of the VAT return, with the exception of which, pursuant to Law 235 / 2004, the VAT on the importation of goods is the due date of the tax according to the customs rules.
If, consequently, there is a claim for reimbursement of above-average deductible taxes, this amount shall be reimbursed to the taxpayer within 30 days of the date on which the deduction is fixed without a request being made. needs to become.
The deadline shall not apply in cases where the financial official initiates a tax proceeding concerning the tax liability of the taxable person.
Pursuant to Article 73 (11) of Law No 235 / 2004, the right to deduct may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year during which the right to deduct has arisen.
After the expiry of this period, the deduction may be applied within three years of the end of the tax period during which the application would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
A amendment to Law 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct could have been claimed for the first time.
A taxpayer must make a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the amount of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax debt, (b) he makes corrections which do not alter the tax debt most recently known in accordance with Article 49 of Law 235 / 2004, it makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability.
A taxpayer may issue a supplementary VAT return if the amount of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must make the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts have been established.
The VAT return may be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of a data medium.
The levy on the Internet may be carried out with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on disks.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.
The value of the services concerned must be indicated in separate rows of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to persons registered there as taxable persons in other EC Member States shall be compared with the data provided by the Czech taxpayers in their summary notifications.
The value of the acquisitions of goods from other Member States by persons registered there as taxable persons shall be compared with the information contained in the summary reports of taxable persons from other EC Member States by means of the VIES.
Under the ATIS system, the Fa will carry out a credibility test of VAT returns.
This is done automatically because the VAT return cannot be processed without the previous examination.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
Pursuant to § 37 (1) of Act No 337 / 1992, the Fa may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law. income.
Automated tax information system – Automated tax information system used by Czech financial institutions to provide technical assistance for tax collection.
The Sao concluded that the fä rarely used the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxpayer concerned when the VAT return was not submitted.
Issuing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, there is a distinction between monthly or quarterly VAT notifications and the annual VAT declaration.
Those taxable persons who are obliged to submit VAT pre-notifications nevertheless have to submit an annual VAT return.
Even small businesses who are not obliged to pay VAT will have to make an annual VAT return.
In principle, taxable persons are required to submit a pre-notification of VAT by the 10th day following the expiry of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is charged (§ 18 (2) of the German VAT Act).
However, where the VAT debt was more than €6,136 in the previous year or is a newly established company, the trader shall be obliged to submit monthly VAT notifications at the latest by the 10th day following the end of the month in question.
The taxable person may also choose to submit monthly VAT notifications if he received a refund of more than €6.136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) of the German VAT Act).
If the annual turnover tax does not exceed €512, no VAT advance notifications or VAT returns shall be submitted.
A resulting VAT debt shall be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
Reimbursement may lead to a more thorough audit by the financial management.
There are no (statutory) time limits for the processing of VAT returns and for the reimbursement of VAT overpayments.
A guarantee for the amount of the refund may be offered in order to receive a prompt refund.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed swiftly.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (tax or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) of the German VAT Act).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-notifications and the corresponding payments may be submitted one month later, but in the case of monthly notifications a special advance payment shall be made.
This payment shall be charged against the VAT debt established for the pre-notification period of December.
If an error is detected, the trader must submit a corrected VAT pre-notification.
There is no "additional" VAT return.
Once the VAT return has been submitted to the tax office by 31 May of the following year, the trader may no longer correct an incorrect VAT return but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the taxable person's advantage or disadvantage shall be possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was made.
After this four-year period, a VAT return may normally be corrected only in the event of a slight tax cut or tax evasion.
Taxable persons must submit VAT pre-notifications by electronic means.
The Fä may grant derogations from this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return may be issued in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is effected without certification, the taxable person must make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
In the absence of VAT prior notifications or declarations, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover generated by the taxpayer6.
In the event of late taxation, the taxable person may be subject to a delayed surcharge (up to 10% of the tax debt or up to €25,000).
In a previous examination, the BRH found that the fä often does not raise this delayed surcharge.
In the cases where the delayed surcharges were levied, the amount was fixed in a different and arbitrary manner.
The purpose of the delayed surcharge is therefore not to reduce the average delay, in particular in the submission of the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines of information on intra-Community supplies or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the supply of services.
Non-taxable transactions shall be indicated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must be either scanned or recorded electronically by personnel specifically designated for that purpose.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After which all data are collected electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a selection of traps is made according to certain standards.
The sales tax returns thus selected must be verified by the competent expert on the basis of the automatically drawn up reviews (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration has to make only a rough estimate of the VAT debt, it nevertheless has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxable persons must submit their prior notifications at the latest 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the level of their tax debt in the previous year.
The VAT Annual Statement shall be issued by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to issue an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer may correct the errors in the monthly advance notifications by issuing a single VAT return;
– If the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be allocated to a specific MFF period;
– The Länder do not share MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the VAT Annual Declarations have normally been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must issue a VAT return regardless of the level of their turnover.
This obligation enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small businesses.
In addition, the competent Fa may compare the VAT Annual Statement with the corresponding statements for direct taxation and with the annual accounts of the undertaking concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only verify the level of turnover on the basis of the declaration of income tax.
In contrast to the rules in force in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are required to submit the VAT advance notice electronically.
The introduction of the compulsory electronic return in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary notifications
Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Article 102 of Law 235 / 2004, a trader who delivers goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State is required to submit summary reports (hereinafter referred to as the "CMO").
The value of the goods delivered shall always be indicated in the CMO in Czech currency, broken down by VAT number7, the individual taxable person under whom they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the MIP.
Taxable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period shall deliver the MTC to the locally competent Fa no later than the 25th day following the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data shall be corrected in a corrective arm within 15 days of the error detection.
Incorrect data in the MZM is always replaced by data from the MZM.
Similar to the tax returns, taxable persons may issue the MTC electronically.
Where a taxable person does not deliver a taxable amount or a corrective amount although he is obliged to do so under Law 235 / 2004, the financial official shall invite him to deliver the amount of the amount concerned, indicating the consequences of the non-taxation. the financial official has the power to impose fines of up to CZK 2 million on several occasions in accordance with Article 37 of Law No 337 / 1992.
In its audit, the Sao found that the Fä did not usually use its power to impose fines on its defaulting taxpayers.
In particular, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations in relation to the submission of the Mrs, since the failure to pay a Mrs does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Law 235 / 2004, the financial official is required to verify the information in the MIP or the Amending MIP, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax debt.
In case of non-conformity
8 of the information contained in the Mrs with which the taxpayer corrects false information in the Mrs by issuing an Mrs either on his own initiative or upon request.
The financial officer shall correct the data on the deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
– The taxpayer does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the MIP (or amending MIP) and therefore corrects it by submitting a corrective MIP;
– The financial official has demonstrated the incorrect information reported by the taxpayer in the MIP or the MIP.
The corrections issued by the financial officer without a corrective arm issued by the taxpayer do not replace the taxpayer's obligation to submit a corrective arm, but only lead to the correction of the data in the VIES, they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the MIPs shall be transmitted to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive such data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department of International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the O _ MCTL notification is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect VAT numbers indicated in the notified ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT identification number is used in some of the lines transmitted by the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry will be made in the list of the incorrect VAT identification number.
The list contains a "notice of doubts concerning VAT number."
The financial officer shall verify the data and enter the result of the verification into the system.
In the case of the acquisition of goods from another Member State, the taxable person shall indicate this in his VAT return and enter the value of the acquisition in the rows of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisitions made by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT declaration and those indicated by the supplier of the other Member State in his VAT system shall be examined by the CLO for the purposes of: competent Fa shall be forwarded.
The factory workers there must investigate the deviations.
There may then be three different situations:
 (A) The value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of its VAT return is lower than the value indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial official shall verify the correctness of the information.
 (B) The difference is zero.
This situation may be complemented either by a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its CMO) or by an amendment to the information contained in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer makes an own initiative in the meantime). declaration of VAT AB).
In this case, it is the discretion of the financial official to verify the correctness of the information contained in the VAT return.
 (C) the value of the goods acquired from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods supplied by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Again, it is in the discretion of the financial official to verify the correctness of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their appearance, the financial official shall submit the results of his review to ATIS.
These results will be transmitted to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination is shown in Figure 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance) for each quarter of 2005.
Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO has decreased for each quarter of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, inter alia, to the fact that the Czech CLO raised the threshold for selecting falls, taking into account the minimum threshold for requesting information to the other EC Member States. has adopted.
Divergences between the information contained in the VAT returns and the data contained in the EC do not always have to be based on a mistake made by the domestic acquirer.
There may also be a mistake made by the taxpayer in another Member State or a mistake caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries are indicated differently in each EC Member State.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions in the Fä assessed are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary notifications in Germany
Traders operating intra-Community supplies from Germany to other EC Member States or participating in triangular transactions are required to deliver quarterly ZM in which intra-Community supplies are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) of the UstG).
It shall be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter concerned.
Where a duration extension is granted for the submission of VAT pre-notifications, this shall also apply to the MTC.
The CMOs shall be delivered to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, electronic taxation has been compulsory.
The competent Fa may allow exemptions for individual taxable persons in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the taxable person finds that the MZM was incorrect, he shall be obliged to submit a MZM within one month.
In the event of the failure to deliver the ZM, the CLO shall initiate an oral suspension procedure.
This includes the following steps: – first reminder – second reminder, accompanied by the threat of a penalty payment and the setting of the penalty payment.
Although the German tax rule allows the fixing of a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (section 329 AO), the CLO sets penalties of €125, €250 and €500 in three stages.
In addition, Paragraph 26a (1) (5) of the Ustst provides that a taxable person is unlawful if he intentionally or easily does not give a taxable amount correctly, in full or in time or if he does not give a taxable amount or if he does not justify a taxable amount. corrected.
This infringement can be penalised with a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered by the Fä in the MIAS because the processing of the ZM is exclusively the responsibility of the CLO.
The data of the ZM are only stored with the CLO.
The information from the summary notifications shall not be available until it has been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for the processing of MZs are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM shall be stored within three months after the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the event of an incorrect VAT number in the MZ of German taxpayers, the German CLO receives a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant Fa.
It will then be its task to request the correct information.
In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the U.S. ID number at the request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, threatening and setting of up to three consecutive penalties takes too much time when a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases which were ultimately notified to the competent fä were normally closed within one to two months.
In 73% of these cases, the competent Fa refused tax exemption for notified intra-Community supplies9.
If the taxpayer submitted the correct VAT number, the Fa asked him to submit a corrected MZM to the CLO, because the MZM cannot correct the MZM data itself.
The BRH found that neither the Fä nor the CLO controlled the submission of the corrected MZs.
Therefore, taxable persons often failed to comply with the request. as the CLO does not have access to the data contained in the VAT returns, no comparison is made between the information contained in the VAT returns and the VAT returns on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the CMO before the data is transmitted to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the Fä, which is usually done when preparing a special VAT assessment.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT numbers are recognised and notified to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the purpose of controlling the acquisition tax in the Fä.
Once available in the system, it aligns the CLO with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications shall be drawn up and sent to the competent FAS.
This is done on a continuous basis, whereas a list of the employment data of all taxable persons will be drawn up later and forwarded to the Fä.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment process then compares this data with that for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully (only) verifies those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered in another Member State for sales tax must submit a MTR to the locally competent Fa.
The Fä process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community supplies reported by taxable persons in the MIP shall be compared with the values of intra-Community supplies indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the comparison will be taken into account in the tax setting.
In Germany, taxable persons who have carried out intra-Community supplies are required to pay quarterly MZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, taxpayers have had to submit the MTC electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM will not be available until they have been processed by the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the taxable persons in the MZ indicate only the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not indicated in the MIP; unlike the Czech MIPs, Germany cannot correct the incorrect information in individual lines of the MIPs submitted.
Because of this restricted access to German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the taxpayer communicated the correct VAT ID to the Fa.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community supplies made by German taxable persons in their VAT advance notifications with that of the relevant taxable person.
Differences between the pre-notification data and the CMO are not regularly revealed before the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the fry, it is clear that a comparison would improve the reliability of the data transmitted to the fry.
The data transmitted by other Member States on the supply of goods to Czech taxable persons is compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the acquisitions of goods indicated by Czech taxable persons in their VAT declarations.
The Czech CLO carries out the compensation separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations shall be referred to the Fa.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control shall only be carried out in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons only if the RMS has prepared an audit report or if the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the fä from clarifying the reasons for the differences that arise.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated data on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current CMO system, in particular the VIES system, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to issue monthly MZs.
The monthly levy would only significantly increase the bureaucratic burden, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or advance notifications and are no longer required to submit information on the VAT. it is necessary as for VAT declarations or advance notifications.
In order to avoid bureaucratic burdens, the taxation of VAT could be linked to the issuing of VAT returns or advance notifications.
However, a monthly reporting obligation would lead to more periodic discrepancies between data on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community acquisitions and would increase the flow of data between CLOs.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly MZs.
Implementation failed in the concerns expressed by the Länder.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the monthly submission obligation to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly submission at European level, allowing for a monthly update of the MiAS data.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the main business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total sales of intra-Community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany are presented in Table 2.
Both Courts requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT numbers in the O _ MCTL notifications, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter audited.
These data are presented in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different basis for calculating the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO relates the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was delivered, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTLM was delivered.
International exchange of information at level 3
Carrying out the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information enables financial officials, other Member States to obtain information on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who have carried out them.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter referred to as “Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 ”), distinguishes between two basic types of information exchange. exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information upon request takes place through a request for information (RFI) using the standardised SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic shall send their RFI or their responses to a received RFI by the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which shall ensure the translation into the foreign language of the information provided in the standardised SCAC format and the transmission to the other Member States. dates.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the replies to requests sent, which are translated into Czech and distributed to the competent Fä for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 lays down a maximum period of three months from the receipt of the request for processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the Sao.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (74.5%) were handled within the three-month period and in 23 other cases (24.5%) this period was exceeded.
In the remaining case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the audit by the Sao. more detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests submitted by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
Out of a total of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 (i.e. 40.6%) responded within the three-month period; another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were handled after the end of that period. and in 19 cases, the audit by the Sao had not yet received a reply from Germany (in the remaining case, the information provided did not determine when Germany responded to the request for information).
More detailed information on the deadlines for responding to requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graph 4.
The above graph shows that the transactions audited in relation to requests for information were mostly valued at over €60,000.
The international exchange of information without a prior request shall take place either automatically, in a structured manner or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for the determination of the VAT debt.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between Member States shall take place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular intervals, fixed in advance, without prior request.
“Structured automatic exchange ” means the systematic transmission of previously established information to another Member State without its prior request once the information concerned is available.
The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on the supply of new vehicles.
This information shall be obtained by the financial officer from the form of the notification of the delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to Article 19 of Law 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer shall enter the necessary data in the relevant document and forward it directly to the relevant financial management staff, where the data are collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. this data shall be transmitted to the other Member States within the prescribed period, no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic shall also provide information to the other Member States on transit transactions which are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions which appear to be inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."
This information shall be transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC preliminary text in the course of a spontaneous exchange of information.
Carrying out the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the locally competent Fa.
The Fä shall send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which shall forward the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The Fä are required to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACV form used is one-lingual.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were submitted in order to ensure taxation of employment in the other Member State or to demonstrate the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall examine whether the value of the supplies referred to in the request exceeds the minimum threshold of €15 000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum threshold.
In addition, the German CLO concerns the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC pre-print [ (B1-17) or (e) ] if they are not written in either German or English.
In response to the request for information, the CLO shall forward it to the relevant Fa, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines are set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO does have the technical means to monitor the retention of fristein, it does not have the necessary staff capacity to remind the Fä of the response to the unfinished requests for information.
The fä shall receive the necessary information by writing to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.
The auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT reviews, which may only apply to: a recent transaction is involved.
This short and flexible form of audit does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proved its worth in the analysis of an individual turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany shall provide the other Member State with the following information: – on VAT number assigned to companies established in other EC Member States – on the reimbursement of VAT to companies established in other EC Member States are established.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information in the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. the delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT number, b. distance selling (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant differences between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the purchases reported by and e. potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions independently of intra-Community transactions sent to other Member States, i.e. intra-Community supplies of goods unduly subject to taxation by the taxpayer in Germany whether their VAT ID number is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential “missing traders ” or customers who have abused a VAT ID number.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information shall be sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent authorities who transmit the corresponding SCACV forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACV prints (Czech-English) and translates the information provided into English or German, the Germans follow the instructions, requests for information or spontaneous information on an establishment. to be written in German only.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the Sao found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of requests for information received within the three-month period, while addressing Germany. requests for information from the German financial administration were received only in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO points to the fä for the three-month period, it does not monitor compliance.
The absence of memories leads to a high proportion of temporary requests for information.
The BRH therefore recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the financial offices of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the field of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The VAT Methodology and Economic Administration Department or its Risk Management Unit will look into the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenues and evaluate trends in these risks in national and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the criterion of "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates non-risk goods, prepares risk management in the field of VAT in a conceptual way and cooperates in this field with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The International Sales Tax Assistance Department shall, inter alia, provide for the exchange of information, contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a relevant information database, assess the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, disclose to the public and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental mutual assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The Tax Examination and Taxation Methodology Department shall carry out risk analyses, inter alia, in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of the cases to be examined, establishes risk analyses on the fight against tax evasion and collects in this context information from financial management and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax paying agencies exist within the financial directorates, including the search for taxpayers and sectors that are risk-sensitive to the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. internet shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for non-registered taxpayers (e.g. Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), investigation of chain fraud interconnections and information to local financial authorities.
In 12 selected fä, special testing units have been established.
They shall have regional competence and shall carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the Fä on the basis of the appropriate authorisation.
The need for the establishment of special testing units resulted from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion identified, particularly in relation to chain transactions.
These special units are considered according to the needs of taxpayers or focused on taxpayers with certain activities, multinationals and taxpayers with particularly high revenues.
The following mechanisms to reduce VAT risks have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the task of “credibility of VAT returns ” to assess the risk-admissibility of tax returns issued, – the task of“ selecting the returns to be verified ” taxable persons ," whereby the taxable persons to be examined are selected on the basis of certain criteria," the task of "mias," which allows financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The “mias ” task allows, inter alia, the following: – verification of the validity of the VAT identification number of taxable persons from other Member States, – confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, such as the VAT number of suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other Member States have been indicated, – establishment of a list of taxable persons who have not submitted a taxable amount, – formal control of the information supplied by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their taxable amount; before this information is transmitted to other Member States, – establishment of a list of taxable persons whose VAT returns do not conform to the information contained in the MTC on the supply of goods to other Member States, – establishment of a list of taxable persons where the VAT returns do not correspond to the value of the goods acquired from other Member States in the MTC of all their suppliers from other Member States13.
As part of their tasks to combat tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land register, vehicle register, trade register, etc.
More details can be found in section 4.4.1 on the issue and processing of summarised notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Because of their federal structure, in the Federal Republic of Germany, both the Federal Authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 Länder are involved in the development and implementation of an RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the Länder's financial administrations have a completely uniform database.
At the level of the CLO, the St I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as "Kuss" - the coordinating body for exceptional VAT reviews and tax reviews) collects the assessment of fraud cases in the Opus database.
In cooperation with the countries, a further database called Zauber has been established at the kiss, where financial offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters.
The kiss coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the kiss will be brought into the development of the RMS through its participation in the working groups.
Experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. of other Member States appearing in the ZM of German taxpayers will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review will be carried out prior to the transmission of the MZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MZM data and thus its benefits (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT number mentioned in the MIP will be assessed on the basis of the O _ MCTL calculations submitted by the other Member States (see also 4.4.2 for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT number).
In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the mias data transmitted by the other Member States and generates different types of messages to discover suspected missing traders. appearance.
The Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany are required to prepare these communications and have to transmit the outcome of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The fry audit confirmed that all available features need to be included in order to deal with a sufficient likelihood of a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH recommended that the BMF work on the preparation of the notifications with combinations of different evidence.
The risk management system should also take into account other elements, such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour, the business sector or the company's participation.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the Länder and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-notifications and annual declarations.
For example, the system draws up a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT advance notification or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete delivery of the CMO.
Furthermore, this type of risk management compares the acquisitions indicated by the taxable person in his annual VAT return with the data in the VIES.
The financial administrations of the Länder avoid comparing the quarterly data as they would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud, e.g.:
– Supplier and purchaser shall proceed from different times for the implementation of intra-Community transactions;
– Different accounting records and tax declarations of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the figures from the VAT returns with the MiAS data, many Länder have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the VAT returns and certain other elements (e.g. corporate wording, age of the In). owner / shareholder, number of employees and method of payment of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as “risk managers ”) to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out. will.
This system is used when the VAT notifications are processed by the Fä.
As a result, the competent Fa shall receive the instructions of the RMS before the VAT is fixed.
Since this system is not learnable, risk managers must adapt the rules according to the feedback received from the Fä.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of revealed cases of evasion.
On the basis of these data, RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system establishes a monthly list of tax cases where evidence of tax evasion is available.
On the basis of this list, the competent fä shall decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests he has proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on many data from processed VAT returns and some other evidence, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the datamining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.
It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the taxable persons concerned choose to be audited and report the results of the audit to the data centre concerned.
The introduction of these three RMSs is under way in the Länder.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be appropriate.
It remains to be seen whether the expected effects will come to an end when actually used.
Comparison and evaluation
Although the present report does not address the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the Sao and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German Länder, the RMS of each European State has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – particularly carousel fraud – has proved to be a problem not a national one, but a European one.
The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State, and if not, fraudsters will seek the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by pan-European VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in fraud may be affected.
There should therefore be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual transactions In the context of the parallel audits, the Sao and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or services.
Purchase, which was the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two invoicing bodies jointly examined the handling of several deliveries of which there were doubts or which the taxable persons of both states declared differently in the tax returns or in the tax return.
At the request of the BRH, the Sao examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, the Sao assessed the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, as indicated by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and tax returns, on the basis of notifications from the BRH.
At the request of the Sao, the BRH verified 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases revealed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth €60,500 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech taxpayer declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech financial administration sent Germany a request for information in order to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In response to the Czech request for information, the German side indicated that the German taxpayer concerned had goods worth €27.381 in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31.997 in the third quarter and goods worth €31.997 in the fourth quarter of 2004. quarter delivered worth €10,276.
The answer also showed that the German taxpayer's VAT ID was only valid from 28 September 2004, but the German CLO had accepted another request from the German taxpayer and the validity of the USt ID was retroactive to the 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the MZ.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
By a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that in 2004 the Czech taxpayer had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (sub-year) tax periods in which it had declared a higher value of acquisitions from other Member States while at the same time seeking to deduct input tax from acquisitions from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent staff of the Czech financial authority could not clearly determine whether the purchases declared included the value of the supplies of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the Sao, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as a taxable person in September 2003.
Each time he registered, he did not apply for the allocation of a VAT number, but only a tax number which would apply to Germany.
Although it is not normally possible in Germany to assign a VAT number retroactively to a taxpayer, this was done retroactively by the German financial administration's competent expert in 2006 as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO agrees a VAT ID number retroactively if the clear trader has not caused the delayed allocation, e.g. if the CLO caused the delay following the taxpayer's request to grant a VAT ID number.. "
In that case, the CLO grants the VAT number retroactively because the trader does not need a valid VAT number for intra-Community supplies under Paragraph 6 of the Ustst.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT number of its supplier to explain the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these differences in procedures between Member States, the German CLO granted the VAT number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial official requested a review of the VAT registration of the German operator.
The MIAS data constitute the date of registration of 5 March 2005, whereas the registration certificate issued by the locally competent German Fa is 1 October 2004.
The German authorities announced in their reply that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004 but had only received a VAT number in Germany on 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons.
By request to the Czech financial officer responsible, the Sao learned that the financial officer carried out a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005. had.
In the course of this examination, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT declaration services worth CZK 9,897 which he had supplied to the German taxpayer before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October). 2004).
The (Czech) tax office imposed a tax debt of CZK 1,880 on the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the Sao's request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had received the VAT number only when he notified the company that was founded in 2004 to the Fa on 16 February 2005.
In addition, it was registered retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the submission of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxpayer indicated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. in its VAT return for September 2004 and its Mrs for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer made goods deliveries worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxpayer.
When verifying the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS system, the Czech financial officer found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods were delivered to Germany.
The Czech taxpayer issued a supplementary VAT return in which he declared transactions from domestic supplies worth CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777 which he paid.
By a request to the locally competent Fa in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted an application for resumption of the taxation procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return as evidence. confirmed by the German financial administration that the German taxpayer had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech financial official verified the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the context of the international exchange of information.
The German information showed that the German taxpayer was only assigned a VAT number on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
Consequently, the Czech financial official rejected the request for the resumption of the taxation procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German taxpayer had only received a VAT number on 11 November 2004.
The German beneficiary, however, declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the sales tax, and also demanded the reimbursement of taxes at the same level.
Since this did not lead to a change in the amount of the German taxpayer ’ s debt, the German financial official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
The BRH also noted that the German taxpayer's company mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, leading to confusion between two German taxpayers.
This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech financial officials.
4.
In the context of the international exchange of information, German financial officials reviewed the acquisition of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxpayer from a German taxpayer worth €22.686.
By a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that the Czech financial official had carried out an external audit of the Czech taxpayer to determine whether the intra-Community delivery was effective. it was done and whether the Czech taxpayer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier indicated in the invoice not its VAT number but only its tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxpayer is not registered for VAT on intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech financial official also asked that the German financial administration should send a copy of the German taxpayer's registration certificate so that it could initiate a corresponding taxation procedure.
The Czech Fa regarded this business as the acquisition of goods by a non-business (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose any VAT on the acquisition of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, under German law, a taxable person who supplies goods to other Member States does not need to have a VAT number for intra-Community supplies in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such supplies.
The supplier must only have the VAT number of the acquirer in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question in the other Member State.
In this case, sales under German tax law are (tax-free) intra-Community supplies which should be subject to labour taxation in the Czech Republic.
It is important, however, that the Czech financial official took note of this transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not a core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum threshold of €15 000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth €12,561 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the context of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this supply of goods by means of a SCAC preliminary ruling.
The Czech taxpayer declared that he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and had not booked the purchase of the goods in question.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – because the turnover was below €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech financial official did not receive any documentation for subsequent taxation of the goods acquired, the tax audit remained unsuccessful and the original tax setting remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the Sao, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative" 17 (§ 22 (a) - (e) of the UststG).
The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his VAT declaration and in the Mrs.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
Following the communication from the BRH, the German Fa will send the documents needed for the subsequent taxation of the goods acquired to the Czech Republic.
Section 4.6.1 shows that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month deadline more frequently than the responses of the Czech financial administration:
6. during its examination, the Sao found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had sent a request for information on the value of deliveries to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the Mrs for this quarter, the German taxpayer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €86.307; However, the Czech taxpayer declared for the same period in his VAT declaration only the value added tax (b) goods worth €35,314.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum treatment period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German party informed that the request for information could not be processed. since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German financial administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. in 2005, a Czech financial officer requested the review of a third and fourth quarter of 2004 supply of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth €1,255,554 by means of a SCAC preliminary ruling, with evidence of: carousel fraud.
The Sao found that a German response to the request for information had not yet been received at the time of its examination.
By a request to the local financial officer, the Sao found that the Czech taxpayer had not declared in his VAT declaration the delivery of new motor vehicles to these German taxpayers worth CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech financial officer corrected the information contained in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer issued a corrected MZ.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not pass on this request for information to the locally competent Fa for examination.
Following the communication from the BRH, a special VAT assessment was carried out with the German acquirer in Germany, which found that the purchase of all the relevant motor vehicles had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles had been taxed on other taxable persons. continued sales in Germany.
8. according to the MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer acquired a car worth €48,500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
Upon request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that the Czech taxpayer had no longer issued a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not issue tax returns, even on request by the financial official, which led the Fa to set the VAT debt at zero on 23 May 2005 for the period October to December 2004.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the said delivery by the German taxpayer.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the financial official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
As the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the end of the audit by the Sao how the Czech financial official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Because of the failure to comply with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the registration of the Czech taxpayer was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only one partial reply was sent because at the time of the audit of the Sao and the BRH the competent Fa had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial official requested, by means of a SCAC preliminary ruling, the review of the supply of motor vehicles to a German taxable person worth €16.991 in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud. presented.
In his reply to the request for information, the German financial official indicated that only the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer on deliveries would be worth €16,335.
On the basis of the Sao's request, the BRH found that the German Fa's external audit of the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth €16,335 twice in his VAT advance notifications for the months of August and September 2004.
10. in 2005, a Czech financial officer requested, by means of a SCAC preliminary ruling, a review of the supply of motor vehicles to a German taxable person worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, including: carrousel fraud labels.
The German financial administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic confirming that the German taxpayer had acquired several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany was not yet completed.
The Sao found that the locally competent Fa had carried out several external audits with the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of above average high taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States for the period concerned for a total value of €579,114 and that the German Fa ’ s assessment of the acquisition in Germany had not yet been completed. is closed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the VAT declaration of the beneficiary and the information in the supplier's VAT declaration.
In the cases examined, it appeared that periodic inconsistencies18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11.
According to MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth €35,716 from the German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the financial official and did not carry out any business at the company ’ s legal headquarters, the Czech financial official requested a review in the context of the international exchange of information, such as the German taxpayer. had communicated with the Czech.
The German reply to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address indicated and the goods were collected by an agreed carrier.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer delivered only goods worth €21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer a wrong confirmation of payment of €155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
After discovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer managed to recover the supplied material, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, with the exception of a part of the value of €7,916.
By a request to the locally competent Fa in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech taxpayer, the financial administration subsequently taxed, inter alia, the turnover of goods delivered from other Member States. the amount was CZK 388.522.
Following a request from the Sao, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the withdrawal of the supply and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the withdrawal.
Its MIPs contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the review of the supply of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 through a SCAC agreement.
According to the request for information, the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxpayer with goods worth €396.126 over the period in question and provided services worth €11.885.
The Sao found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit of the Czech taxpayer to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration informed that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and assembled a production plant to the German.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer did not withdraw the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer calculated the German production facility for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them either.
Upon request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that all invoices were duly recorded in the Czech taxpayer's books.
The declarations of VAT for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after the first quarter of 2004.
The BRH noted that the locally competent Fa concluded on the basis of the reply from the Czech financial administration that these transactions concerned a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German taxpayer, including those carried out assembly.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called delivery of the plant is the place where the plant is assembled.
The German beneficiary of the supply of goods owes the VAT according to the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the beneficiary may claim a deduction of the same amount.
As the German taxpayer ’ s VAT debt remained unchanged, the German Fa did not cause the VAT declaration to be corrected.
13. according to the MIAS data, Czech taxpayer a acquired a machine worth €58,000 from German taxpayer C in February 2005.
The Czech financial official sent a request to Germany to review this information.
In response to the request for information, the German party informed that German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but had returned it to German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not returned to Germany but to the establishment of German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information further showed that German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to Czech taxpayer a in February 2005.
The latter accepted the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's establishment in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to a) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
By request to the local financial officer responsible for taxpayer B, the Sao found that according to the MIAS data, German taxpayer C in the third quarter of 2004 was worth the Czech taxpayer's goods (another machine) of €88.027.
Taxpayer B declared that he had not received the goods, so that the Czech financial officer responsible sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigation with taxpayer B, the financial officer found that the machine was not booked in the value of €88.027 by taxpayer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the German taxpayer's establishment. C was delivered to Czech taxpayer a in February 2005.
The Sao further found that the Czech financial official responsible for taxpayer a had carried out an audit at the Sao.
The financial officer had the invoice of German taxpayer C of 7 February 2005, in which taxpayer a is the recipient of the machine.
The Czech financial official found that taxpayer a had not booked the bill.
Taxpayer a had concluded a leasing contract with another Czech company whose subject-matter was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also carried it.
The Czech Fa did not use the information provided in response to the request for information to determine the tax debt of taxpayer a.
The BRH found that German taxpayer C had delivered the machine worth €88.027 not to the Czech Republic but to another German taxpayer d.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German financial official did not recognise the claim of the German taxable person C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax declaration.
German taxpayer d supplied the machine to Czech taxpayer B.
Under German law, this supply was not taxable in Germany but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH further noted that German taxpayer C had indicated in its Mrs for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a €58,000 machine to Czech taxpayer a.
This delivery was not verified during the tax audit carried out by the German Fa.
The figure below shows the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the Sao found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had received a request for information from Germany in which a German financial official verified the intra-Community supplies of a German taxpayer worth 879. asked a Czech taxpayer for €680,625.
The German financial official said that it was suspected of being a fictional intra-Community supply of goods.
Since 1999, the German taxpayer has not engaged in an active business activity.
The Sao found that the Czech financial official had carried out an audit of the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company argued that this was probably a claim by the German taxpayer against the German financial administration, which the Czech taxpayer had claimed as a shareholder in the German company at the German Fa.
According to the information provided to the Sao, the Czech financial officer has not yet received any information that the German financial administration is dealing with the case in relation to the Czech taxpayer.
The information available shows that it did not constitute a delivery of goods; Nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to include intra-Community acquisitions in the tax statements of the beneficiaries (see section 4.4.1 below):
15. according to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer for the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, totalling €33.205.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech financial official requested an examination of the supply of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In response to this request for information, the German party declared that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the other goods had been collected personally.
By enquiry with the Czech national official responsible, the Sao found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period concerned before receiving a reply to the request for information.. "
Nevertheless, the differences in purchase values could not be clarified, so the Czech financial official recommended a tax audit on the Czech taxpayer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. according to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only €14,856.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial officials asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.
The German answer to this question provided three invoices showing a total value of €31,999 for the goods delivered, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
Upon request to the locally competent Czech financial officer, the Sao found that, after receiving the reply from Germany, the Sao had contacted the accounting officer of the Czech taxpayer and remained with her in such a way that, after verifying the invoices, she would: the company owner wanted to discuss the issue of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
No additional VAT return has yet been issued.
The Czech financial official informed the Sao that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactive VAT setting for the tax period would be respected.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German taxpayer.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial officer asked to verify whether the aforementioned Czech taxpayer actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer established a number of scheduled companies in Germany. had.
The Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods in the course of the verification of the transaction by the Fa.
According to the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not delivered by Germany to the Czech Republic but resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer submitted evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as a taxable person in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts indicated tax evasion within Germany and the Czech financial official provided this information in response to the request for information to the German financial administration.
Upon request to the Czech financial officer responsible, the Sao found that the Czech taxpayer had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 following a tax audit carried out, which included: declared the value of the goods which he had acquired from a German taxpayer and, at the same time, invoked the right of deduction for the acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT declaration, he did not report any VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return issued after the external audit, the Czech financial official imposed an unchanged VAT liability.
The Czech legislation did not provide for the acquisition of goods from other Member States, since the goods were not shipped or transported by another Member State to the Czech Republic.
The Czech financial official thus concluded the wrong approach to the audit.
The BRH noted that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, the German financial officer corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and requested the payment of a turnover tax of €1,600.. "
In addition, the competent Fa sent a control notice to the Fa responsible for the actual recipient of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of those goods is duly taxed.
In the following cases, operators declared intra-Community supplies which may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech financial official received a request for information from the German financial administration on whether the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by a copy of the Czech taxpayer's VAT registration certificate as an annex.
A photocopy of the passport of the person who should have carried the vehicle was attached as a further appendix.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the passport had been stolen, that the person mentioned therein had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and indicated that he had no contacts with a German taxpayer.
The VAT registration certificate, whose print had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech financial official responded to the request for information and at the same time declared that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
Upon request to the locally competent Czech financial officer, the Sao found that the Czech taxpayer did not have his registered office at the address indicated in the trade register and that the managing director of the company could not be reached.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech financial official set the tax debt of the Czech taxpayer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial official found that the vehicle had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial officer had rejected the German taxpayer's right to exempt this supply from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.
19. during an external audit, a German Fa was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods acquired in the VAT return and the value reported from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the MiAS data, the German financial official requested, in the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the verification of supplies and their payment.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech financial official indicated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the trade register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was supposedly a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer made a declaration of VAT and a taxpayer which had been signed by an unauthorised person, that shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the trade register.
The accounting officer of the Czech taxpayer informed the financial official that the owner had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euro on the company's account.
No cash receipts have been issued.
By request to the locally competent Czech Fa, the Sao found that the financial official had the right of the Czech taxpayer to exempt VAT on goods deliveries to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416 in the first quarter of 2004. recognised CZK 180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German financial official did not correct the German acquirer ’ s VAT return, since a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous audit did not show any evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of being able to actually collect a fixed VAT debt.
20. according to the MIAS data, in 2005 a German taxpayer acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251.196, after which he acquired goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions either in his 2004 VAT return or in the for 2005.
In addition, it did not declare any corresponding initial transactions.
Because of these inconsistencies, the German Fa requested information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the MZ for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods worth CZK 167.246.083.
The request for information was received on 6 September 2006, in which the German party requested that it examine whether the delivery notified by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company had no managing director (or other legal representative).
It is apparent from the documents submitted to the Sao by the responsible financial officer that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer on 30 March 2006, a protocol on the start of the sales tax audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January 2004 it was established until December 2005.
At the same time, the taxpayer was invited by the financial official to submit all accounting and tax documents for that period, but this was the case.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the only managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech taxpayer no longer issued VAT returns since April 2006.
In the context of the parallel examination, the Sao, in cooperation with the BRH, examined several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not subject to prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two Courts exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.
21. a Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the relevant Fa (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to operate taxable transactions in Germany.
On the basis of this information, the company was registered as of June 2005 but did not receive a German VAT number.
The (UCR) accepted a contract by a Danish company (UdK) for the production and delivery of wind turbines to Austria on behalf, at the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacity, the Danish company passed a part of the contract to a German taxpayer established in Germany (ude).
The following figure illustrates the contractual relationships and transport routes of wind turbines:
Under German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
– The Danish company (UdK) sent the wind turbines on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account, for assembly to Austria.
As a result of the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the supply of wind turbines is taxable in Austria.
– Because the carrier was commissioned by the Danish company (UdK) and the latter had the transport carried out on its own behalf, at its own risk and on its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (Au) and the recipient is registered as a taxable person in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be applied for the delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE). since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from that of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
– The supply of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
– The supply of the other wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) had not declared intra-Community supplies either in its German tax returns or in its ZM to the German CLO.
Consequently, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The Sao found that (UCR) had not reported intra-Community deliveries to Austria but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case no indication of tax fraud or tax evasion would be required. available.
In addition, the Sao and the BRH examined case arrangements to indicate the size of the differences caused by the different legislation of 2004 between the figures in the VAT returns and the MiAS data.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the taxpayers and the new legislation to apply:
22. in its MZ for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxpayer reported goods to a German taxpayer for a total value of CZK 792.977.452.
During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in his MZs for a total value of CZK 18.157.265.
The information transmitted by the BRH to the Sao showed that both were electricity supplies.
Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries under Czech Law 235 / 2004 in force in 2004.
When further examining these transactions, an audit group of the Sao found that in 2004 different legislative provisions on the supply and purchase of electricity between the Czech Republic and Germany were applicable.
While in the Czech Republic taxable persons declared the supply of electricity as intra-Community supplies in accordance with the provisions of Law No 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, the provisions of the German legislation in force in 2004 did not constitute a Community acquisition of goods, but for taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legislation were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law 635 / 2004, which amended certain tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. in the examination of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further found that a Czech taxpayer in its Mrs for the first and fourth quarter of 2005 made intra-Community supplies to a German taxpayer. the total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech taxpayer in its MZ declared intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer for the same period of CZK 263,470,776.
The information transmitted by the BRH to the Sao showed that both were electrical energy supplies.
In accordance with Act No 235 / 2004, which applies from 1 January 2005, in the case of electricity supply, the place of performance of the purchaser is the place where the purchaser is legally established, established or established for which the supply takes place.
Consequently, the Czech taxpayers would not have been allowed to indicate electricity supplies in their MZ for 2005.
The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electricity in their MNC as intra-Community supplies resulted in a marginal difference of CZK 503,881,939 in VIES.
Concluding remark
The cooperation achieved the objectives of the BRH and the Sao.
Both Courts gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legislation governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community supplies or acquisitions were identified.
For some of these, it is worth observing.
On the basis of the results of the audit, both Courts prepared recommendations on the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of an audit should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors is the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the field of VAT administration.
