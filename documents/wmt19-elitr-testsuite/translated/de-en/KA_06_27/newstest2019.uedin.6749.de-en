Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasizes that the courts of auditors are authorized to audit the entire public finances.
The declaration requires the courts of auditors to have the power to examine tax collection as broadly as possible.
The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) regards taxes as a significant component of public revenues.
The thematic focus of the Sixth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, a situation may arise where national audit bodies can only carry out their audit activities in cooperation with other national audit bodies.
Examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many countries, may be considered as an example.
Cooperation between authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Court of Auditors auditing in this area must be prepared to work closely together.
The idea of examining VAT and the VIES system arose at the Sixth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating audit bodies first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the analysis of the information available, we selected the subjects for examination planning.
Achieving efficient and effective management of VAT is a longstanding problem and individual States (in particular EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify VAT collection and create greater transparency in this area.
We believe that the results of our audit can not only improve the work of financial management but also provide the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Number: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Exam item:
(CZ) Management of VAT after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
the Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The objective of the investigation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures followed by the financial administration in the field of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with free movement of goods and services and the use of the MIAS1, in particular the control of the application of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The objective of the audit was to examine the intra-Community VAT control system, focusing on mutual assistance in the field of turnover tax in accordance with the above regulations.
The audit should identify weaknesses and make recommendations to address them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (NK) and the Bundesrech-ungshof (BRH) of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business incidents between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared under European guideline 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The period under scrutiny covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two audit bodies.
In addition to the exchange of information priority set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004 of the Commission, other closely related issues have also been examined, such as registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary notifications.
The audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border bus and coach transport and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of sales tax administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for sales tax purposes.
While in Germany traders are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is to exceed the turnover threshold set in the VAT law.
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, for the purposes of turnover tax, the taxable person receives a tax number applicable only to domestic transactions.
If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must ask for a special identification number, the so-called USt IDN.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border bus and coach transport.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border bus and coach transport is exempt from VAT.
In Germany, where the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation under Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover taxes (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic taxable persons have to file VAT returns only for under-year tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany taxable persons have (monthly or quarterly)
Sales tax prior filings and to issue a sales tax annual statement after the end of the calendar year.
Unlike the Czech Republic, taxable persons in Germany must submit their VAT advance declarations electronically.
Introducing the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
Whereas taxable persons in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary notifications to the tax authorities, German taxpayers have to submit summary notifications to CLO2.
Accordingly, in the Czech Republic, the information from the summary notifications is available immediately after their submission.
The information from the summary notifications is only available after their processing by the CLO.
To combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary notifications would shorten the period between the time of sales and the update of VIES data.
This would allow a timely examination of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information on sales tax.
When receiving requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German treasury completed a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information received within the time limit set.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a permanent monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is to develop its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
It should be noted that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful RMS criteria, elements or approaches must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States.
The two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German tax subjects.
Of these, 31 cases were reviewed jointly by using the CLO's legal options where there were doubts about correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the fx used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and reset the sales tax liability of the taxpayers concerned.
In these cases, taxpayers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or failed to identify the purchase of goods in their VAT returns.
In some cases, the fx could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legislation in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused to provide the information requested.
Some cases have been uncovered where taxpayers misrepresented transactions in their summary notifications.
As a result, the data in the VIES were correspondingly flawed, so the clerks (the fx) had to investigate these cases (see 6).
Examining procedures
Examining procedures in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited bodies were: the Ministry of Finance and the 10 fx Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadax, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Txinec.
On 23 April 2007, the College of the NK' approved the findings.
Examination procedure in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the examination area Traffic Taxes and employees of the affiliated Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the 2006 work plan and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a testing phase, the actual testing began in Q4 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKx, the BRH had to announce the examination in several German Länder.
Aside from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the audit was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following fx were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich-Bodies, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nort, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg.
Discussions were also held with the Fx Augsburg city, Aurich, Düsseldorf old town, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The exam results were notified to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
The parallel audit was preceded by several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors.
Participants in these meetings became familiar with the financial administration organization, sales tax legislation and sales tax administration system in each other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the May 2006 meeting.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
This meeting established a timetable for the further procedure and identified the following subjects for parallel examination: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.
2.
Cross-border bus and coach transport - Legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular financial officials' handling of requests for information and verification of selected problem cases mentioned in requests for information and spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on supplies and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. risk management in the sales tax area.
At a meeting to co-ordinate further examination of the NK and BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarised themselves with the examination process in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal seat, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months will be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after exceeding the threshold (section 94(1) of Law No 235/2004 Coll.
The subject must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has passed the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxable person who has exceeded the registration deadline.
A trader with a legal seat, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who provides VAT-related benefits or VAT-exempt benefits with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but fulfils other conditions mentioned in Law No 235/2004.
A trader with a legal seat, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure begins with the receipt of the registration application from the local financial officer in accordance with Law No 337/1992.
Those who wish to voluntarily register for sales tax must specify in their application the cut-off date from which they apply for registration as VAT payers.
The financial officer shall examine the information provided by the trader, i.e. the completed application for registration with all installations.
If he has doubts about the information it contains, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the financial officer has established through verification that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must provide a written notice of registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the notice, the finance officer has to specify the date of entry into force of registration for sales tax and the predisposition period for sales tax.
The predisposition period is the calendar quarter; unless the entrepreneur's sales for the previous calendar year have reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the predisposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose sales reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is eligible to choose calendar month as the predisposition period and has to inform finance officials of this change.
The issuance of a tax code in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The taxable person shall provide the tax code for any communication (including payments) with the tax officer, and in cases where a particular law requires it (e.g. Law No 235/2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents)3.
The tax code contains the coding "CZ" and a basic ingredient in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as a special law determines it.
If the trader has failed to fulfil his obligation despite the financial officer's request to do so, the local financial officer must automatically register him.
A notification of this will also be issued to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business receives a tax number on their first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as VAT payer.
Under Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the duty to register VAT, the financial officer may demand that the taxable person receive up to 10 per cent of the proceeds from the taxable turnover made unlawfully without taxation by the person concerned (from the date on which the trader should have been registered as a taxable person).
The payment of the amount thus determined shall constitute a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98(3) of Law No 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal conditions are met, a VAT payer's registration can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxable person, i.e. mainly on the grounds that the turnover does not meet the registration threshold (section 106(1) of Law No 235/2004).
A taxable person can request the deletion of his registration no earlier than one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) Cancellation of registration on the basis of ex officio (section 106 (7) of Law No 235/2004) if: a) the taxable person failed to perform in the course of 12 consecutive months and failed to inform the tax officer of the reasons why, b) the taxable person failed to fulfil his obligations under Law No 235/2004, c) the previous taxable person no longer fulfilled the conditions for tax liability.
(b) Taxable persons without a legal seat, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State who is not legally established, registered or established in the Czech Republic or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who is not taxable in accordance with section 108 of Law No.
He must apply for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.
It is obliged to indicate in this application all UST-IdNs allocated to it in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, FA Prague 1 must register him retroactively as he became subject to VAT under Law 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic.
In case of retroactive registration, the FA Prague 1 must require the operators concerned to provide proof (invoices or written explanations) of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, FA Prague 1 must require submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, of whom 124 were from Germany.
Under the terms of Section 106 (9) of Law No 235/2004, the financial officer is authorized to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of January 31 of the following- the calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to file tax filings or declarations and pay taxes.
The examination of NK' revealed that if a tax return was made by mail with sending abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the obligatory deadline for filing a tax return, that declaration had not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.
In those cases where these facts relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration become known to the FA later than 31 January, deletion of the non-resident entrepreneur's registration for VAT in the Czech Republic is no longer possible in the calendar year concerned.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
Under the terms of the tax regulation (Section 137, 138 AO), any operation must be notified to the municipality and/or the relevant tax office.
This registration shall take place no later than one month after commencement of business activity.
The municipality passes the registration on to the tax authorities.
If the relevant tax office determines that a business activity has been commenced but has not been notified, it may also register the tax payer on an ex officio basis retroactively.
In Germany, taxable persons, whether resident or non-resident, are obliged to register Zwekke's VAT if they meet the conditions set out in Section 2 of the German Sales Tax Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the level of sales achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special fx is responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.
For example, for entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered and 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs registered as of 1 March 2006.
According to the BRH, these special competences units often refused to register bogus self-employed residents in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
These self-employed workers tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (sham) self-employed do not meet the requirements set out in Section 2 of the UStG for recognition as an entrepreneur, as they are usually dependent on a single client determining their working hours and how they work.
To be registered, the trader must complete a questionnaire of the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a compulsory form for all fx in Germany.
It will be processed either in special organisational units within the fx or in the generally responsible organisational units for tax assessment.
This form will be used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer before a tax code is allocated.
The structure of the tax code for domestic transactions is based on certain specifications:
The first three digits are the number for the relevant FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identifier for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control number.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a UST ID No.
This is allocated by the CLO upon request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The UST IDNr. is automatically allocated by the CLO when the taxable person declares intra-community deliveries in his sales tax prior filings or in his sales tax annual statement.
The UST IDNr. is composed of country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
Entrepreneur's registration may be deleted: 1. on request (e.g. if he ceases to do business), but only after all tax transactions have been completed (all fiscal years have been distributed) or 2.
Typically, the validity of the UST IDN depends on the validity of the sales tax number.
In these cases, the Fx must notify the CLO of the cancellation of the VAT number in order to terminate the validity of the UST IDN at that time.
According to the Sales Tax Act (Section 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxable persons do not have to pay sales tax in the following cases: 1. The previous calendar year's sales plus the resulting sales tax did not exceed the amount of 17,500 and 2. is unlikely to exceed the amount of 50,000.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge other entrepreneurs sales tax, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and make an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of Section 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the sales tax and deduct the pretax.
Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (Section 22A UStG).
This requires them to make exclusively tax-free transactions and to waive the deduction.
The fiscal representative performs the foreign entrepreneur's tax duties, so he does not have to register for sales tax purposes.
The bills state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold mentioned in the VAT law.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, they can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences may arise due to different organizational structures in different states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, a trader who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number only for intra-German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically request the allocation of a USt IDN.
Both NK and BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other member states, such as the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for both national registration for sales tax and intra-Community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) where the taxable person does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows for an accurate predisposition to sales tax for prior predisposition periods, in particular an accurate estimate of sales tax debt.
As the different registration procedures cause problems, rules should be harmonised across the EC.
The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for tax of each natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons residing in Germany for life.
If a natural person enters a business activity, the responsible FA requests a commercial tax identification number that serves as USt IDN.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the UST IDN.
Work to implement an IT procedure for the management of numbers is ongoing.
Cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach
Legislation in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of section 70 of Law No 235/2004, passenger transport between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT since 1 May 2004 and is entitled to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the carriage is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners taxable domestically.
The return journey is regarded as a separate transport operation.
If non-resident traders in the Czech Republic carry out no economic activity other than cross-border bus and coach transport, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as liable for VAT.
Cross-border passenger transport has been exempted from VAT in the Czech Republic under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5(1)(b).
"For the purpose of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28(4) of the Directive is fulfilled or until the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legislation in Germany
Under Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b(1) UStG, a transport service is performed where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport is taxable in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person travels through Germany, the part of the transport in Germany is considered taxable.
Before providing his services in Germany, the non-resident trader must notify the relevant FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each bus named in the taxable person's application.
The entrepreneur shall indicate his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-South.
If the transport is provided for a domestic trader, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the sales tax himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services must pay the turnover tax to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident taxpayer.
In addition to registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means to verify the accuracy of the tax return with respect to taxable passenger transportation:
Customs mobile control groups examine the certificates of foreign-licensed buses used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay sales tax before continuing its journey.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the sales tax paid thus from the tax liability stated in his sales tax return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out in the FA or use the mutual assistance funds referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see No 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the lawfully established turnover tax, the FA may request assistance under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these instruments of mutual assistance in tax matters to verify VAT returns or compliance with tax liability by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the small amount of VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, auditing a non-resident taxpayer's books imposes disproportionately high costs on the taxpayer himself and on financial management.
The latter must examine foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination is likely to take more time than a resident taxpayer, although the examination is limited to passenger transport in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national treasury but also those of the other Member States in so far as he carries out passenger transport operations there.
Furthermore, for each Member State where a single passenger is carried out, the taxable person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the different languages and on the basis of the forms of the tax administrations of the Member States concerned.
Correct taxation of cross-border passenger services creates a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation varies in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic exempts passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the route on German territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer delivers such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the relevant FA beforehand.
This registers the taxable person who must declare the taxable portion of the transport in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with the FA Chemnitz-South have the passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue involved is quite low relative to the administrative burden.
Member States - which levy turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax - have a high administrative burden relative to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state where the carriage begins or where the service provider is based.
Such taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Levy and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise specified by the law, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the trader is required to file a VAT return on the print provided by the Treasury within 25 days of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the end of the deadline for filing the VAT return. Except for this arrangement, according to Law No 235/2004 is the turnover tax on imports of goods.
If a refund claim is made as a result of above-average deductible input taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the deduction being fixed without the need to make an application.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the financial officer initiates a tax procedure regarding the taxpayer's tax liability.
Under Section 73 (11) of Law No 235/2004, the right to deduction may be claimed at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim for deduction was made.
After this period, the deduction can still be applied within three years after the end of the taxation period during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows a supplementary VAT return to be made only for the first time.
A taxable person must make a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, (b) make corrections which do not change the last known tax liability but only change previous information, (c) make corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability under section 49 of Law No 235/2004.
A taxpayer can make a supplemental VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must make the supplemental tax return by the end of the month, which follows the month in which the facts in question were established.
The VAT return can be made electronically either via the Internet or using data media.
The levy by internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without electronic signature, it must be additionally submitted to data media.
The pre-print for the VAT return includes separate lines for indicating the value of intra-community supplies and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the sales tax return.
Some headings are used for automated primary checks under the ATIS system.
The value of goods supplied to persons registered as taxable in other EC Member States is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary notifications.
The value of buying goods from other Member States registered as taxable persons is compared with the information in the summary declarations of taxable persons from other EC Member States.
Under the ATIS system, the FA conducts a credibility audit of sales tax returns.
This is automatic as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior audit.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the benchmarks for credibility and an assessment of the risks of the sales tax returns.
Under Section 37(1) of Law No 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to fulfil their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or decision under that law.
Automated Tax Information System, used by Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its examination, the Nkx found that Fx rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person in question if the VAT return was not made.
Levy and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly sales tax prior filings and annual sales tax returns.
Those taxpayers required to submit sales tax prior filings must still file an annual sales tax return.
Even small business owners not required to pay sales tax must file an annual sales tax return.
Taxpayers are required in principle to file a sales tax pre-registration until the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which sales tax is incurred (Section 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT debt exceeds 6,136 in the previous year or is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is required to file monthly VAT filings no later than 10 days after the end of the relevant month.
The taxable person may also choose to levy monthly sales tax prior filings if they have been reimbursed an amount in excess of 6,136 in the previous year (Section 18 (2A) UStG).
If the annual sales tax is no more than 512 percent, neither sales tax prior filings nor sales tax returns shall be made.
A resulting sales tax debt is payable 10 days after the tax period ends.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the Treasury.
(Legal) deadlines for processing sales tax returns and for refunding sales tax overpayments do not exist.
To receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
Basically, sales tax returns, including refund cases, must be processed expeditiously.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (tax and payment) deadlines (Section 18 (6) UStG).
The time extension must be requested separately.
If it is granted, VAT pre-notifications and payments may be made one month later.
This payment is offset against the sales tax debt established for the pre-notification period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must make a corrected VAT advance.
There is no "supplemental" sales tax return.
Once filed with the tax office by May 31 of the following year, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect sales tax prior filing, but only the incorrect annual sales tax return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was made.
After this four-year period ends, a sales tax return can usually only be corrected in cases of frivolous tax reduction or evasion.
Taxable persons must submit their VAT advance declarations electronically.
The fx can grant exceptions to this rule to avoid undue hardship.
The annual sales tax return can be made both in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the taxpayer must make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT prior filings or declarations are made, the Treasury is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxable person's turnover6.
In the case of late levy, the taxpayer can be subject to a late surcharge (up to 10 per cent of the tax liability or up to 25,000 euros).
During an earlier audit, the BRH found that the Fx often failed to collect this late surcharge.
In those cases where the Fx levied the late surcharges, the amount was set inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average arrears, particularly when filing the annual sales tax return.
The pre-printing of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the reference of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be indicated in a separate line of the sales tax return.
Sales tax returns filed on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data electronically filed tax returns are immediately available to the Treasury Department.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is collected electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and are selected according to specific criteria.
The VAT returns thus selected must be verified by the competent clerk on the basis of the automatically produced test notes (see 5.2).
Although the Treasury only has to make a rough estimate of the sales tax debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the taxation period.
Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or calendar month.
In Germany, taxable persons must submit their advance declarations no later than 10 days after the end of either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The VAT annual statement must be made no later than May 31 of the following year.
The duty to make an annual VAT return has some pros and cons:
- After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer may correct the errors in the monthly prior filings by filing a single VAT return;
- If the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period;
- The Länder do not provide the same VIES data on intra-Community purchases by German taxpayers until the VAT annual declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This duty enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the relevant FA may reconcile the sales tax annual statement with the corresponding statements for the direct taxes and with the financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only verify the amount of sales on the basis of income tax returns.
Unlike the current rules in the Czech Republic, German taxable persons are obliged to submit their VAT pre-notification electronically.
The introduction of an electronic tax return obligation in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary messages
Handling of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of section 102 of Law No 235/2004, a trader supplying goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State shall make summary notifications (hereinafter "ZM").
The value of the goods delivered is always denominated in Czech currency in the ZM, broken down by UST-IdNr7, the individual taxable person under whom they are registered in the other Member State.
Details of services are not provided in the ZM.
Taxable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must surrender the ZM to the local FA no later than 25 days after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the error being detected.
Faulty data in the ZM are always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, taxpayers can also make the ZM electronically.
If a taxable person does not surrender ZM or correction ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No 235/2004, the financial officer must ask him to surrender the relevant ZM, pointing out the consequences of non-levy.
In its audit, the Nkx found that Fx mostly did not use its power to impose fines on its delinquent taxpayers.
In particular, taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations when they fail to pay a tax.
Under Section 102 (5) of Law No 235/2004, the financial officer is required to verify the information in the ZM or correction ZM, remove any ambiguities and use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of non-matching
8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxpayer corrects false information in the ZM by providing a correction ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The tax officer must correct the data on goods delivered to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by providing a correction ZM;
the financial officer has demonstrated the impropriety of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Corrections entered by the Financial Officer, without any correction ZM from the taxable person, do not replace the obligation of the taxable person to make a correction ZM, but only result in the correction of data in the VIES so that it is up-to-date, complete and accurate.
Data from the SDGs will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of turnover tax may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance).
It contains all incorrect UST IDNs indicated in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect UST IDNs are used in some of the transmitted lines of ZM or corrected ZM, an entry is made to the list of false UST IDNs.
The list includes a "Notification of Doubt concerning USt-IdNr."
The finance officer reviews the data and enters the outcome of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must indicate this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the relevant lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and those of the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The faculty there must investigate the deviations.
Three different situations can then arise:
a) The value given by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of its VAT return is lower than the value of deliveries given by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the finance officer checks the accuracy of the claims.
(b) The difference is zero.
This situation may arise either through a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or through a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer meanwhile submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to nonetheless verify the accuracy of the information in the sales tax return.
c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return is higher than the value of his supplies reported by suppliers of other EC Member States.
Again, it is the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the finance officer enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination is shown in Graph 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance) for each quarter of 2005.
Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO decreased for each quarter of 2005.
The substantial reduction in the number in Q4 2005 is partly due to the Czech CLO raising the threshold for case selection to other EC Member States, taking into account the minimum threshold for requesting information.
Differences between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic acquirer.
There may also be an error by the taxable person in another Member State or an error caused by the different indication of certain types of deliveries in each EC Member State.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited fx are shown in table 1.
Handling and delivery of summary notifications in Germany
Traders making intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participating in triangular operations are required to make quarterly ZMs listing intra-Community deliveries by purchaser (Section 18a (1) UStG).
ZM must be issued no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter.
If a permanent extension is granted for the filing of sales tax prior filings, this also applies to ZM.
The ZM are to be surrendered at the CLO.
Since January 1, 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.
The responsible FA can allow exemptions for individual taxpayers to avoid undue hardship.
If the taxpayer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is required to make a correction ZM within one month.
If ZM is not surrendered, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat of a penalty payment and - setting the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows the imposition of a penalty payment of up to EUR 25,000 (Section 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of EUR 125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, Section 26a (1) No 5 UStG stipulates that the taxable person acts unlawfully if he intentionally or recklessly renders a ZM incorrectly, not fully or not in time, or if he fails to correct a ZM or not in time.
This infringement can be punishable by a fine of up to 5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the fx because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.
ZM's data is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary notifications will only be available to fx after it has been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
ZM's data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter concerned (in VIES).
In the case of incorrect UST IDNs in the ZM of German taxpayers, the German CLO receives a notification "O'MCTL" from the other Member State.
As a result, the CLO turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be made to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the UST IDN at the request of the CLO.
However, remembering and threatening and setting up to three consecutive fines takes too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases that were ultimately reported to the relevant fx were usually completed within one to two monas.
The relevant FA refused the exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73 percent of these cases9.
If the taxpayer provided the correct UST IDN, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FA cannot correct the VIES data itself.
The BRH found that neither the Fx nor the CLO controlled the levy of the corrected ZM.
As the CLO does not have access to the data on VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information provided in the VAT Preliminary Notifications or the VAT Returns with the relevant information in the ZM before this data is sent to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the fx, usually during the preparation of a special VAT review.
Data received from other Member States is processed at the CLO.
Incorrect UST IDNs are detected and reported to affected Member States.
The data will be used to control employment taxation in the fx.
Once available in the system, it balances the CLO with data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be drawn up and sent to the relevant fx.
This happens on an ongoing basis, whereas a listing of the acquisition data of all sales tax payers is later compiled and forwarded to the fx.
The Risk Management System (RMS) for the predisposition process then equates these data with those on intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community supplies to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The fx edit the ZM and forward the data to the clo.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by taxable persons in ZM are compared with intra-Community deliveries reported by the same taxable persons.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the tax setting process.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to make quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, taxable persons must submit ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available after processing by the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, taxable persons in the ZM only specify the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the zm. Unlike the Czech fx, the German fx cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the given zm itself.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect UST IDNs were not corrected even when the taxpayer notified the FA of the correct UST IDN.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community supplies provided by German taxable persons in their VAT advance declarations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between pre-notification and ZM data are not regularly detected before the German CLO transmits MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted VIES data.
Data provided by other Member States on supplies of goods to Czech taxable persons are compared in the Czech Republic with data on purchases of goods reported by Czech taxable persons in their VAT declarations.
The Czech CLO takes the balance separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations are sent for examination to the fx.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control is only carried out on taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
Furthermore, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons only if the RMS has produced an audit document or the taxpayer has been selected for an audit anyway.
This procedure exonerates the fx from clarifying the reasons for differences occurring.
On the other hand, detecting VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
To combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of SDGs, especially VIES, provides fiscal authorities with information that may well be six months old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to hand over monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would add only marginally to the red tape, since most taxable persons in the Czech Republic and Germany are already required to file monthly VAT returns or advance declarations, and ZM does not require more information than for the VAT returns or pre-notifications.
To avoid red tape, ZM's levy could be linked to the filing of VAT returns or advance filings.
However, an obligation to pay ZM monthly would create more periodic discrepancies between data on intra-Community deliveries and on intra-Community purchases and increase data flows between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed because of the concerns of the federal states.
These feared that a monthly transfer of VIES data to the CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to levy ZM monthly to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level so that MIAS data can be updated monthly.
Statistical information on shipments of goods and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of false tax numbers, or UST IDNs, in the O-MCTL notifications exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
This data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different basis for calculating the number of O'MCTL notifications.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which ZM was made, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which OxMCTL reported.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information.
International exchange of information on request is carried out through a request for information (see: request for information RFI) using standardised SCAC printing.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFIs or their replies to a preserved RFI by the CLO.
The CLO also receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany were audited by the NK.
Out of a total of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5 per cent) were dealt with within the three-month period.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NK. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to requests made by Germany can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 requests (i.e. 40.6 per cent) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4 per cent) were dealt with after the expiry of this deadline and in 19 cases Germany had not yet been able to reply to the NK's examination.
For more details on the deadlines for responding to requests for information from the Czech Republic, please see Graph 3.
The percentages of intra-Community sales indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information have mostly been in excess of 60,000 euros.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information that is important for determining VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between Member States is electronic.
Automatic exchange as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means systematic transmission of pre-defined information to other Member States at regular intervals without prior request.
Structured automatic exchange means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information is available.
The Czech Republic will automatically inform the other Member States about deliveries of new vehicles.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the pre-printing notification of the delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to section 19 of Law No 235/2004 and from the copy of the issued invoice.
In processing this form, the financial officer will enter the required data into the relevant document template and forward it directly to the relevant employee of the Finance Directorate, where this data will be collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which it will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic is also providing information to other Member States on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and on potential missing traders.
This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC format in spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local FA.
The fx e-mail the completed SCAC 2004 print directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC preprints to the foreign CLO.
The fx are instructed to record their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACprint used is single-spray.
Half of the German requests for information examined by BRH were sent to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State or to prove the tax freedom of intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall verify whether the value of the consignments referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount of 15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum threshold.
Furthermore, the German CLO is concerned about the translation of freely worded texts in the SCAC formulation "(B1-17) or (E)".
To reply to the request for information, the CLO directs it to the relevant FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines are set at the various levels of German financial management.
While the German CLO has the technical means to monitor timekeeping, it does not have the necessary manpower to remind the Fx to respond to unfinished requests for information.
The fx receive the required information through the taxpayer's letter or carrying out an external audit.
External auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special VAT examination covering all taxable transactions over a period of several months or the so-called sales tax review, which may only relate to a recent transaction.
This short and flexible form of audit does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proved effective in investigating a single transaction.
In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany transmits to the other Member State the following information: - on USt-IdNr. allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of VAT to traders established in other EC Member States.
Germany has also committed to provide the other EC Member States with the following information in the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. The supply of new vehicles to traders without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (distribution) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between purchases reported by a taxable person and MIAS data submitted by other Member States, i.e.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information and/or spontaneous information is done both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities responsible for sending the relevant SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC (Czech-English) prints and translates information provided into English and German respectively, the German fx follow the instruction to make requests for information or spontaneous information in a one-language form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NK' found that the Czech treasury handled 74.5 per cent of requests received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany by the German treasury were only completed in 40.6 per cent of cases within that period.
While the German CLO points out the fx to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the absence of memories, there is a high proportion of refreshed requests for information.
This is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices to respond to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several entities at different levels of financial administration are involved in the management of VAT risk.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of VAT or its Risk Management Unit is engaged in identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluating trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion of "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the VIES data to detect possible tax evasion in intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates risky products, prepares the VAT risk management conceptually and cooperates with the relevant EC institutions and other Member States.
The Department of International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT provides information exchange, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system, provides publicity and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank

Among other things, the Department of Methodology of Tax Audit and Tax Tracking conducts risk analyses as part of the methodological governance of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, creates risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration as well as other sources, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation bodies exist at the financial directorates. Among their tasks is the search for taxable persons and industries that are at risk in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxpayers (e.g. in the Internet services, job placement, electronic and print media sectors, etc.)
Special audit units have been set up in 12 selected fx.
They have regional competence and, by appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local area of responsibility.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in identified new and "enhanced" forms of tax evasion, particularly in relation to chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the riskiness of tax declarations, - the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited", whereby the taxable persons are selected on the basis of certain criteria;
The task of "MIAS" allows, inter alia: "Review of the validity of the UST-IdNr from taxable persons from other Member States, "Confirmation of the value of the goods supplied to a Czech taxable person in the ZM from the other Member States which have not provided the taxable persons in their respective Member States"
As part of their mission to fight tax evasion, finance officials have access to the data from government agencies such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, business registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1
Risk management in Germany
In the Federal Republic of Germany, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 Länder are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor federal fiscal administrations have a complete set of data.
At CLO level, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter "KUSS") collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, the KUSS has set up another database called ZAUBER.
The KUSS coordinates both related national VAT fraud cases and cross-border VAT fraud cases.
The KUSS experience is brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, professionals from several other CLO and BMF organizing units are also involved.
Formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. of other Member States appearing in the ZM of German taxpayers will be conducted at the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of MIAS data and its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the UST IDNs referred to in the SDGs will be assessed on the basis of the O-MCTL indications submitted by the other Member States (on the procedure for correcting invalid UST IDNs, see also 4.4.2).
Furthermore, the CLO's RMS is based on MIAS data provided by other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the discovery of suspected missing traders.
The Federal Government is required to process these communications and to forward the results of its investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH's audit confirmed that all available features must be included to be sufficiently likely to conclude a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH advised the BMF to work with combinations of different clues when creating the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other evidence such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour, the industry or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists at federal tax administrations and focuses on processing sales tax advance filings and annual declarations.
For example, the system establishes a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT advance declaration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete delivery of the ZM.
Furthermore, this type of risk management compares the purchases made by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return with the data in the VIES.
Federal tax administrations avoid comparing quarterly data as it would reveal too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or fraud; e.g.:
- Suppliers and purchasers assume different times for the execution of intra-Community sales;
different accounting and tax declaration of Skonti and rebates.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the VAT returns and certain other references (e.g. company wording, age of the owner/shareholder, number of employees and payment of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has established a rules-based risk management system that allows a team of anti-fraud specialists (hereinafter risk managers) to program their own rules to filter out suspected tax cheats.
This system is used in the processing of sales tax filings by the Fx.
This will give the relevant FA the advice of the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Because this system is not capable of learning, risk managers have to adjust the rules according to feedback from the fx.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected retraction cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the features for tax evasion.
The system creates a list of tax cases each month where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent fiscal authorities will decide on the assessment of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, tax auditors must report their findings so the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Backed by lots of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro fuzzy system (also called the datamining system) calculates how likely a taxpayer is to be caught up in tax fraud.
After that, it creates a monthly list of alleged tax cheats.
As a result of this list, the Fx select the taxable persons in question for audit and report the audit results to the data center in question.
The introduction of these three RMSs is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems appropriate.
Whether the hoped-for effects will materialize upon actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although the present report does not address the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech and German Republics, it has found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud, in particular carousel fraud, has proved not to be a national problem but a European one.
Those involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State but in several.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State.
Tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State where the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
There should therefore be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel audits, the NK and BRH examined the quality and recoverability of information on selected deliveries and/or
Acquisitions which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the handling of several deliveries about which there were doubts, or which the taxpayers of both states stated differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, NK' examined a total of eight business incidents between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, based on notifications by the BRH, the NKO examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany indicated by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the German tax authorities, BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems identified in Chapter 4:1.
1.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 60,500 percent from a German taxpayer.
When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only 29,869, the Czech authorities sent a request for information to Germany to verify the value of the goods delivered.
The German side stated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German taxable person had supplied to his Czech counterpart goods valued at 27,381 in the second quarter of 2004, 31,997 in the third quarter and 10,276 in the fourth quarter.
Furthermore, it emerged from the reply that the USt-IdNr of the German taxpayer was only valid as of 28 September 2004, but the German CLO had granted another request by the German taxpayer and retroactively moved the validity of the USt-IdNr to 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was an (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
In 2004, through a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NK' found that the Czech taxable person had made supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods during which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of VAT from purchases from the other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent clerk of the Czech Finance Office could not clearly determine whether the declared purchases included the value of supplies from the above German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKx, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as liable for VAT in September 2003.
However, on registration he did not apply for the allocation of a USt IDN, but only a tax number applicable to Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively allocate a UST IDN to a taxable person, in 2006 the responsible clerk of the German financial administration did so retroactively as of May 1, 2004.
The German CLO retroactively allocates a USt IDN if the German SHE entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer applied for a UST IDN.
In this case, the CLO retroactively grants the USt IDN because the entrepreneur does not require a valid UST IDN under Section 6 UStG for intra-Community delivery.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need its supplier's (valid) USt IDN to explain the intra-Community acquisition.
Due to these procedural differences between Member States, the German CLO granted the USt-IdNr. retroactive in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for the review of the German entrepreneur's VAT registration.
The VIES data is the registration date of 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
The German authorities replied that the German taxable person had been registered on 1 October 2004, but was not allocated a USt IDN in Germany until 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons.
By enquiring the Czech local financial official, the bank learned that the financial official had carried out a VAT audit with the Czech taxpayer for the taxation periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
In that examination, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 that he had provided to the German taxpayer prior to its VAT registration (i.e. before October 1, 2004).
The (Czech) tax office imposed a tax debt of 1,880 CZK on the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the request of the German taxable person, BRH found that the UST-IdNr. had only been allocated to the German taxpayer when he registered his company with the FA on 16 February 2005.
The FA also registered him retroactively as of October 1, 200415 for sales tax purposes to monitor the 2004 sales tax return.
In this VAT return, the taxable person indicated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160 percent (approximately CZK 5,000).
3. In its VAT return for September 2004 and in its ZM for the third quarter 2004, a Czech taxpayer indicated deliveries of goods worth 114,615 CZK to a German taxpayer.
When verifying the registration of the German taxpayer in the system MIAS, the Czech financial official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after shipments of goods to Germany.
The Czech taxpayer issued a supplemental VAT return explaining revenues from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
In a question with the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NK' found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted a request for a resumption of the taxation procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return, confirming that the German taxable person had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech financial official verified the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer as part of the international exchange of information.
According to the German information, the German taxpayer was not allocated a UST IDN until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery.
As a result, the Czech financial official dismissed the request to resume the taxation process.
BRH found that no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place in this case because the German taxable person had only received a UST IDN on 11 November 2004.
However, the German receiver declared both the acquisition as intra-Community acquisition and the turnover tax thereon, and also demanded reimbursement of input taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not result in a change in the amount of tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German finance official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
The BRH also found that the German taxpayer's company referred to in the request for information was changed while the reply was being processed in Germany, leading to confusion between two German taxpayers.
This name change in the German taxpayer also confused the Czech finance official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German finance official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxable person from a German taxable person worth 22,686.
Through a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the Czech financial official had examined with the Czech taxpayer during an external audit whether the intra-community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had booked and paid the bill for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-community acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier stated in the invoice not his USt IDNR but only his tax number intended for business within Germany.
According to the VIES data, the German taxable person is only registered for VAT related to intra-Community transactions from 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech financial official also requested that the German treasury should send a copy of the German taxpayer's registration certificate so that he could initiate an appropriate tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a turnover tax for the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law a taxable person supplying goods to other Member States does not have to have UST IDNs for intra-Community deliveries to claim the VAT exemption for such delivery.
The supplier must have only the purchaser's UStIdN in the other Member State and be able to show that the goods are transported to the other Member State.
In this case the turnover under German tax law is a (tax exempt) intra-Community supply which should be subject to employment taxation in the Czech Republic.
Importantly, the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the German supplier's core business.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community sales if they are below the minimum amount limit of 15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech taxpayer purchased from a German taxpayer goods worth 12,561 percent.
The Czech financial official carried out an audit for this taxation period.
In the context of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech authorities requested verification of this shipment by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he had not received the goods, had never been in business contact with the German company and that the purchase of the goods had not been recorded.
The German tax administration rejected the request for the transmission of receipts - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - on the grounds that the turnover was below 15,000, and no other justification was given.
As the Czech financial officer did not receive any documents for retrospective taxation of the acquired goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax fixing had persisted.
Following a request from the NK, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative17" (Section 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to a tax exemption was recognised.
As a result of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send to the Czech Republic the documents required for the retrospective taxation of the purchased goods.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the German Financial Administration's responses to requests for information exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the Czech Financial Administration's responses:
6. In its assessment, the Czech authorities found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech authorities had sent a request for information on the value of WA supplies to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person had notified a consignment of goods to the Czech taxable person for a value of 86,307, but the Czech taxable person declared only the purchase of goods for the same period.
In response to the request for information sent to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side indicated that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech finance official requested, by means of an SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
It found that at the time of its examination a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.
Through a request to the local finance official, the NK' found that the Czech taxpayer had not declared in his VAT return the supply of new motor vehicles to this German taxpayer worth 11,816,103 CZK.
The Czech financial official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA.
Following the BRH's notification, a special VAT check was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany, finding that the purchase of all the cars in question had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold on to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. According to the VIES data, in the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer purchased a car from a German taxable person worth 48,500 euros.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By enquiring the local financial official in the Czech Republic, the NK' found that the Czech taxpayer had not returned VAT since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not file tax returns even after being requested by the financial official.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the aforementioned shipment from the German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the financial official, he sent a request for information on the above delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in international exchange until the completion of the examination of the NK.
Due to non-compliance with obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the Czech taxable person's VAT registration was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases only a partial reply was sent because at the time of the NK and BRH examination the competent FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, by means of an SCAC printing, the Czech financial officer requested verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German finance official indicated that he only had invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth 16,335.
On the basis of the NK's request, BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed with the purchaser in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth 16,335 x double in its VAT prior filings for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech finance official requested, by means of an SCAC formulation, a review of the supply of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with signs of carousel fraud.
The German authorities sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic confirming that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
It found that the local FA had carried out several external checks on the Czech taxpayer to verify the deduction above average.
However, an unauthorised claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German taxable person had declared the purchase of goods from other Member States for the period in question in his VAT returns at a total value of 579,114.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for disagreement between the declaration of intra-community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the disclosures in the supplier's ZM.
The cases examined showed that periodic inconsistencies in keiten18 or incorrect declaration of a turnover as intra-Community goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth 35,716 percent from the German taxpayer, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare this purchase.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the financial official and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech financial official asked for a review of how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech as part of the international exchange of information.
The German reply to the request for information showed that according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the given address and the goods were collected by an agreed haulier.
The total value of the order was 155,000 euros, but the German taxpayer only supplied goods worth 21,659 percent.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer a false confirmation of payment in favour of the German taxpayer of 155,153.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech clients, was able to recover the material supplied, with the exception of a portion worth 7,916.
In a question with the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NK' found that on the basis of the information received, the financial administration subsequently imposed turnover tax on supplies of goods from other Member States amounting to CZK 388,522.
Following a request from the NK' , BRH confirmed that, after corrections, the German supplier had reported only one shipment of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth 7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the reversal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested verification of a shipment of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question the Czech taxable person supplied goods worth 396,126 to the German taxable person and supplied services worth 11,885.
It found that the Czech authorities had carried out an audit of the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate this shipment.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and assembled a production plant.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of order after 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer did not take the mounted production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German production plant 107,100 and 11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the calculations but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
By enquiring the local financial official in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that all invoices on the Czech taxpayer's books had been properly recorded.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply of the Czech financial administration, the locally responsible FA concluded that these transactions constituted a uniform (goods) supply by the Czech taxpayer to the German, including assembly.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is where the production plant is assembled.
The German beneficiary of the factory delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German VAT law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim an input tax deduction of the same amount.
As the German taxpayer's VAT debt remained unchanged, the German FA did not induce a correction of VAT returns.
13. According to the VIES data, in February 2005 the Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine worth 58,000 euros from the German taxpayer C.
The Czech financial official addressed a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that German taxpayer C had supplied this machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but returned it to German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany but to the establishment of German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information further revealed that the German taxpayer C had supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the seat of the German taxpayer's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this shipment (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community supply of goods.
By enquiring the local financial officer responsible for the taxable B, the NK' found that, according to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004 the German taxpayer C had supplied goods (another machine) to the Czech taxpayer worth 88,027.
Taxman B explained that he had not received these goods, so the local Czech financial official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer to that was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations into the taxable person B, the financial officer found that the machine had not been registered with the taxable person B for 88,027, which could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German taxpayer C supplied to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
It also found that the Czech local financial officer responsible for the taxable person A had carried out an audit.
The Finance Officer had the invoice of the German taxpayer C dated 7 February 2005, in which the taxable person A is specified as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech financial official found that the taxpayer A had not accounted for this invoice.
Taxpayer A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005, and also worried about transportation.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxpayer A.
The BRH found that German taxpayer C supplied the 88,027 percent machine not to the Czech Republic but to another German taxpayer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German finance official did not recognise the German taxable C's claim for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
German taxpayer D supplied the machine to Czech taxpayer B.
Under German law this shipment was not subject to tax in Germany but subject to turnover tax in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that the German taxable person C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the supply of a machine valued at 58,000 EUR to the Czech taxpayer A.
This delivery was not verified in the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below represents the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NK' found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German finance official requested verification of intra-Community supplies of a German taxpayer worth 879,680,625 percent to a Czech taxpayer.
The German finance official said there were suspicions that this was a fictitious intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German taxpayer has not been active since 1999.
It found that the Czech financial official had carried out an external audit of the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim made by the German taxpayer against the German financial administration by the Czech taxpayer as a shareholder in the German company the German FA.
According to the information provided to the bank, the Czech financial official does not yet have any information that the German authorities are handling the case with regard to the Czech taxpayer.
The information available indicates that this was not a shipment of goods, but the amount in question is still stored in the VIES as intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate intra-Community acquisitions in beneficiaries' tax returns (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer supplied a Czech taxpayer with a total value of 33,205.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and collected the remaining goods personally.
By requesting the locally competent Czech fiance officer, the NK' found that the Czech taxable person had made a supplementary VAT return for the relevant period before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, differences in the value of the acquisition could not be resolved and the Czech financial official recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxpayer.
This examination has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer worth 46,854.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community purchases of goods worth only 14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
The German reply to this request sent three invoices representing a total value of the goods delivered of 31.999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the VIES data.
By requesting the local Czech financial official, the NK' found that after receiving the reply from Germany, he approached the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and stayed with her in such a way that, after reviewing the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about filing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
No supplemental sales tax return has been made until now.
The Czech finance official informed the NKx that he would proceed in such a way as to respect the deadlines for retroactive VAT setting for the relevant tax period.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxable person delivered goods to the German taxable person for a value of EUR 11,600.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German finance official asked for verification as to whether the aforementioned Czech taxpayer actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had set up a number of bogus companies in Germany.
Following the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
However, according to the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not supplied by Germany to the Czech Republic but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer provided evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as liable for VAT in Germany and was not taxed in either the Czech Republic or Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech financial official provided this information in his reply to the request for information to the German financial administration.
By enquiring the local Czech financial official, the NK' found that the Czech taxable person had made a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 based on a tax audit, declaring, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German taxpayer while asserting the right to deduct VAT on purchases from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not file a sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
Based on a supplemental VAT return that had been made after the external audit, the Czech financial official set the sales tax debt unchanged.
Under Czech legislation, in this case there was no purchase of goods from other Member States as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech financial officer drew a wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information indicating that the goods had not left Germany, the German financial official corrected the German taxpayer's tax return and demanded the payment of sales tax worth EUR 1,600.
Furthermore, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been made:
18.
The Czech financial official received a request for information from the German treasury on whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a 47.400 percent car from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied as an installation by a print of the Czech taxpayer's VAT registration certificate.
As another facility, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial official found that the passport was stolen, that the person named in it had not introduced a vehicle to the Czech Republic and indicated she had no contacts with a German taxpayer.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech finance official answered the request for information while stating that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car.
By enquiring the Czech local financial official, the NK' found that the Czech taxpayer was not located at the address given in the commercial register and that the company's managing director could not be reached.
Following a tax appeal procedure for the taxation period February 2005, the Czech financial official set the Czech taxpayer's tax liability at zero.
In the course of another investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it based on an Internet ad.
The BRH found that the local German financial official had refused the German taxpayer's right to exemption from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference between the value of the goods purchased and reported values from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the VIES data, the German financial official requested verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech financial official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the Czech company's shareholder.
The Czech taxpayer filed a VAT return and a ZM which had been signed by a person not authorised to do so, namely that shareholder of the company, following the deletion of the manager in the commercial register.
The Czech taxpayer's accountant told the financial official that the capital owner had paid the payment received in euros into the company's account for the invoiced goods.
Cash receipts were not put out.
By requesting the local Czech FA, the NK' found that the financial officer recognised the Czech taxpayer's claim for VAT exemption for shipments of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
BRH found that the German finance official did not correct the German acquirer's VAT return as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the German taxpayer's insolvency.
Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually collecting a fixed VAT debt.
20. According to the VIES data, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth 4,251,196 in 2005, according to which he had purchased goods worth 43,274.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition either in its 2004 VAT return or in the for 2005.
He also did not declare corresponding initial sales in value terms.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community shipments of goods with a total value of CZK 167.246.083.
The request for information was received on 6 September 2006, in which the German side asked to verify whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request, the Czech authorities stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
The documents provided to the NK' by the competent financial official show that a protocol had been drawn up on 30 March 2006, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, on the start of the audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005.
The taxman was simultaneously asked by the financial officer to provide all accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the trade register, the single managing director's term expired on May 16, 2005, with no new managing director appointed.
The Czech taxpayer has not issued any sales tax returns since April 2006.
In the context of the parallel investigation, the NKx, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR) not established in Germany informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intended to conduct taxable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the Company was registered as of June 2005 but did not receive a German UST ID No.
The (UCR) accepted a contract from a Danish company (UDK) to produce wind turbines and deliver them to Austria on behalf of, at risk and for the invoice of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient manufacturing capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German taxpayer (UDE) established in Germany.
The following figure represents the contractual relationships and transportation route of the wind turbines:
Under German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own bill for assembly.
Because of the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is taxable in Austria.
Because the carrier was contracted by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had to carry out the transport on its own behalf, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were supplied to another EC Member State (AU) and the receiver is registered as taxable in one EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) because the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is a different one from the Czech company's home state19.
Accordingly, the se delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
The other wind turbines produced in Germany were supplied in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM made to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
It found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the NK' and BRH examined case designs to show the size of differences caused by the different 2004 legislation between claims in sales tax returns and VIES data.
The audited cases also show that it takes some time for taxpayers and the Fx to apply the new legal regulations:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxpayer reported deliveries of goods totalling CZK 792,977,452 to a German taxpayer.
During the same period another Czech taxpayer in his ZM notified intra-Community deliveries to another German taxpayer with a total value of 18.157.265 CZK.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKx showed that both were power supplies.
Both Czech taxable persons took into account the above deliveries in their ZM under Czech Law No 235/2004, applicable in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of NK' found that the Czech Republic and Germany had different legal requirements for the supply and purchase of electrical energy in 2004.
Whereas in the Czech Republic taxable persons declared supplies of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 applicable in 2004, the German legislation applicable in 2004 did not constitute intra-Community purchases of goods but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
Differences in legislation were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxpayer in its ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 provided intra-Community deliveries to a German taxpayer with a total value of 240.411.163 CZK and another Czech taxpayer in its ZM for the same period of intra-Community deliveries.
Information provided by the BRH to the NK' revealed that both were deliveries of electrical power.
According to the wording of Law No 235/2004, applicable from 1 January 2005, in the case of the supply of electrical energy, the place of fulfilment shall be the place where the purchaser has his legal seat, place of business or place of establishment for which that supply takes place.
Therefore the Czech taxable persons should not have specified the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electricity in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Conclusion
The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NK.
Both courts gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing VAT administration.
Interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions emerged during the parallel tests.
With some of these, another observation is worth watching.
Based on the audit results, both auditors produced recommendations on managing the sales tax.
The follow-up to these recommendations in the form of a control audit should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two courts are the basis for successful future audits in the area of VAT administration.
