Report on the results of the parallel review of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasizes that the courts of auditors are entitled to examine the entire public finances.
The declaration requires the courts of auditors to have the power to scrutinise the tax collection as much as possible.
The Organization of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the auditing of public revenues by the courts of auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit work of the Court of Auditors is to develop a specific strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is particularly true of taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As the national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which the national auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the auditors of other States.
The test of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant losses of income in many countries, can be considered as an example.
Cooperation between the authorities is required in the fight against such crimes.
Auditing bodies in this area must be prepared to work closely together.
The idea of auditing the turnover tax and the MIAS system came up at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating courts had to first familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Based on the analysis of the available information, we selected the subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving effective and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem, and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only improve the work of the financial administration, but also provide the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel review of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of sales tax after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
(De) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the examination in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the area of turnover tax, following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the application of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(De) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006 by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NK") and the Federal Court of Justice ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the utilization of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of the turnover tax management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the tests was prepared within the meaning of European guideline 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI test standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and the Commission in 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of tax collectors, tax returns and summary reports.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by buses and the comparison of statistics.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
Whereas in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is exceeding the VAT threshold set by the VAT law.
In the Czech Republic, tax collectors receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax collector receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German tax collector wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As there are problems with the different registration procedures, the rules should be standardised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus.
In the Czech Republic, the cross-border carriage of passengers by buses is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, if the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax.
Efforts should be made at the EC level to standardise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, tax collectors only have to file VAT returns for periods of under-age taxation (month or quarter), tax collectors in Germany have tax returns (monthly or quarterly).
Pre-registration of sales tax and after the end of the calendar year a declaration of the annual turnover tax.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax collectors in Germany are required to submit pre-tax VAT declarations by electronic means.
The introduction of the electronic tax declaration system in the Czech Republic would improve the effectiveness of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While tax collectors in the Czech Republic are required to submit their Comprehensive Reports to the tax authorities, German tax collectors are required to submit the Comprehensive Reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the Comprehensive Notices will be available immediately after filing them in the Czech Republic.
The information from the Comprehensive Notices will only be available to German consumers after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is required as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of turnover and the update of MIAS data.
This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of sales tax.
For incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO will monitor compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the prescribed period.
Due to these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a continuous monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NCA and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions, which were carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly investigated using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the tax authorities made use of the information obtained during the international exchange of information and re-established the value added tax liability of the persons concerned.
In these cases, the tax collectors had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or not declared the purchase of goods in their VAT declaration.
In some cases, people could not use the information obtained during the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide information.
Some cases have been uncovered in which tax collectors have shown inaccurate sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in MIAS were correspondingly erroneous, so that the clerks (the case manager) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Testing in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the regional audit departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 departments Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NCP approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 in the field of traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a trial phase, the actual testing started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NK, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the test was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following cases have been included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Aug.
In addition, discussions were held with the City of Augsburg, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results were reported to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two courts
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held between representatives of both audit bodies.
The participants in these meetings became familiar with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of the VAT administration in each other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for further proceedings was drawn up and the following examination topics for parallel examinations were determined: 1.
Registration of tax collectors.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of the financial officers in the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problems mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the area of sales tax.
At a meeting in December 2006 to coordinate the further examination of the NK and BRH, both sides familiarised themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests that have already been achieved.

An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1 000 000, will be paid on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has crossed the threshold (Section 94 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Law No. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he / she has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of tax collectors if they have exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides services exempt from VAT or VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements mentioned in Law No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, can voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
The registration procedure according to Law No. 337 / 1992 begins with the receipt of the application from the local financial officer responsible for registration.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must specify in your application the date on which you apply for registration as a VAT collector.
The financial officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information given in it, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
If, by verification, the financial officer has established that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notice of registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the notice, the financial officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the period of assessment for the VAT.
The period of disposition is the calendar quarter, unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10 million.
If this is the case, the period of disposition is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2 000 000 in the preceding calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the accounting period and to inform the financial officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The tax collector must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax officer, in addition, in cases where a specific law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235 / 2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, as determined by a specific law. In the case of legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No. 337 / 1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation, despite a request from the financial officer, the local finance officer must register him ex officio.
A notice will also be issued to the person responsible for the tax.
In the Czech Republic, every businessman approved for business operations receives a tax number at his first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
According to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on January 1, 2005, in the case of non-compliance with the VAT law, the tax officer may require that the taxable person have up to 10% of the revenue from the tax-deductible turnover, which the person concerned has made unlawfully without taxation in 2004, for the period from the date from which the entrepreneur should have been registered as tax collector by the date of registration.
The payment of the fixed amount is considered a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT person can be deleted for two reasons:
(1)
Deletion of the registration at the request of the person responsible for the tax, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law 235 / 2004).
A tax collector can apply for the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force mentioned in the registration notice.
2) the deletion of the registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Law no. 235 / 2004), if: A) the tax collector failed to perform in the period of 12 consecutive months and did not inform the tax officer of the reasons why, b) the tax collector did not fulfil his obligations according to Law no. 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax officer did not meet the conditions for the tax avoidance.
B) tax collectors without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic does not have legal domicile, place of business or establishment, or a tax-exempt foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who has to make a tax declaration and pay taxes for these services or supplies in accordance with section 108 of the Law no. 235 / 2004 ("non-resident company").
He must file an application for registration with the Prague 1 FA at the latest on the day of the delivery.
In this request, he is entitled to indicate all the VAT Idol allocated to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than the day of the first tax-deductible provision of services in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 FA must register him retroactively, since he became subject to VAT according to Law No. 235 / 2004 on the day of the first tax-deductible provision of services in the Czech Republic.
In the case of a retrospective registration, the Prague 1 FA has to demand a certificate (invoices or written explanations) from the operators concerned for the proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, the Prague 1 FA has to demand the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the Prague FA 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of whom were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law 235 / 2004, the tax officer is authorised to delete the registration of a non-resident businessman on 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax filings or declarations and to pay tax.
When examining the NICK, it turned out that in the case of the submission of a tax return by mail with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for the submission of a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of cancelling the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident businessman for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax collectors in Germany
According to the provisions of the tax regulation (§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This application must be made at the latest one month after commencement of business.
The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been commenced but has not been notified, it may also register the tax collector retroactively.
Tax collectors in Germany, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are liable to the registration of Zwekke for VAT if they fulfil the requirements of Section 2 of the German VAT Act (VAT Act).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Foreign-based entrepreneurs are responsible for special requirements.
For example, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of 30 April 2004, there were a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs registered there; 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there as of 1 March 2006.
According to the BRH, these individuals with special responsibilities repeatedly refused the registration of so-called false self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European member states of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the European Union, these self-employed people tried to avoid these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (appearance) self-employed persons do not fulfil the requirements of § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they usually depend on a single client, who determines their working hours and the type of work they perform.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all people in Germany.
It will be processed either in specific organizational units within the organization or in the organizational units that are generally responsible for tax claims.
With the help of this pressure, a risk assessment for the individual tax collector is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.
The establishment of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identifier for the tax collector, the last digit is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO when the tax collector declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-registration or in his VAT annual declaration.
The USt IdNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (for example, if he ceases to do business), but only after the completion of all tax procedures (accounting for all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he is no longer in business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, Fähr must notify the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated at that time.
According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax collectors do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year plus the turnover tax incurred on it did not exceed €17,500 and 2. The amount of €50,000 will probably not be exceeded in the following year.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and make an annual VAT return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the next five years.
He may then charge the sales tax and deduct the pretax.
Non-resident tax collectors can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they exclusively carry out tax-free transactions and waive the deduction of input tax.
The fiscal representative meets the tax requirements of the foreign entrepreneur, so he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold specified in the VAT law.
If an entrepreneur does not cross this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax collector receives a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for domestic German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NCA and the BRH noted that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which has a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive registration (national registration) in cases where the tax collector does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows for a true tendency to value added tax for previous accounting periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax debt.
Since the different registration procedures cause problems, the rules should be standardised throughout the EC.
The German parliament recently approved the introduction of a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to each natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons residing in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up a business, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as the VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax collector and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work has not yet been completed on the implementation of an IT procedure for managing the numbers.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus
Legislation in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004 the carriage of passengers between individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the carriage of persons registered as tax collectors in other Member States or foreigners who are domestically taxable is carried out.
The return journey is considered to be a separate carriage.
If non-resident operators in the Czech Republic carry out no economic activity other than the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus, they are not entitled to be registered in the Czech Republic as subject to turnover tax.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act on the accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b), which states:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with Article 17 of Annex F of the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border transport of persons until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by section 3b (1) of the UStG, a transport service is carried out where the carriage is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) operators.
If a non-resident tax collector transports persons through Germany, the part of the carriage that falls on Germany is considered to be a tax-deductible carriage.
Before providing his services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the relevant FA.
It registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus named in the tax registration.
The entrepreneur must state his tax-deductible transport services in a German VAT declaration.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz South FA.
If the transport service is provided for a domestic entrepreneur, the non-resident tax collector does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic buyer of the services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident taxpayer, which is referred to as the "transfer of tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax collector and his income tax return, the German financial administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to tax-deductible transport of persons:
Mobile control groups of the customs check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for the transport of passengers through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups send an inspection report to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax collector can deduct the value added tax thus paid from the tax debt indicated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT declaration, it can order an examination to take place in the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance mentioned in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign tax collector refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may ask for mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT declaration or compliance with the tax rules by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the small amount of turnover tax on tax-deductible passenger transport.
In particular, the auditing of the books of a non-resident tax collector costs disproportionately for the tax collector himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must check foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination will require more time than a resident tax collector, although the examination will be limited to the transport of persons in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident tax collector must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, as far as he carries out personal transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single transport of persons is carried out, the tax collector must comply with all existing tax rules in the various languages and on the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the law on the Czech Republic's accession to the EU.
In Germany, transport services are subject to a turnover tax in accordance with the route covered by the German territory.
If a non-resident tax collector provides such a service for the first time, he must first report it to the competent FA.
This registers the tax collector, who has to declare the tax-deductible portion of the transport performance in a tax declaration in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax collectors registered with the Chemnitz-South FA have the transport of persons as a business purpose.
The amount of tax in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
The Member States - which collect the turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT, cross-border transport of passengers should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport starts or where the service provider resides.
Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless the law specifies otherwise, even if no tax debt has been incurred, the entrepreneur is contracted to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days after the expiration of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the end of the period for filing the VAT return. The exception to this rule is the VAT on the import of goods according to law 235 / 2004, where the due date of the tax is determined by the customs regulations.
If, as a result of higher-than-average deductible taxes, there is a claim for a refund, this amount will be refunded to the person responsible for the tax within 30 days after fixing this deduction, without the need to make an application.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax debt of the person liable for the tax.
Pursuant to section 73 (11) of Law 235 / 2004, the claim for deduction can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim for deduction was made.
After the expiration of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years after the end of the tax period, in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
For this, however, it is necessary to present a supplementary VAT declaration.
An amendment to Law No. 235 / 2004, which came into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the claim for deduction of VAT could have been made for the first time.
A tax collector must make a supplementary VAT declaration if: (A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax debt, (b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax debt, but only change the previous information, (c) he makes adjustments to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with section 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax collector can make a supplementary VAT declaration if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The tax collector must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.
The sales tax declaration can be made electronically either on the Internet or via data carriers.
Internet delivery can take place with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on a data carrier.
The form for the VAT declaration contains separate lines for the indication of the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some categories are used for automated primary checks within the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered in other EC Member States to persons registered there as tax-compliant is compared with the data indicated by the Czech tax collectors in their Comprehensive Reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered there as tax-compliant is compared with the information in the Comprehensive Reports of tax collectors from other EC Member States by means of the MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA undertakes a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This takes place automatically, since the VAT declaration cannot be processed without the prior inspection.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No. 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a specific tax law or decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
The NCA found in its audit that the tax authorities rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the tax person in question if the VAT declaration was not issued.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between the monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registration and the annual VAT declaration.
Those tax collectors who are licensed to submit VAT pre-registration must nevertheless make an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not contracted to pay VAT will have to make an annual VAT return.
Tax collectors are in principle required to file a sales tax notice by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the sales tax is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT debt amounted to more than €6,136 in the previous year, or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is required to submit monthly pre-tax declarations by the 10th day after the expiration of the respective month at the latest.
The person paying the tax can also opt for the payment of monthly VAT pre-registration if he has been refunded more than €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual turnover tax is not more than €512, neither VAT pre-registration nor VAT returns have to be made.
A resulting value-added tax debt must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to obtain a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
In principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (surrender or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly reports, a special advance payment has to be made.
This payment will be calculated against the VAT debt established for the pre-registration period in December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must make a corrected VAT declaration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT declaration.
Once the VAT declaration to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT declaration.
Correction of this VAT declaration to the advantage or disadvantage of the person responsible for the tax is possible within four years after the expiration of the year in which the first VAT declaration was made.
After the expiration of this four-year period, a VAT declaration can usually only be corrected in cases of careless tax reduction or tax evasion.
Tax collectors must submit pre-tax declarations by electronic means.
The pledges can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT declaration can be made in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the submission takes place without certification, the tax collector must make the declaration on paper and with his / her personal signature.
If no VAT declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax collective6.
In the case of late payment, a delay surcharge can be imposed on the tax payer (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to €25,000).
In an earlier investigation, the BRH found that the airlines often do not charge this delay surcharge.
In the cases where the fees are collected, the amount is fixed in an inconsistent and arbitrary manner.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular in the submission of the annual VAT declaration.
The form of the VAT declaration contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable transactions are to be specified in a separate line of the VAT declaration.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially appointed personnel.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are immediately available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is electronically recorded, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made based on certain criteria.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the test notes drawn up automatically (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the turnover tax debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax collectors must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, tax collectors have to file their advance applications at the latest 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax debt of the previous year.
The annual declaration of VAT must be made by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The requirement to submit an annual VAT return has several advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax collector can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registration by submitting a single VAT return;
- if the tax collector reports his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific ZM reporting period;
- The federal states do not share MIAS data on intra-Community purchases of German taxpayers until the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must make a VAT declaration regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy will enable the German financial administration to check the compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can adjust the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company in question.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only check the amount of the turnover on the basis of the income tax declaration.
Contrary to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German tax collectors are liable for the electronic submission of the VAT pre-registration.
The introduction of the electronic tax declaration system in the Czech Republic would increase the effectiveness of the Czech tax administration.
Summary notices
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes is required to make such summary declarations (hereinafter "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always given in Czech currency in the ZM, according to the VAT IdNr7, the individual tax collectors under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly period of taxation have to hand over the ZM to the local FA at the latest on the 25th day after the expiration of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days after the error has been detected.
Erroneous data in the ZM are always replaced by data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, tax collectors can also submit the ZM electronically.
If a tax collector does not issue a ZM or correction ZM, even though it is provided for by law no. 235 / 2004, the financial officer must ask him to surrender the ZM in question and assign it to the consequences of the non-payment. In the case of non-monetary claims, the financial officer is authorised to repeatedly impose fines of up to 2 million CZK, in accordance with section 37 of Law No 337 / 1992.
The NICK found in its audit that the tax authorities mostly did not use their power to impose fines against their defaulting taxpayers.
In particular, the tax collectors are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations when submitting the ZM, since the omitted payment of an ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT debt.
Pursuant to section 102 (5) of Law 235 / 2004, the financial officer is required to check the information in the ZM or the correction ZM, to remove all ambiguity and to use the information to fix the tax debt.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxman corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system, if:
- the tax officer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- the financial officer has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxman in the ZM or the correction ZM.
The correction received by the financial officer, without a correction ZM being made by the tax officer, does not replace the tax inspector's right to make a correction ZM, but only leads to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that it is current, complete and accurate.
The ZM data will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the message "O _ MCTL" automatically receives the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr., which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry will be made in the wrong VAT ID list.
The list contains a "report of doubts regarding UST IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the tax collector must indicate this in his VAT declaration and enter the value of the acquisition in the specified value-added tax return.
Selected cases of differences between the value of purchases made by the Czech tax payer in his VAT declaration and the value of goods delivered by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The clerks there must investigate the discrepancies.
Three different situations can occur:
A) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant categories of its VAT declaration is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer will check the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation may result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT declaration (the Czech tax collector in the meantime makes a supplementary VAT declaration on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT declaration.
C) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech tax collector has indicated in his VAT declaration, is higher than the value of the shipments reported by suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Again, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the finance officer enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be transmitted to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for inspection can be seen in graph No. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance) for the various quarters of 2005.
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO has decreased for the different quarters of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number of cases in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for the selection of cases to the other EC Member States, taking into account the minimum amount limit for requests for information.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on a mistake on the part of the national purchaser.
There may also be an error by the taxman in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies are indicated differently in the ZM in the different EC Member States.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions identified in the audited cases can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of Comprehensive Notices in Germany
Operators who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or take part in triangular transactions are required to submit quarterly ZM, which lists intra-Community deliveries to purchasers (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter concerned.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of sales tax pre-applications, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been phased out.
The competent FA can allow exemptions for individual tax dodgers in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the person in charge of the tax notices that the ZM was defective, he is liable to make a correction ZM within one month.
In the case of non-payment of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, together with the threat of a penalty payment being set and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows a penalty of up to €25,000 (Section 329 AO) to be set, the CLO imposes fines of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG specifies that the person liable to tax acts contrary to the law if he or she intentionally or recklessly fails to deliver a ZM correctly, completely or on time, or if he or she fails to correct an ZM in time.
This infringement can be punished with a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the companies, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.
The ZM data is only stored by the CLO.
The information from the Comprehensive Notices will only be available to the Fähr after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT number in the ZM of German tax collectors, the German CLO receives a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the correct data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then his job to request the right information.
In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most operators corrected the VAT ID number at the request of the CLO.
However, remembering, threatening and fixing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time when a tax collector may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases that were ultimately reported to the competent authorities were usually completed within one to two months.
The competent FA refused exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these expirations9.
If the tax collector presented the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the tax authorities cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FTE nor the CLO controlled the submission of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the tax collectors often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information given in the VAT estimates or the VAT declaration on the delivery of goods with the corresponding data in the ZM before these data are transmitted to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the tax authorities, usually during the preparation of a special VAT check.
Data received from other Member States is processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of the tax on labour in the Member States.
Once they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notices will be drawn up and sent to the competent authorities.
This is done continuously, whereas the acquisition data of all VAT collectors will be compiled later and sent to the tax authorities.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then balances these data with those for intra-Community purchases.
The system completely checks (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax collectors who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered in another Member State for VAT must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
They process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax collectors in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same tax collectors in their VAT declarations.
The results of the comparison will be taken into account in the tax setting.
In Germany, tax collectors who have made intra-Community deliveries are liable to surrender quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, tax collectors have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM will only be available to the users after its processing by the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax collectors only specify the deliveries of goods in the ZM.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech Fähr, the German Fähr cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the ZM.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the person in charge reported the correct VAT ID number to the FA.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German tax collectors in their VAT pre-registration with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-registration and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings by the BRH, it is evident that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
Data provided by other Member States on shipments of goods to Czech tax collectors will be compared in the Czech Republic with data on purchases of goods indicated by Czech tax collectors in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes a separate comparison for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviation will be sent to the courts for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community purchases.
Such a general control is only applied to tax collectors who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community purchases of other tax entities only if the RMS has drawn up an audit notice or the person responsible for the tax has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the pleading from clarifying the reasons for the differences that occur.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community purchases must be available as soon as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax collectors had to hand over monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would increase the bureaucratic burden only insignificantly, since most tax collectors in the Czech Republic and Germany are already liable for the submission of monthly VAT returns or pre-filings and for which ZM does not require more information than for VAT returns or preliminary declarations.
In order to avoid red tape, the ZM levy could be linked to the submission of VAT returns or advance declarations.
However, a monthly payment of ZM would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community purchases and increase the data flows between the CLOs.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the monthly surrender of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the common monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on shipments and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2.
Both courts requested data on the number of false tax numbers or VAT ID number in O _ MCTL messages exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTL message was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
International exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax entities that have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic forms of exchange of information: Exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
International exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information ("request for information RFI") using the standardised SCAC pre-print.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or responses to an RFI obtained through the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which is responsible for translating the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and forwarding it to other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It obtains their translation into the Czech Republic and distributes them to the competent FEB for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany in the tested period have been checked by the NK.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NK had examined it. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to the requests made by Germany can be found in chart 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) received from the Czech Republic to Germany, in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiration of this period and in 19 cases there was currently no answer from Germany to the examination by the NK (in the remaining one case it was not possible to find the answer based on the information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic were answered from Germany can be found in graph no. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graph no. 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information usually had a value of more than €60,000.
International exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured or in the form of instant information.
Information is often provided to financial officials in other Member States without any prior request, which is important for fixing the value added tax debt.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected by the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
According to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, "automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to other Member States at regular, predetermined intervals without any prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The financial officer obtains this information from the form of notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer will provide the required data in the document and forward it directly to the responsible representative of the Finance Directorate, where these data will be collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and potential "missing traders."
This information is transmitted to other Member States by means of a SCAC pre-print in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for information requests and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local competent FA.
Please send the completed copy of SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which will forward the SCACVordrucke to the foreign CLO.
They are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACVordruck used is one-page.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of the intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the supplies mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable reason for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides for the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or English.
In response to the request for information, the CLO will refer the request to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.
At the various levels of the German financial administration, no further deadlines have been set.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the German CLO of the response to uncompleted requests for information.
You will receive the information you need by writing to the tax agent or conducting an external audit.
External auditors usually choose between two types of assessment: The special VAT check, which covers all tax-related transactions over a period of several months, or the so-called value-added tax check, which may only refer to a recent operation.
With this short and unavoidable form of examination, it is not necessary to make an announcement to the person responsible for the tax and it has proved itself in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany sends the following information to the other Member State: - on VAT IdNr., which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States; - on the refund of VAT to operators resident in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has agreed to provide the following information to the other EC Member States in the context of structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT, e.g. distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between purchases reported by a tax collector and MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of items which have been made by the tax collector or which have been inappropriately subjected to taxation in Germany, e. Misappropriation of which has been made by the tax collector, is not valid within the tax system.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities, who send the corresponding SCACVordrucke to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACVordrucke (Czech-English) and translates information provided into English or German, the German texts follow the instruction to write requests for information or instant information only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NCA found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information made to Germany were only dealt with by the German financial administration in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO points to the three-month period, it does not monitor its adherence.
Due to the absence of reminders, there is a high proportion of requests for information that have been answered in freezing conditions.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO has meanwhile reminded the tax offices of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of sales tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The department for methodology and economic management of sales tax or its unit for risk management deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion of "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion within the framework of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk products, prepares the risk management in the area of turnover tax in a conceptual manner and cooperates in this area with the competent EC institutions and the other Member States.
The department for international mutual assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and implementation of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The tax audit and tax investigation department carries out, among other things, risk analyses in the framework of the methodical management of tax audits, defines priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, compiles risk analyses for the fight against tax evasion and, in this context, gathers information from the financial administration and other sources, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax Enforcement Services are established by the Finance Directors.Their tasks include the search for tax collectors and sectors that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet stores, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax collectors (e.g. Internet services, labour mediation, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of suspicions in cases of fraud, and the information of local tax authorities.
Special exam units have been set up in 12 selected courses.
These have a regional competence and carry out tax audits outside the local area of jurisdiction of the Fähr on the basis of the corresponding authorisation.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in relation to chain transactions.
These special units examine according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax collectors with specific activities, multinational companies and tax collectors with particularly high turnover rates.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of turnover tax have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk effectiveness of tax returns, - the "selection of the taxable persons to be audited," whereby the taxable persons to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria, - the "MIAS" task, which allows financial officials to access the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task "MIAS" makes possible, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT Idn of taxable persons from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax person, as stated in the ZM of all the suppliers of the tax person in question from other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not submitted the ZM, formal control of the data of the tax person in their tax person from other Member States, the creation of other Member States whose ZM does not appear in the information about the ZM of the ZM.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from state agencies such as the Commercial Register, Land Registry Office, Motor Vehicle Registry, Commercial Register, etc.
More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the Comprehensive Notices in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, in the Federal Republic of Germany, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete set of data.
At the level of the CLO, the unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as the "KUSS" - Coordinating Unit for VAT Special Examinations and Tax Enforcement Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud cases in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at the KUSS, where the tax authorities can enter and retrieve the names of discovered missing traders or VAT cheats.
The CUSTOMER coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at the national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the KUSS will be incorporated into the development of the RMS through their collaboration in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The CLO will carry out a formal review of the composition of VAT No. of other Member States that appear in the ZM of German taxpayers.
This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT IdNo. referred to in the ZM is tested on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers supplied by the other Member States (for the procedure of rectifying invalid VAT Idn., see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of messages on the discovery of suspected Missing Traders. Certain characteristics, which usually occur in carousel transactions, are used as clues.
In certain cases, the federal states are instructed to process these notices and have to report the outcome of their investigations to the CLO.
The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to be sufficiently likely to suggest a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different indications in the preparation of the messages.
The risk management system should also take into account other indicators, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the economic sector or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of sales tax pre-applications and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of tax collectors who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT estimates or annual declarations.
This list will be sent to the CLO to monitor the full submission of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the tax person in his annual VAT declaration are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, since it would lead to too many discrepancies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- the supplier and the purchaser assume different times for the execution of the intra-Community turnover;
- different accounting and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many German states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, the age of the owners / partners, the number of employees and the method of payment of the tax credit).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules to identify suspected tax cheats.
This system is used to process VAT estimates.
This will give the competent FA the information of the RMS before the VAT is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adjust the rules according to the feedback from the questions.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected cases of deprivation.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the relevant tax collectors.
After the audit, the tax examiners must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it has proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on many data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the data-mining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax collector is to be involved in tax fraud.
It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax cheats.
On the basis of this list, the Fähr select the relevant tax collectors for examination and report the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for the fight against fraud appears to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the desired effects will be achieved in actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although in this report it is not possible to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NK and BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
An exchange of experience on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud is currently taking place between the tax authorities of the European Member States.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has turned out not to be a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in the fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
One Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator resides.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud can be affected.
This is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel tests, the NK and BRH examined the quality and usefulness of information on selected deliveries and / or
The international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two tax authorities jointly examined the execution of several deliveries, about which there were doubts, or which the tax authorities of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NCA examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax collectors.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of notices from the BRH, the NCA examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax collectors had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NCO, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax collectors.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to MIAS data, a Czech tax collector purchased €60,500 worth of goods from a German tax collector in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech tax collector declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to check the value of the delivered goods.
The German side indicated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German tax collector in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
Furthermore, the answer showed that the VAT ID number of the German tax collector was not valid until 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had accepted a further application from the German tax authority and had brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax officer corrected the ZM.
Based on this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax collector.
By way of a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NCA found that in 2004 the Czech tax collector had made supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-age) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of VAT from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was included in the declared purchases.
In response to a request for information from the NCA, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to turnover tax in September 2003.
At the time of registration, however, he had not ever applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only for a tax number that finally applied to Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a VAT ID number to a person subject to tax, in 2006 the responsible clerk of the German financial administration did so retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID number retroactively if the German operator has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay following the request of the tax authority for the issuance of a VAT ID No.
In this case, the CLO will issue the VAT ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not require a valid VAT ID number for an intra-Community delivery in accordance with § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of its supplier to explain the intra-Community acquisition.
Due to these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT ID number in this particular case retroactively.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for the verification of the German entrepreneur's VAT registration.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is March 5, 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates October 1, 2004.
The German authorities announced in their reply that the German tax practitioner was registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons was not allocated a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005.
In response to a request from the local Czech Treasury official, the NCO learned that the tax officer had carried out a VAT audit for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
On this examination, the tax office found that the Czech tax collector had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German tax collectors before their VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office set a tax debt of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 against the Czech tax payer.
In response to the question from the NK, the BRH found that the German tax collector had only been allocated the VAT ID number when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the submission of the VAT declaration for 2004.
In this VAT declaration, the tax collector gave intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic in the value of 160 €(about 5.000 CZK).
3. In his sales tax declaration for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector gave goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax collector.
When checking the registration of the German tax collector in the MIAS system, the Czech finance official found that this registration was not valid until 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods had been shipped to Germany.
The Czech tax collector made a supplementary VAT declaration in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NCCC found that the Czech tax collector subsequently submitted an application to reopen the tax procedure in the case of the supplementary VAT declaration. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation to the German tax administration that the German tax collector had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech finance official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax person in the context of international exchange of information.
According to the German information, the German tax collector was not allocated a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of the delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech finance official rejected the request to reopen the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case there had been no intra-Community purchase of goods, because the German tax collector had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
The German recipient, however, declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community purchase and the value-added tax and also demanded the refund of pre-taxes at the same level.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax debt of the German tax collector, the German finance official did not correct the information in the VAT declaration.
The BRH also noted that the company of the German tax collector mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax collectors.
This change in the name of the German tax collector also confused the Czech finance official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German finance official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax collector from a German tax collector worth €22,686.
Through a request from the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKKA found that the Czech tax officer had examined, during an external audit of the Czech tax authority, whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax collector had recorded and paid the bill for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax collector did not explain the intrinsically bad acquisition in his VAT declaration, because the German supplier did not indicate his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number, which is intended for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax collector will not be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax collector.
The Czech finance official also requested that the German financial administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax collector, so that if necessary he could initiate a corresponding tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose a VAT on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a tax collector who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and must be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to employment taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech finance officer took note of this business incident, because the delivery of a machine of this value did not belong to the core business of the German supplier.
As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount of €15,000: 5.
According to MIAS data, a Czech tax collector purchased €12,561 worth of goods from a German tax collector in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this period of taxation.
As part of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the verification of the delivery of the goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech tax collector said that he had not received the goods, had never been in contact with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been booked with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of receipts - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other reasons had been given.
Since the Czech tax officer did not receive any documents for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax assessment was not successful and the original tax determination remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the NCA, the BRH found that the German tax collector acted as a "fiscal representative" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax authority explained these deliveries in its sales tax declaration and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification from the BRH, the German FA will send the documents necessary for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. In its audit, the NK found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of the supply of goods to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax collector reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax collector in the value of €86,307; however, the Czech tax collector only declared the purchase of goods in the value of €35,314 for the same period in his VAT declaration.
In response to the request for information, which was sent to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiration of the maximum period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech finance official asked for verification of a third and fourth quarter 2004 delivery of cars to a German tax collector worth €1,265,554 by means of a SCAC form, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NK found that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
Through a request from the local finance officer, the NKKähr found that the Czech tax collector had not explained in his VAT declaration the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German tax collector in the value of CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech finance official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax inspector issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for consideration.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT assessment was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany, which found that the purchase of all the vehicles in question had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were sold to other tax collectors in Germany.
8. According to MIAS data, the Czech tax collector purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German tax collector in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech tax collector did not declare an intra-Community purchase.
In a request to the local finance officer in the Czech Republic, the NKKähr found that the Czech tax collector had not made a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax collector did not make any tax returns, even when requested by the financial officer. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the value-added tax debt for the period October to December 2004 at zero.
On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an instruction for the examination of the mentioned delivery by the German tax authority.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the financial officer, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the response to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the completion of the examination of the NK how the Czech Treasury official used the information obtained during the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the provisions of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply has been sent, because at the time of the NCA and BRH audit, the competent FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, by means of a SCAC print, the Czech finance official asked for the verification of a third-quarter 2004 delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax collector worth €16,991, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German finance official indicated that he had only received invoices for deliveries worth €16,335 issued by the Czech tax authority.
On the basis of the question from the NK, the BRH found that the external examination carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the purchaser in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its pre-tax declarations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, by means of a SCAC form, a Czech finance official asked for verification of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax collector in the value of €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The German financial administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax collector had purchased several vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NCA found that the local FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech tax collector in order to check the deduction of above-average pre-tax rates.
However, an unauthorised claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax collector had declared the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 for the period in question in his VAT returns, and that the German FA's examination of the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community purchases in the recipient's VAT declaration and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodical discrepancies or incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11.
According to MIAS data, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German tax collector, but the Czech tax collector did not declare the acquisition.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the financial officer and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech finance official asked for an assessment of how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech one during the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information showed that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax collector was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed shipping agent.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax collector only supplied goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax collector sent the German tax collector a false payment confirmation of the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax collector.
After revealing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax collector, with the support of his other Czech clients, was able to recover the material delivered, with the exception of a part of the value of €7,916.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKKähr found that, based on the information received, the financial administration subsequently applied VAT on shipments of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 to the Czech tax authority.
On the basis of a request from the NK, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had reported only one delivery of goods to the Czech tax collector, worth €7,916, after correction.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authority declared the withdrawal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the withdrawal.
His ZM provided the following information to the Czech tax authorities:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested verification of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCACVordruck.
According to the request for information, the Czech tax collector had in the period in question supplied the German tax collector with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.
The NCA found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit of the Czech tax collector in order to investigate the delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax collector had delivered and installed a production facility to the German company.
The Czech tax officer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was installed on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax collector did not remove the assembled production line and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax collector charged the German the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax collector received the rebates, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.
In response to a request from the local finance officer in the Czech Republic, the NCCC found that all invoices had been properly recorded on the books of the Czech tax collector.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech tax collector and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that the local FA came to the conclusion, on the basis of the response of the Czech financial administration, that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax collector to the German one, including the assembly done.
In this particular case, the place of fulfilment for this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is installed.
The German recipient of the work delivery owes the sales tax according to the German VAT law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
The German FA did not correct the VAT declaration, as the German tax authority's liability for turnover remained unchanged.
13. According to MIAS data, Czech tax collector A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from German tax collector C. in February 2005.
The Czech finance official sent a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax collector C had delivered the machine in 2004 to the Czech tax collector B, who returned it to the German tax collector C in October 2004.
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax authority C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it also emerged that the German tax collector C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax collector A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German tax collector's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no common delivery of goods.
By way of a request to the local tax officer responsible for fiscal B, the NCA found that according to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, the German tax accountant C had delivered goods worth €88,027 to the Czech tax collector (another machine).
Tax officer B said he did not receive the goods, so the local Czech finance official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations into the tax collector B, the tax officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been registered with the tax collector B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German tax collector C had delivered to the Czech tax collector A in February 2005.
The NCA also found that the Czech tax officer in charge of tax-dodging A had carried out an audit of the latter.
The financial officer had the invoice of the German tax authority C of 7 February 2005, in which the tax person A is to be specified as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech finance official noted that tax collector A had not recorded this bill.
Tax officer A had signed a lease agreement with another Czech company, whose object was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of tax collector A.
The BRH found that the German tax collector C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax collector D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-compliant delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German finance official did not recognise the claim of the German tax authority C on VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
German tax collector D delivered the machine to Czech tax collector B.
According to German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that the German tax accountant C, in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005, had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax collector A.
This delivery was not checked during the German FA's tax audit.
The figure below shows the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining the requests for information received, the NCA found that on October 4, 2005, the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German finance official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax credit worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax collector.
The German finance official indicated that there was a suspicion that this was a preventive intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German tax collector has not been active in business since 1999.
The NCA found that the Czech Treasury official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax collector.
The head of the Czech company said it was probably a claim of the German tax authority against the German financial administration, which the Czech tax authority had claimed as a shareholder in the German company in the German FA.
According to the information given to the NK, the Czech finance official has not yet been informed that the German financial administration is handling the case with respect to the Czech tax collectors.
From the information available, it appears that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax collector.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the omission of the intra-Community acquisition in the recipients' tax returns (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax collector supplied a Czech tax payer with a total value of €33,205.
However, the Czech tax collector did not declare the acquisition within the Community.
The Czech finance official asked for an assessment of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the interstate exchange of information.
In response to this request for information, the German side said that the German tax collector had sent a part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax collector, and that he had personally picked up the remaining goods.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NCA found that the Czech tax collector had made a supplementary VAT declaration for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the value of the purchases could not be clarified, so the Czech finance official recommended a tax audit of the Czech tax authority.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German tax collector had delivered €46,854 worth of goods to a Czech tax collector.
For the same period, a Czech tax collector declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the interstate exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31,999 €, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech tax authority and the MIAS data.
In response to a request from the local Czech tax officer, the NK found that after receiving the answer from Germany, it had turned to the accountant of the Czech tax authority and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about the submission of a supplementary VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2004.
Until now, no supplementary VAT declaration has been made.
The Czech treasury official told the NK that it would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactively setting the turnover tax for the respective tax period would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax collector delivered €11,600 worth of goods to the German tax collector.
As part of the interstate exchange of information, the German finance official asked for a check on whether the mentioned Czech tax collectors actually existed, since the alleged owner of the German tax collectors had created a number of false claims in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the operation, the Czech tax collector confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authority, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax collector presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax collector was not registered as subject to turnover tax in Germany and did not tax the sale of the goods in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech finance official provided these details in his reply to the request for information to the German financial administration.
In a request to the local Czech tax officer, the NCO stated that the Czech tax collector had made a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German tax collector and at the same time asserted the right to deduct VAT on purchases from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT declaration, he did not declare any sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which was issued after the external audit, the Czech financial officer determined the value added tax debt unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case, there was no acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech Treasury official drew a false conclusion in the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax officer corrected the tax return and demanded the payment of sales tax of €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, operators declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German financial administration on whether the Czech tax collector had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax collector in February 2005.
A copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax collector was attached to the request for information.
As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial officer discovered that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not introduced a vehicle to the Czech Republic and indicated that he had no contacts with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which was sent by the German side, was not issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech finance official responded to the request for information and said at the same time that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKKähr stated that the Czech tax collector does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the company's managing director is not available.
After a tax appeal procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech Treasury official determined the tax debt of the Czech tax collector to be zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German finance official had refused the claim of the German tax authority to exempt this supply from the VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was not able to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods indicated in the VAT declaration and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax collector should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax collector in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax authority was not in accordance with the MIAS data, the German finance official requested the verification of the deliveries and their payment within the framework of the interstate exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official indicated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been removed from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the Czech company's shareholder.
The Czech tax collector issued a VAT return and a ZM, which, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register, was signed by an unauthorised person, namely this shareholder of the company.
The accountant of the Czech tax collector informed the financial officer that the owner of the capital had paid the payment in euros to the company's account for the goods invoiced.
Cash receipts have not been issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NK stated that the financial officer had recognised the Czech tax authority's claim to VAT exemption for shipments of goods to other Member States, worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax officer did not correct the German purchaser's VAT declaration, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax collector.
Since the previous external audit showed no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT debt.
20. According to MIAS data, a German tax collector purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 the previous year.
The German tax collector did not declare the intra-Community purchases in his 2004 VAT declaration or in the 2005 one.
In addition, he did not explain the value of the initial sales.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the 4th quarter 2005 and the 1st quarter 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community shipments of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax authority had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration said that the German request could not be met because the Czech company does not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
Documents provided to the NCA by the competent financial officer show that on 30 March 2006, together with the managing director of the Czech tax authority, a protocol for the commencement of the sales tax audit for the 4th quarter 2004 and the period January to December 2005 was drawn up.
At the same time, the tax officer asked the tax officer to provide all accounting and tax documents for this period, but omitted to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the only managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech tax collector has not issued any tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NCA, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the cases under review via the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct tax-deductible business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered in June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria in the name, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient manufacturing capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax collector (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationship and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria in its name, at its own risk and for its own installation bill.
Due to the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the carrier was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as tax-compliant in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is a different country from the seat of the Czech business19.
Accordingly, the delivery will be properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) has claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The location of the Czech company's (UCR) delivery also depends on where the transport began.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM made against the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have uniformly treated all its intra-Community deliveries as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NCP found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to secure the taxation of intra-Community purchases in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NCA and the BRH reviewed case studies to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different laws of 2004.
The cases also show that it takes some time for tax collectors and tax collectors to apply the new legal requirements:
22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax person reported shipments of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax collector.
In the same period, another Czech tax collector reported in his ZM intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector for a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
According to the information provided by the BRH to the NCBs, both cases involved the supply of electricity.
Both Czech tax collectors took into account the above-mentioned deliveries according to the Czech law no. 235 / 2004, which is in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NK found that in 2004 there were different legal requirements regarding the supply or purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax collectors declared the supplies of electrical energy in accordance with the provisions of the law No. 235 / 2004, valid in 2004, as intra-Community deliveries of goods, according to the German legal regulations in 2004, it was not a intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635 / 2004, which changed some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or purchases in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax collector in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 made intra-Community deliveries to a German tax collector in the total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax collector in his ZM for the same period made intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector in the value of CZ73,70,776.
The information provided by the BRH to the NCBs showed that in both cases it was a matter of supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law no. 235 / 2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for which the purchaser has its legal domicile, registered office or establishment for which this delivery is made is the place of performance for which the purchaser has its legal seat, registered office or establishment.
For this reason, the Czech tax authorities should not have specified the electricity supplies in their 2005 ZM.
In MIAS, the fact that both operators treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies resulted in a difference of CZK 503,881,939.
Closing note
Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NK have been achieved.
Both courts have gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or purchases were revealed.
For some of them, further observation is worth it.
On the basis of the audit results, both audit courts drew up recommendations for the management of the turnover tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both courts of auditors form the basis for the successful execution of future audits in the area of VAT administration.
