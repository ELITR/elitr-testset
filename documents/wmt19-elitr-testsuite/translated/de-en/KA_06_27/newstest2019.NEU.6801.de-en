Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Court of Auditors has the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the courts of auditors have the power to scrutinise tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenues.
This is particularly true for taxes, which are the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, there may be a situation in which national auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the auditors of other states.
As an example, the examination of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many countries.
Cooperation between the authorities is necessary in the fight against such crimes.
Courts of auditors in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the VAT and the MIAS system arose at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the examination subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
The subject of the examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT following the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
the Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the investigation in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the abovementioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to address them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the verification of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of the VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The period examined covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two auditors.
In addition to the focus on the exchange of information provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of tax documents, tax returns and summary notifications.
The audit also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
Comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for sales tax purposes.
Whereas in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered irrespective of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT law.
In the Czech Republic, tax payers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax payer receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German tax payer wants to make significant intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduct the VAT.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to sales tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic tax returns only have to be made for under-year tax periods (month or quarter), tax payers in Germany have tax returns (monthly or quarterly)
Submit VAT advance notifications and a VAT annual declaration after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany have to submit the VAT advance notifications electronically.
The introduction of the requirement for the electronic submission of VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary notifications.
While tax payers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary notifications to the tax offices (FÄ), German tax payers have to submit the summary notifications to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information contained in the summary notifications will be available to FÄ in the Czech Republic as soon as they have been submitted.
The information from the summary notifications will only be available to German FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as quickly as possible.
The monthly submission of summary notifications would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the updating of MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
In the case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the prescribed period.
Due to these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO that the deadlines be constantly monitored (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
As part of the cooperation, the two Court of Auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly examined using the legal possibilities of the CLO where there were doubts about correct taxation or suspicions of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and reestablished the VAT liability of the tax payers concerned.
In these cases, the tax payers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not indicate the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the information requested.
Some cases have been uncovered in which tax payers incorrectly reported sales in their summary notifications.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the experts (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited bodies were: Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NKÚ approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedure in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the audit area of traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following FÄ were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zopau.
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the examination were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both auditors took place.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in each other's country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics for the parallel examinations were identified: 1.
Registration of tax payers.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the approach of financial officials in the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on supplies and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the VAT area.
At a meeting in December 2006 to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel audits already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a registered office, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months shall be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Law No. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a tax payer if it has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who provides sales tax services or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million but fulfils other conditions set out in Law No 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure in accordance with Law No 337 / 1992 begins when the application for registration is received by the local tax official.
If you want to register voluntarily for sales tax, you must specify in your application the cut-off date from which you apply for registration as a sales tax payer.
The financial officer must examine the information provided by the trader, i.e. the completed application for registration with all the installations.
If he has doubts about the information contained therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
If the financial officer has verified that the entrepreneur fulfils the conditions for registration, he has to give a written notification of the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the financial officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration of the sales tax and the assessment period for the sales tax.
The investment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the predisposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 is entitled to choose the calendar month as an investment period and must inform the financial officer of this change.
The granting of a tax number in the registration order is always constitutive.
The tax-payer must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax official, as well as in cases where this is required by a special law (e.g. Law No 235 / 2004, concerning the production of tax documents) 3.
The control number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification sign.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification sign, insofar as this is determined by a special law.
If, despite a request from the finance official, the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his lease, the local finance official must register him on his own initiative.
A decision will also be made on this, which will go to the tax payer.
In the Czech Republic, each trader admitted to a business activity will receive a tax number for any type of tax at the time of his first registration.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
In accordance with Law No 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-fulfilment of the obligation to register the turnover tax, the tax officer may require that up to 10% of the proceeds from the tax-related turnover that the person concerned has unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date from which the trader should have been registered as a tax agent, until the date on which the registration as a tax officer was made by the order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004).
The payment of the amount set in this way is considered to be a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or a penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT holder can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the tax office, i.e. mainly because the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
A tax payer may request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of the registration on its own initiative (§ 106 (7) of Law No 235 / 2004) if: a) the tax payer has not provided a service for the period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax official of the reasons for this, b) the tax payer has not fulfilled its obligations under Law No 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax payer no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax levies.
B) Taxpayers without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have his legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for such services or deliveries in accordance with § 108 of Law No 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") shall be taxed with the provision of the service in question.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
He is required to indicate in this application all the VAT ID numbers assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became taxable in accordance with Law No 235 / 2004 on the day of the first taxable provision of services in the Czech Republic.
In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require the contractors concerned to provide proof (invoices or written explanations) of the performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the FA Prague 1 must demand the submission of the contract documents on the basis of performance.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year, if he does not accept the obligation to submit tax declarations or declarations and to pay taxes.
The examination of the NKÚ showed that in the case of the submission of a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the obligatory deadline for the submission of a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax payers in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulation (§ 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after the commencement of business activities.
The municipality passes on the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has been started but has not been notified, it can also register the tax payers retroactively on its own initiative.
In Germany, tax payers, irrespective of whether they are resident or not resident, are leased for registration for purposes of sales tax if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Entrepreneurs resident abroad are responsible for special FÄ.
For example, for those entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the Federal Republic of Germany, these FÄ with special competences frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the European Union, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (note) self-employed persons do not meet the conditions laid down in § 2 of the UStG for recognition as an entrepreneur, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the way in which they carry out their work.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the FÄ or in the organisational units generally responsible for the tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual tax payer before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the tax payer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to be able to make duty-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the tax payer declares intra-Community deliveries in its VAT pre-registrations or in its annual VAT declaration.
The USt-IdNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. when he stops doing business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (predisposition of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the FÄ must notify the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at that time.
According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax payers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the subsequent sales tax has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of €50,000 in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small entrepreneurs are required to register with the tax office and submit an annual sales tax return.
A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then invoice the sales tax and deduct the advance tax.
Non-resident tax payers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free transactions and refrain from deducting VAT.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for sales tax purposes.
The bills indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceeding of the threshold set out in the VAT law.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences can occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax payer will receive a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for the VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number both for national VAT registration and for intra-Community transactions, could lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the tax payer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows an accurate assessment of the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax debt.
As the different registration procedures cause problems, the rules for the whole of the EC should be harmonised.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxes to each natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up a business activity, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
Legislative provisions in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of § 70 of Law No 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to a deduction of VAT.
The VAT exemption will also apply if the carriage is carried out by persons registered as tax payers in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable domestically.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not required to register in the Czech Republic as subject to sales tax.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, in accordance with point 17 in Annex F to the Directive, the Czech Republic may maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) of the UStG, a carriage service is carried out where the carriage is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is tax-exempt in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident tax payer transports a person through Germany, the part of the carriage incurred in Germany is considered to be tax-free transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each bus mentioned in the registration of the tax office.
The entrepreneur must indicate his tax-related transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided for a resident entrepreneur, the non-resident tax payer does not have to pay the sales tax to the FA himself.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident tax payer, which is referred to as the "transfer of the tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax payer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means to check the correctness of the tax return with regard to tax-related personal promotions:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can ask the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax payer can deduct the sales tax paid in this way from the tax debt stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts as to the correctness of a VAT return, it may order an examination to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign tax payer refuses to pay the legally fixed turnover tax, the FA may request assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these funds of mutual assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT return or compliance with the tax burden by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the small amount of the turnover tax on tax-bound passenger transport.
In particular, auditing the books of a non-resident tax payer incurs disproportionately high costs for the tax payer himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination is expected to involve a higher amount of time than a resident tax payer, although the examination is limited to the passenger transports carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident tax payer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single passenger transport is carried out, the tax-payer must comply with all existing tax requirements in the different languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
As a result, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation varies between the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States as well as between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession to the EC of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to sales tax in accordance with the transport route incurred on German territory.
If a non-resident tax payer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify it to the relevant FA beforehand.
This registers the tax payer, who has to declare the tax-deductible share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax payers registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax - have a high administrative burden relative to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of the VAT predisposition, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state in which the carriage begins or in which the service provider is established.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Submission and processing of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic
Unless the law stipulates otherwise, even if no tax debt has been incurred, the entrepreneur is required to submit a VAT return on the form set by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.
The tax liability is incurred at the expiry of the period for the submission of the VAT return. Excluded from this provision is the VAT on the import of goods according to Law No. 235 / 2004.
If there is a refund entitlement as a result of above-average deductible advance taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the deduction being set, without the need to make an application for it.
The deadline will not be applied in cases where the tax official initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the tax payer.
Pursuant to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduction of VAT may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduction of VAT has arisen.
After the expiry of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period during which it would have been possible to apply for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary sales tax return.
An amendment to Law No 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduction of VAT could have been asserted for the first time.
A tax payer must make a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax debt, b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax debt, but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax debt in accordance with § 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax payer can make a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax debt.
The tax payer must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question have been established.
The sales tax return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The surrender via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
The value of related services must be indicated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as tax-exempt is compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summary notifications.
The value of the purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as taxable persons is compared with the information in the summary notifications of tax authorities from other EC Member States with the help of MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the benchmarks for credibility and an assessment of the risks of the VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of § 37 (1) of Law No 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its investigation, the NKÚ found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the tax payer in question if the VAT return was not issued.
Submission and processing of VAT declarations in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT advance notifications and the annual VAT return.
Those tax payers who are leased to submit VAT advance notifications will still have to make an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not leased to pay the sales tax must make an annual VAT return.
In principle, the tax payers are required to submit a VAT advance notification until the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the sales tax is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT debt exceeds €6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is required to submit monthly VAT advance notifications no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The tax payer can also opt for the submission of monthly VAT advance registrations if he has been reimbursed an amount of more than €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual turnover tax is no more than €512, no advance VAT notifications or VAT returns are to be made.
A resulting VAT debt must be paid 10 days after the expiry of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to obtain a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT declarations, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (surrender or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT advance notifications and the corresponding payments may be made one month later, but in the case of monthly notifications a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT debt established for the pre-registration period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance notification.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance application, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the tax payer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was issued.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of reckless tax reduction or tax evasion.
The tax payers must submit the VAT advance notifications electronically.
The FÄ can grant exemptions to this rule in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
The annual VAT return can be issued either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the tax payer must additionally make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no advance VAT declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax payer.
In the event of a late levy, the tax payer can be charged a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax debt or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier audit, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not levy this late surcharge.
In the cases where the FÄ levied the late surcharges, the amount was set inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The late surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when submitting the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value indications for intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for obtaining services.
Non-taxable transactions must be indicated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated staff.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are directly available to the tax administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is collected electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain benchmarks.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the competent person on the basis of the automatically produced test notes (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the expiry of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the tax payer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, the tax payers must submit their advance applications at the latest 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax debt of the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be issued by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The requirement to issue an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax payer may correct the errors in the monthly advance notifications by submitting a single VAT return;
- If the tax payer corrects its information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax payers until the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return irrespective of the amount of their turnover.
This levy will enable the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the competent FA may compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only check the amount of the turnover on the basis of the income tax return issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax payers are leased to the electronic levy of the VAT advance registration.
The introduction of the requirement for electronic filing of the tax return in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary notifications
Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of § 102 of Law No 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur supplying goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State must submit corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the goods delivered is always indicated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the USt-IdNr7, the individual tax authorities under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The tax payers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must surrender the ZM to the local FA at the latest on the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a corrective ZM within 15 days of the detection of the error.
Erroneous data in the ZM will always be replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, the tax payers can also hand over the ZM electronically.
In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the financial officer shall be entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with § 37 of Law No 337 / 1992.
In its investigation, the NKÚ found that the FÄ usually did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax payers.
In particular, in the case of the levy of the ZM, the tax payers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to levy a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT debt.
In accordance with § 102 (5) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is required to check the information in the ZM or Amending ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which The tax payer corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a corrective ZM either on its own initiative or on request.
The financial officer must correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the tax authority does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or Amending ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting an Amending ZM;
- the financial officer has demonstrated the incorrectness of the information reported by the tax officer in the ZM or corrective ZM.
Appointments entered by the tax official, without a corrective ZM being issued by the tax office, do not replace the tax payer's pledge to issue a corrective ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the CMs will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the "O _ MCTL" message is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr., which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect USt-IdNr. is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is entered in the list of the wrong USt-IdNr.
The list contains a "message of doubts regarding USt-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
In the case of the purchase of goods from another Member State, the tax payer must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the relevant lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisitions made by the Czech tax authority in its VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods indicated by the supplier from the other Member State in its ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The staff there must investigate the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
(a) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the correctness of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation may result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax payer in the meantime makes a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax official to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
(c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech tax office in its VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods delivered by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is at the discretion of the financial official to verify the accuracy of the information.
After verifying the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer enters the results of his review in ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 in Figure 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error of the tax payer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the ZM are indicated differently in the different EC Member States.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FÄ can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary notifications in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must surrender on a quarterly basis ZM in which intra-Community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of the VAT advance notifications, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be submitted to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been levied.
The competent FA can allow exemptions for individual tax payers in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
If the tax payer finds that the ZM was faulty, it is leased to issue a corrective ZM within a month.
In the event of non-surrender of the ZM, the CLO initiates a forced procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first recollection - second recollection, combined with the threat of a penalty payment and - fixing the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets fines of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 of the UStG stipulates that the tax payer acts unlawfully if he intentionally or recklessly does not surrender a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This infringement can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ in the MIAS, because the processing of the ZM is exclusively the responsibility of the CLO.
The data of the ZM is stored only at the CLO.
The information from the summary notifications will only be available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the respective calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID numbers in the ZM of German tax authorities, the German CLO will receive a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO does not succeed in obtaining the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the right information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID number at the request of the CLO.
However, it takes too much time to remember, as well as to threaten and impose up to three consecutive fines if a tax payer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were ultimately reported to the competent FÄ, were usually closed within one to two months.
The competent IAs refused to grant tax exemptions for notified intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.
If the tax payer provided the correct VAT ID, the FA asked him to hand over a corrected ZM to the CLO because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the levy of the corrected ZM.
Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information given in the VAT declarations or the VAT return with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ, which is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT Items will be detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of labour tax in the FÄ.
Once they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be drawn up and sent to the competent FÄ.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas an auction of the acquisition data of all sales tax payers is later drawn up and forwarded to the FÄ.
The Risk Management System (RMS) for the investment procedure then compares these data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must surrender a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
In the case of FÄ, the values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax authorities in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the tax setting.
In Germany, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are leased to surrender quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the tax authorities in the ZM only indicate the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not indicated in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the given ZM itself.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect USt-ID was not corrected even if the tax payer informed the FA of the correct USt-ID number.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries that German tax payers make in their VAT advance declarations with the information of the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German CLO transfers the MIAS data to other Member States.
On the basis of these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
The data transmitted by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech tax authorities will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods indicated by the Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of derogations will be referred to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control will only be carried out in the case of tax payers who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax payers if the RMS produces an audit certificate or the tax payer has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the FÄ of the clarification of the reasons for the differences that arise.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax payers had to surrender monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only slightly increase the bureaucratic burden, as most tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already leased to submit monthly VAT returns or advance notifications and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or advance notifications.
In order to avoid red tape, the levy of the ZM could be linked to the submission of the VAT declarations or advance notifications.
However, a default on the monthly levy of ZM would create more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community acquisitions, and would increase the flow of data between the CLO.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the monthly levy of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree at European level on the single monthly levy, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is set out in Table 2.
Both auditors requested data on the number of false tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL notifications, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.
This data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
Whereas the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax payers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic forms of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by means of a request for information RFI using the standardized SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their replies to a received RFI through the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which is responsible for translating the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and for forwarding it to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the replies to requests sent, and takes care of their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period, while a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and 19 cases had not yet received a reply from Germany (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information on the basis of the information provided).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Graphic No. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The chart above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information, without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the various Member States will take place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another Member State, without its prior request, as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States about deliveries of new vehicles by means of automatic exchange of information.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the form of notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of Law No. 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the relevant document and passes it directly on to the responsible staff of the Finance Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and potential "missing traders."
This information will be transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.
The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC preprint used is one-language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the Federal Republic of Germany were sent in order to ensure the taxation of labour in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it examines whether the value of the deliveries referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO takes care of the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC preprint [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are neither written in German nor in English.
In order to answer the request for information, the CLO directs it to the competent FA and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ to respond to the uncompleted requests for information.
The FÄ will receive the necessary information by writing to the tax office or carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all tax-related transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
In this short and existential form of audit, an announcement to the tax payer is not necessary and it has proved its worth in investigating a single turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany will transmit to the other Member State the following information: - via VAT ID number allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of VAT to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has agreed to provide the following information to the other EC Member States in the context of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. Delivery of new vehicles to traders without VAT No., b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the acquisitions reported by a tax payer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods which have been incorrectly subject to taxation in Germany by the tax payer, e. potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, irrespective of whether their use of the tax code is still valid or has already been deleted.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent FÄ, which transmit the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.
Whereas the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information given into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany for the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that 74.5% of requests for information received by the Czech financial administration were completed within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were only dealt with by the German financial administration in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO points the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of temporary answers to requests for information.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous remembrance procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of turnover tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Sales Tax Methodology and Economic Management Department, or its Risk Management Unit, deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates risky goods, prepares the concept of risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and planning of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Audit and Tax Investigation Methodology Department carries out, among other things, risk analyses in the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the planning of the work of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, draws up risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Its tasks include the search for tax authorities and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, the pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax payers (e.g. in the Internet services, employment agencies, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of chain fraud cases and the information to local tax authorities.
Special exam units have been set up in 12 selected FÄ.
They have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorization, carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax payers with certain activities, multinational companies and tax payers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "Credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk of tax returns issued; - the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited," selecting the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAS," which allows financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task allows, among other things: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of tax payers from other Member States; - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax payer as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax payer in question from other Member States; - compilation of a list of tax payers who have not surrendered a ZM; - formal control of the information provided by tax payers in the Czech Republic in their Member States before such information is transmitted to other Member States; - compilation of a list of tax payers whose VAT declarations do not correspond to the VAT declarations in the other Member States; - compilation of a list of tax payers whose VAT declarations do not correspond to the VAT declarations in the CM of all other Member States.
As part of their role in the fight against tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, business registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 of Submission and Processing of Summary Notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
It is true that there are joint development working groups, but neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete set of data.
At the level of the CLO, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Centre for Special Value Added Tax Audit and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS, where the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the KUSS is brought into the development of the RMS through its cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT numbers of other Member States, which appear in the ZM of German tax authorities, will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT ID number referred to in the ZM is verified on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID number, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the discovery of suspected missing traders, using certain characteristics that usually occur in carousel transactions.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these notifications and must forward the result of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH's audit confirmed that all available features must be taken into account in order to be sufficiently likely to conclude a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the industry or the company's shareholdings.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT advance notifications and annual declarations.
For example, the system compiles a list of those tax payers who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT declaration or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete surrender of the ZM.
In addition, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions indicated by the tax payer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- Supplier and purchaser assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community transactions;
- different accounting records and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner / shareholder, number of employees and method of payment of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a rule-based risk management system that allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program its own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are identified.
This system is used in the processing of VAT notifications by the FÄ.
As a result, the competent FA receives the information from the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.
On the basis of this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FÄ will decide on the examination of the tax plans in question.
After the audit, the auditors will have to report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on many data from processed VAT returns and some other evidence, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the datamining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax payer is involved in tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the relevant tax breakers for examination and report the audit results to the data center concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems to be a good idea.
Whether the hoped-for effects will materialize during actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in the present report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be a European problem, not a national one.
The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State; if this does not happen, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel audits, NKÚ and BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and / or deliveries.
acquisitions which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two jurisdictions jointly examined the handling of several deliveries about which there were doubts about the implementation, or which the tax authorities of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight business incidents between eight Czech and eight German tax payers.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of communications from the BRH, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax authorities had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax payers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
Examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems identified in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €60,500 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech tax payer declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany for verification of the value of the goods delivered.
In response to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and goods worth €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
However, the German CLO had accepted a further application from the German tax authority and brought forward the validity of the USt-IdNr. retroactively as of May 1, 2004.
The German tax payer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax authorities.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech tax payer had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (lower) tax periods during which it declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time requested the deduction of VAT from acquisitions from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent representative of the Czech Tax Office could not clearly determine whether the declared acquisitions also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as a sales tax issuer in September 2003.
At the time of registration, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number valid exclusively for Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to retroactively allocate a VAT ID number to a tax payer, in 2006 the responsible person of the German financial administration did so retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO retroactively allocates a USt-ID number if the German entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the tax payer applied for a USt-ID number.
In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. retroactively, because according to § 6 of the UStG the entrepreneur does not need a valid USt-IdNr. for an intra-Community delivery.
Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID of its supplier in order to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
In view of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted the VAT ID number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for a review of the German entrepreneur's turnover tax registration.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities announced that the German tax payer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons had only been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany on 16 February 2005.
Through a request from the local Czech finance official, the NKÚ learned that the financial officer had carried out a VAT audit at the Czech tax office for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this investigation, the tax office found that the Czech tax payer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German tax payer before his sales tax registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office set a tax debt of CZK 1,880 against the Czech tax payer for the third quarter of 2004.
In response to the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German tax payer had only been allocated the VAT ID number when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for sales tax purposes in order to be able to monitor the delivery of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the tax payer stated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160 €(approx. 5,000 CZK).
3. In its sales tax return for September 2004 as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer stated correct deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax payer.
When verifying the registration of the German tax payer in the MIAS system, the Czech financial official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the deliveries of goods to Germany.
The Czech tax payer issued a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer subsequently submitted an application for the resumption of the tax procedure with regard to the supplementary VAT return, as proof that the German tax payer had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech finance official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax payer in the context of the international exchange of information.
The German information showed that the German tax payer had only been assigned a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech finance official rejected the request to resume the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German tax payer had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the turnover tax on this and also demanded the reimbursement of the same amount of advance taxes.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax debt of the German tax payer, the German financial official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
The BRH also found that the company of the German tax payer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, leading to confusion between two German tax payers.
This change in the name of the German tax payer also confused the Czech financial official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax payer from a German tax payer worth €22,686.
In a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, as part of an external audit, the Czech tax official had checked with the Czech tax payer whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax payer had recorded and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax payer did not explain the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice but only his tax number intended for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax payer will not be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax payers.
The Czech financial official also requested that the German financial administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax payer so that he could initiate an appropriate tax procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a VAT on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a tax payer supplying goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to benefit from the VAT exemption for such a supply.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.
In this case, under German tax law, the turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to occupational taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech finance official took note of this business incident, because the supply of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of €15,000:5.
According to MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €12,561 from a German tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech financial official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the context of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this supply of goods by means of a SAC-form.
The Czech tax payer said he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech financial official did not receive any documents for the subsequent taxation of the goods acquired, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax fixing was in place.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German tax payer acted as a "fiscal representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax payer explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the Federal Republic of Germany, the German FA will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods.
In Section 4.6.1 it was shown that the replies of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the replies of the Czech financial administration:
6. During its investigation, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of Wa-rene deliveries to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax payer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax payer declared in its VAT return only the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side indicated that the request for information could not be processed as the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using a SCAC form, requested a review of a delivery of motor vehicles in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to a German tax payer worth €1,265,554, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ found that at the time of its examination, a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request to the local finance official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not declared in its VAT return the supply of new vehicles to these German tax payers worth CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech financial official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax official issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the Federal Republic of Germany, a special VAT audit was carried out by the German purchaser in Germany, which found that the purchase of all the vehicles concerned had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold on to other tax authorities in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer acquired a car worth €48,500 from a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not issued a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax payer did not make any tax returns even at the request of the tax official, as a result of which the FA set the VAT debt at zero for the period October to December 2004 on 23 May 2005.
On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an order to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German tax payer.
Since the Czech tax payer did not cooperate with the financial official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the NKÚ audit how the Czech financial official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-fulfilment of the requirements of the Czech VAT law, the VAT registration of the Czech tax payer was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial word was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his response to the request for information, the German finance official said that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in his VAT advance notifications for the months August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, indicating carousel fraud.
The German financial administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax payer had acquired several motor vehicles and that, moreover, the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits at the Czech tax office to check the deduction of above-average pre-taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax payer had declared in its VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 for the period in question, and that the examination of the German FA with the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
The cases examined showed that periodic inconsistencies or incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, the Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €35,716 from the German tax payer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech tax payer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech tax payer did not cooperate with the financial official and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech financial official asked for a review of how the German tax payer had communicated with the Czech one as part of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech tax payer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax payer only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax payer sent the German tax payer a false payment confirmation of the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax payer.
After uncovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax payer, with the support of its other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
In a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received to the Czech tax authority, the financial administration subsequently taxed the turnover of goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €7,916.
In accordance with German law, the German tax payer declared the withdrawal of the supply and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCAC form.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax payer had delivered goods worth a total of €396,126 to the German tax payer and provided services worth €11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit of the Czech tax payer in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax payer had supplied and assembled a production plant to the German one.
The Czech tax authority supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax payer did not take off the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax payer charged the German production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax payer received the bills, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices had been duly recorded in the books of the Czech tax office.
The sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax authorities and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech financial administration, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax payer to the German one, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of fulfilment of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German service recipient of the factory delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German sales tax law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
Since the VAT liability of the German tax payer remained unchanged, the German FA did not cause a correction of the VAT return.
13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax payer A acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax payer C in February 2005.
The Czech finance official sent a request to Germany for this information to be reviewed.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax payer C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax payer B in 2004, but that it had returned it to the German tax payer C in October 2004.
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax payer C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it also emerged that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the branch of the German tax payer in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
In a request to the local tax official responsible for the tax payer B, the NKÚ found that, according to MIAS data, the German tax payer C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
The tax payer B said it had not received this goods, so the local Czech finance official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations at the tax payer B, the financial official found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been recorded at the tax payer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German tax payer C had delivered to the Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the Czech financial official responsible for the tax break A had carried out an audit on it.
The finance official had the invoice of the German tax payer C of 7 February 2005, in which the tax payer A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech financial official noted that the tax payer A had not recorded this bill.
The tax payer A had entered into a leasing contract with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company rma delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in response to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the tax payer A.
The BRH found that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine worth €88,027 not to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax payer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-bound delivery within Germany.
As a result, the German financial official did not recognise the German tax and tax C's claim to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German tax payer D delivered the machine to the Czech tax payer B.
According to German law, this delivery was not tax-free in Germany, but was subject to sales tax in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that the German tax payer C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax payer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The following figure illustrates the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
During the examination of requests for information received, the NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German financial official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German financial official said there was a suspicion that this was an intra-Community supply of goods.
The German tax payer has not carried out an active business activity since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax payer.
The head of the Czech company said this was probably a claim by the German tax payer against the German financial administration, which the Czech tax payer had asserted to the German FA as a shareholder in the German company.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech finance official has so far had no information that the German financial administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax payer.
It is clear from the information available that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax payer.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the beneficiaries (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer supplied a Czech tax payer with a total value of €33,205 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech financial official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its response to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax payer, and that the other goods had been picked up in person.
By enquiry from the local Czech Fi- nanzOfficials, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the value of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech finance official recommended a tax audit at the Czech tax office.
This examination has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax payer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech tax payer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for a verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent indicating a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax office and the MIAS data.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax office and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk to the company owner about the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary VAT return has been issued.
The Czech financial official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT fixing for the tax period in question would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax payer delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax payer.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial official asked for a review of whether the aforementioned Czech tax payers actually existed, as the alleged capital owner of the German tax payer had set up a number of bogus rents in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax payer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax office, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax payer submitted evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax payer was not registered as a sales tax payer in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech finance official forwarded this information to the German financial administration in his response to the request for information.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of a tax audit, the Czech tax payer had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax payer and at the same time asserted the right to deduct VAT for the purchase from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not report any sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return, which had been issued after the external audit, the Czech financial official fixed the VAT debt unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported to the Czech Republic by another Member State.
As a result, the Czech financial official drew the wrong conclusion in the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax payer and demanded the payment of sales tax worth €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of these goods is duly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German financial administration on the question of whether the Czech tax payer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax payer as an annex.
As a further installation, a photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was attached.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech finance official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and said she had no contacts with a German tax payer.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech finance official responded to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By asking the local Czech finance official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not reachable.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax official set the tax debt of the Czech tax payer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial official had rejected the German tax payer's claim to exempt this delivery from sales tax on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax payer was supposed to have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax office did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German financial official asked for the verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax payer issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely that shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech tax payer informed the financial official that the capital owner had deposited the payment received in euros for the goods invoiced into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By request to the local competent Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the financial official had recognised the Czech tax official's right to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States amounting to CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German financial official did not correct the German acquirer's VAT return, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax payer.
Since the previous external audit showed no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to levy a fixed VAT debt.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German tax payer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in its 2004 VAT return or in the for 2005.
In addition, he did not declare any starting sales in terms of value.
Due to these inconsistencies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery notified by the Czech tax authorities had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech Finance Administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
The documents handed over to the NKÚ by the competent financial officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax office, a protocol on the commencement of the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005 had been drawn up on 30 March 2006.
At the same time, the tax officer was asked by the tax official to provide all accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.
The Czech tax payer has not issued any sales tax returns since April 2006.
In the context of the parallel investigation, NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two auditors exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do tax-related business in Germany.
On the basis of this information, the company was registered in June 2005, but did not receive a German USt-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production and delivery of wind turbines to Austria on behalf, at the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax payer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for assembly on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
Because the forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out on its own behalf, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the supply of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the supply was intended is different from the home country of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM issued to the German CLO.
As a result, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not notify intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion in this case.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case formulations in order to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation of 2004.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for the tax payers and the FÄ to apply the new legislation:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax payer.
During the same period, another Czech tax payer in its ZM reported intra-Community deliveries to another German tax payer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that both were electricity supplies.
Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 there were different legal provisions on the supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the deliveries of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legislation in the Czech Republic were eliminated by the adoption of Law No 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax payer in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 declared intra-Community deliveries to a German tax payer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax payer in his ZM for the same period declared intra-Community deliveries to another German tax payer with a value of CZK 263,470,776.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases they were supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No 235 / 2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005 onwards, the place of performance in the case of the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, place of business or place of business for which such delivery takes place.
Therefore, the Czech tax authorities should not have indicated the electricity deliveries in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both tax authorities treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Final remark
The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing the administration of VAT.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions were revealed.
For some of them, further observation is worthwhile.
On the basis of the audit results, both auditors drew up recommendations on the management of the turnover tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a verification exercise should be part of further monitoring.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two auditors will form the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the area of VAT management.
