Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of the sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasizes that the financial institutions are empowered to examine the entire public finances.
The Declaration requires that the audit have to have the power to examine the tax collection as largely as possible.
The Organisation of the European Supreme Court (Eurosai) considers taxes as an important part of public revenue.
The Thematic Focus of the vi. Eurosai Congress, which took place in bonn in 2005, was the examination of public revenue by the audit.
One of the most important steps on the way to optimize the financial management of a court of auditors is the development of a special strategy for the examination of public revenue
This is especially the case for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of risk.
Since National economies are increasingly linked and dependent on each other, there may be a situation in which national audit can perceive their audit only in cooperation with the audit of other states.
As an example, the test of international fraud fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant environmental problems in many states.
The cooperation between the authorities is required in the fight against such crimes.
Audit, who are checking in this area, must be ready to work closely together.
The idea of an audit of the vat and the system mias is at vi. Eurosai Congress in bonn was created. This examination was carried out in cooperation between the court of auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Ministry of
In The course of a thorough preparation, the interested parties had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the vat administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Due to the evaluation of the information available, we took the selection of the exam items for the audit.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC member states) are looking for solutions to improve the system, to simplify the levying of VAT and to create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only contribute to the improvement of the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of the sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Document Number: CZ) 06/27 (en) VIII 2-2005
Exam Item:
(CZ) Administration of vat after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(en) Review of the cooperation of administrative authorities in the field of vat in accordance with regulation (EC) no. 1798/2003 of the council and 1925/2004
The Commission Audit Goal:
(CZ) the objective of the test in the Czech Republic was an examination of the procedures applied by the financial management in the field of VAT, after the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European community (Hereinafter "EC") with free goods and services and the use of the mias1, in particular the control of the use of the turnover tax exemption for intra-community
(de) the aim of the audit was to investigate the system of intra-community vat on VAT, focusing on the mutual assistance in the field of vat in accordance with the above
As a result of the test, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations for their fixing should be made.
VAT information exchange system the tests were carried out by the court of auditors of the Czech Republic (" nku ") and the federal court of auditors (" BRH ") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of a agreement concluded on 8. June 2006
The main focus of the cooperation was the review of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained by international mutual assistance between the, and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two
A Joint Final report on the results of the tests was carried out in the sense of European Guideline No. 31 created for the implementation of intosai-standards.
The verified period included the period from 1. May 2004 to 31. December 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel exam
The Parallel examination of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two audit.
In addition to the focus on "Information Exchange" in accordance with regulation (EC) no. 1798/2003 of the council and 1925/2004 of the commission, other closely related aspects were examined, for example the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.
In addition, the test also extended to the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport with buses and to the comparison of statistical data.
Differences in the following areas were found when comparing the systems of turnover tax administrations in the two states:
1) registration for the purposes of VAT.
While in Germany the entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, besides others, the essential criterion for registration is the overrun of the minimum prices fixed in the legislation.
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons receive only one single payment card, which they also use for intra-community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number only applicable for domestic transactions for the purposes of VAT.
If the German taxable person wants to make intra-community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called UST-Idnr.
Since the different registration procedures have problems, the rules should be unified within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport with buses.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport with buses is free, but there is a claim for deduction of VAT.
In Germany, the transport of transport is the as far as the route through Germany is leading.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with article 393 of council directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).
3) tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic, taxable persons have to pay only for tax-free tax periods (month or quarter), taxable persons have in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Sales of VAT and to make a sales declaration after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxable persons in Germany have to make the vat of by electronic means.
The Introduction of the obligation to provide the electronic charge of turnover in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of Czech financial management (see 4.3).
4) summary stories.
While taxable persons in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the offices (Fä), German taxable persons have the summary notifications in the case of the clo2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary reports in the Czech Republic is available immediately after their submission.
German fä, the information from the summary reports is only available after their processing by the clo.
In order to combat the turnover tax, updated information on intra-community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the update of the Mia data.
This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the member state of the acquirer (see 4.4), but only when all EC member states introduce the same deadlines.
5) International Exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In the case of incoming request for information, Czech clo monitors compliance with the months.
The German clo does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has done a significantly lower percentage of the request for information within the specified deadline
Due to these problems, the brh recommended to German clo a constant monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk Management.
Each of the two member states will be able to develop their own risk (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The nku and the brh point out that an effective rms can not be developed by a member state alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of a rms must be exchanged and implemented in all EC member states. Otherwise, scammers will choose the member state with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
In the framework of the cooperation, the two audit examined selected cases of intra-community transactions realized between Czech and German tax authorities.
Of this, 31 cases were checked together by using the legal possibilities of clo, where there was doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of turnover.
The audit have found the following:
In some cases, the fä used the information gained in the international information exchange and re-established the vat liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In these cases, the taxable persons had either illegally claimed the turnover tax exemption or did not identify the acquisition of goods in their vat declaration.
In some cases, the fä could not use the information gained in the information exchange because they were incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal regulations in the two member states.
In some cases, the financial management of another member state refused to provide information.
Some cases have been uncovered in which taxable persons in their summary notifications are not in the wrong position.
In the result, the data in mias were accordingly flawed, so that the clerks (the fä) had to determine in these cases (SEE 6).

An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least 2.000.000 czk in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as a predisposition period and has to inform the now of this change.
The granting of a tax number in the registration is always a must-have character.
The taxable person has to indicate the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the payment code, also in cases where a special law imposes this (e.g. law no. 235/2004, concerning the copy of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic in the form of a general identiﬁzierungszeichens.
For Natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general law, as far as a special law determines this. For Legal persons, the general identifiers is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of law no. 33). 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite the request of the now, the local competent, has to register him from his office.
There is also a call to the taxable person.
In the Czech Republic, each entrepreneurs authorised for business will receive a tax number for any type of business in their first registration.
This also applies to registration as turnover tax payer.

The Payment of the amount so fixed is considered to be a taxes within the meaning of § 98 (3) of law no 235/2004, that is, it is not a fine or punishment.
If the legal requirements are available, registration of a vat can be deleted for two reasons:

A taxable person may apply for the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force in the registration.
2) deletion of the registration of the office (§ 106 (7) of law no. 2) 235/2004), if: a) the taxable person did not provide performance during the period of 12 consecutive months and did not inform the taxable person about the reasons for that, b) the taxable person his obligations according to law no. 235/2004 did not fulfil, c) the previous taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for the tax liability.

Delivery of a tax declaration and to pay taxes ("Non-established entrepreneurs") will be taxable with the provision of the performance in question.
It Must submit an application for registration at the fa Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery concerned.
He is to, in this application, all VAT-idnr allocated to him in other member states or third countries. Specify.
If a non-established entrepreneur asks for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service in the Czech Republic, the fa Prague 1 has to be registered retroactively as it is in accordance with law no. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable service in the Czech Republic.
In the case of a retrospective registration, the fa Prague 1 has to demand from the entrepreneurs concerned a receipt (invoices or written explanations) for the proof of performance.
If a non-established entrepreneur asks for registration in the Czech Republic before the initial execution of a performance, the fa Prague 1 has to ask for the presentation of the performance certificates.
On 31. December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered at the fa Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. On 31. December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of law no. In 235/2004, the, is empowered to delete the registration of a non-Resident Entrepreneur on 31. January of the follow-up calendar, if this is the obligation to charge tax registrations or.-explanations and not accepted for the taxes.
In the examination of the tax declaration, it was found that in the case of a tax declaration by post with dispatch abroad on 25. January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for the tax declaration, this declaration is not yet available until 31. January at the fa has been received.
In those cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of deletion of registration, will be known to the fa later than on 31. January, a deletion of the registration of the non-Resident Entrepreneur for vat in the Czech Republic in the no longer possible in the relevant calendar year.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax declaration (§§ 137, 138 AO), any business operation must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration shall be carried out at the latest one month after the start of the business.
The Municipality continues the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has been recorded but has not been registered, the taxable person may also register retroactively.
In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-Resident, are registered for registration for sales of vat on VAT, if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German Federal Tax Office (Ustg).
This does not depend on the height of the turnover achieved.
A voluntary registration is not available in Germany.
For Entrepreneurs Resident Abroad, special training courses are responsible.
For example, for those entrepreneurs who have their seat in the Czech Republic, the fa chemnitz south is responsible.
On 30. April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs registered for these goods; 1.050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there on 1. March 2006
According to the brh, these fä with special responsibilities denied the registration of so-called self-employed persons with residence in the new means or. Eastern European member states of the EC.
Since, after the EC Accession of these ten states, the freedom of movement of workers is still limited, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own
These self-employed persons do not fulfil the requirements for recognition as an entrepreneur in § 2 Ustg, as they are usually from a single client. Gig, which determines their working hours and the type of work.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire of the competent fa and make information about the company and the business carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all fä in Germany.
It will be processed either in special of within the fä or in the general of responsible for the of.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment for the individual taxable person will be carried out before the allocation of
The construction of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent fa, the following three (or four) digits show which department is responsible within the fa, the following five (or four) digits are the minimum number for the taxable person, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-community trade, he needs a VAT payment system in order to make tax-FREE INTRA-community deliveries.
This is assigned by clo on request when the entrepreneur in Germany is registered for umsatzsteuerliche purposes.
The UST-Idnr. Will be automatically allocated by clo when the taxable person declares intra-community deliveries in his vat of or in his vat year declaration.
The UST-Idnr. is composed of the country code (de) and an episode of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On Request (for example when he hires the business), but only after the execution of all taxation operations (assessment of all financial years) or 2. When the financial management finds that he does not operate any business anymore.
Usually, the validity of the vat idnr depends. from the validity of the v.a.t.
In these cases, the fä have to teach the clo about the deletion of the v.a.t, so that there is the validity of the ust-Idnr. Can be finished at this time.
According to legislation (§ 19 (1) Ustg), domestic taxable persons do not have to pay vat in the following cases: 1. The Turnover of the previous calendar year plus the sales tax incurred has not exceeded the amount of 17.500 € and 2. Will probably not exceed the amount of 50.000 € in the following year.
The So-called small businesses are not entitled to invoice vat to other entrepreneurs, as well as to the deduction of VAT.
Although you do not have to pay a turnover tax, small businesses are to to register at the IRS and make an annual sales tax declaration.
A small business can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) Ustg.
This explanation is binding for the following five years.
He may then invoice the vat and deduct the VAT.
Non-resident taxable persons can appoint a federal prosecutor (§ 22 a ustg).
The requirement is that they make exclusively tax-FREE TRANSACTIONS AND RENOUNCE THE DEDUCTION OF DEDUCTION.
The employee complies with the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that it does not have to be registered for the purposes of VAT.
In the invoices, it is indicated that a employee has been ordered.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, the Czech Republic is the first requirement for registration (next to others) to exceed the threshold amount mentioned in the legislation.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he will be able to register voluntarily.
The registration process in Germany is standardized, but there may be differences due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who is registered for non-profit purposes receives a tax number exclusively for non-profit transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-community transactions, he must specifically allocate a VAT payment card. Request.
Both the nku and the brh found that the German two-digit registration system can lead to significant misunderstandings in other member states such as the Czech Republic, which gives a single identification number both for national registration for vat as well as for intra-community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-factor system allows a retrospective (National Registration) in cases where the taxable person does not register his business activity with the municipality or the competent fa.
This retrospective registration allows for a correct assessment of vat for previous periods of assessment, in particular a precise estimate of the VAT fault.
Since the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be unified.
The German Parliament has recently decided to introduce a federal government.
This is supposed to be allocated by the bundeszentralamt for taxes of every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons living in Germany for life.
If a natural person participates in a business activity, the competent fa requests a commercial payment service, which is as a VAT payment card. Serves.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of ust-Idnr. Give.
The work on the implementation of an it procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport with bus
The statutory regulations in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of § 70 of law no. In 235/2004, since 1. May 2004, the transport of passengers between the individual member states and between the member states and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT and there is a claim for deduction of VAT.
The exemption from VAT is also valid when the transport of persons registered in other member states as taxable persons or by foreigners who are taxable in the domestic market are carried out.
The return journey is considered a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not practice any other economic activity than the cross-border passenger transport with buses, they are not allowed to register in the Czech Republic as a public transport service.
Cross-border passenger transport was in the Czech Republic due to the law on the accession of the Czech Republic Appendix No. V, Chapter 5 (1) (b) excluded from the VAT. The cited position is in the wording:
" for the purpose of applying article 28 (3) (b) of directive 77/388 / EEC, the Czech Republic May, in accordance with point 17 of annex f to the directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either as long as until the requirement of article 28 (4) of the directive is fulfilled or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current member states."
The statutory regulations in Germany
In accordance with article 46 of council directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006, as it has been implemented in Germany by § 3 B (1) Ustg, a transport is carried out there, where the transport will be carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between a domestic and a cross-border passenger transport.
Only the part of the transport that is attributable to the domestic market is taxable in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-Resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person is transported by Germany, the part of the transport in Germany is considered as a taxable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-Resident Entrepreneur has to report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent fa.
This register him for tax purposes (Comparisons 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for everyone in the registration of the taxable person.
The Entrepreneur has to indicate his taxable transport in a German sales tax declaration.
On March 1., 2006, the Czech Republic was registered at the fa chemnitz-South.
If the transport costs are provided for a resident resident in the country, the non-resident taxable person does not have to pay the vat to the fa himself.
At its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the vat to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxable persons. This process is called "relocation of the liability" and is in line with article 196 of council directive 2006/112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxable person and its financial management, the German financial administration has several means to examine the correctness of the tax declaration regarding taxable persons:
Mobile control groups of the customs check the certificates of buses approved abroad, used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each test, the mobile control groups shall send an inspection protocol to the competent fa.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can ask for the payment of the vat from the bus driver before continuing his ride.
The Non-resident taxable person can deduct the vat so paid from the tax liability indicated in his vat declaration.
If the fa doubts about the correctness of a vat declaration, it may order an audit that has in the fa, or can be the one in regulation (EC) no. 1798/2003 of the council (see no. 1798/2003) 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxable person refuses the payment of the legally fixed VAT, the fa may request assistance in accordance with the council directive 76/308 / EEC.
The Brh considers this means of mutual assistance in tax to review the sales tax declaration or. Compliance with the tax liability by a non-resident insurance company as too elaborate in relation to the low revenue from the vat on taxable persons.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxable person causes disproportionately high costs for the taxable person and for the financial management.
The latter must check foreign books, for which not only the knowledge of the foreign language, but also the foreign accounting principles, is required.
Accordingly, in such a test, a higher time is expected than a resident taxable person, although the examination is limited to the persons taking part in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxable person does not only have to accept the powers of his national financial management, but also those of the other member states,
In addition, the taxable person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the different languages and on the forms of the, of the EC member states concerned for each member state, in which only one single passenger transport is carried out.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC member states and between the member states and third countries is exempt from vat on the basis of the law on the EC Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, transport is in line with the transport route on German territory.
If a non-resident taxable person provides such a transport for the first time, he has to register before the competent fa.
This register the taxable person who has to declare the taxable proportion of the transport in a tax declaration in Germany.
The enforcement in Germany is very time consuming.
At least three of four Czech taxable persons registered at the fa chemnitz-South have the passenger transport as a business.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
The member states - which raise vat in accordance with article 46 of council directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006 on the common agricultural policy - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high costs of the assessment of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one member state.
This could be the state in which the promotion begins or in which the service provider is resident.
Such a kind of taxation would call for a change to council directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006
Turnover
Charge and processing of turnover in the Czech Republic
In so far as the law does not determine anything else, the entrepreneur is, even if no tax liability has been created, for the delivery of a vat declaration on the form specified by the ministry of finance within 25 days after the end of the
The tax liability arises with the expiry of the time limit for the tax declaration. Except for this regulation, the vat on the importation of goods is, according to law no. 235/2004 here is the maturity of the tax according to customs regulations.
If there is an average amount of high-quality deductible in a row, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the fixing of this deduction, without the need to create an application.
The deadline shall not be applied in cases where the payment service launches a procedural procedure regarding the tax liability of the taxable person.
According to § 73 (11) of law no. In 235/2004, the claim for deduction can be claimed at the latest with the regular tax declaration for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim for deduction of deduction has been created
After the end of this period, the deduction may be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, the submission of a supplementary tax declaration is required.
A Amendment of law no. 1., which came into force on 1. January 2005 235/2004 allows the delivery of a supplementary vat declaration only for the period in which the claim for deduction could have been claimed for the first time.
A taxable person must make a supplementary vat declaration if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes adjustments, which will not change the last known tax liability, but will be changed only previous information, c) he according to § 49 of law no. 235/2004 adjustments to the tax and the tax liability.
A taxable person may make a supplementary vat declaration if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxable person must make the supplementary tax declaration until the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question have been identified.
The Umsa tax declaration can be made electronically by internet or by media.
The charge via internet can be made with a certified electronic signature or without these.
If it takes place without electronic signature, it must be submitted in addition to data media.
The form for the vat declaration contains separate lines for the indication of the value of intra-community deliveries and acquisitions.
The Value-related services must be indicated in separate lines of the sales tax declaration.
Some headings are used for automated primary checks under the atis system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC member states to those registered as taxable persons is compared with the data indicated by the Czech taxable persons in their summary reports.
The value of the purchases of goods from other member states from those registered as taxable persons is compared with the information provided by the mias with the information in the summary reports of the taxable persons from other EC member states.
As part of the atis system, the fa will perform a credibility test of the turnover.
This is automatically done because the vat declaration can not be processed without the previous test.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of the turnover.
In accordance with the provisions of § 37 (1) of law no. In 337/1992, the fa can repeatedly impose a fine of up to 2 million czk against people who do not comply with their obligations under this or a special tax act or a decision in accordance with this law.
Automated Tax Information System - Automated Steuerin Information System, which is used by the Czech government to provide technical support for tax revenue.
At its audit, the nku found that the fä rarely used the possibility of imposing a fine against the taxable person in the case of not imposing the vat declaration.
Charge and processing of turnover in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly vat rates and the annual sales tax declaration.
Those taxable persons who are in charge of tax-free sales of vat are still required to make an annual vat declaration.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not in order to pay the vat will have to make an annual vat declaration.
The taxable persons are in principle ready to make a vat pre-registration until the 10. th day after the end of the sales period in which the VAT is created (§ 18 (2) Ustg).
However, if the vat debt was more than 6.136 € in the previous year or if it is a newly company, the entrepreneur will be free to charge monthly sales taxes at the latest until the 10. th day after the end of the month in question.
The taxable person can also decide on the charge of monthly sales tax of if he received an amount over 6.136 € in the previous year (§ 18 (2 a) Ustg).
If the annual sales tax is not more than € 512, neither vat nor sales costs can be delivered.
A resulting vat fault is to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund may lead to a more cost-effective audit by the financial management.
(statutory) deadlines for the processing of turnover and for the refund of umsatzsteuerüberzahlungen do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund can be offered.
In Principle, payment cases, also refund cases, are to be processed quickly.
The German legislation allows for an extension of this (charge or service). Payment Deadlines (§ 18 (6) Ustg).
The Extension of the extension must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the charge of the sales tax and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment is to be provided.
This payment will be charged with the vat on vat established for the pre-registration period December.
If a mistake is discovered, the entrepreneur must make a corrected vat pre-registration.
A "complementary" VAT declaration does not exist.
If the vat declaration by 31. May of the following year is issued by the finanzamt, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect vat pre-registration, but only the incorrect annual sales tax declaration.
Corrections to this vat declaration on the pre-or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first vat declaration was issued.
After the end of this period, a vat declaration can normally only be corrected in cases of a tax evasion or tax evasion.
Taxable persons must submit the vat of by electronic means.
The fä may authorise exceptions from this rule to avoid hardening of the rigors.
The annual vat declaration can be issued both in paper form or via internet with or without course.
If the charge is without a minimum fee, the taxable person must make the statement in addition to paper and with his personal signature.
Will not be VAT-free or.-statements made, the financial management is entitled to a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person.
In Case of late delivery, the taxable person can be charged with a delay (up to 10 % of the tax liability or up to an amount of 25.000 €).
In an earlier exam, the brh found that the fä often do not raise this delay.
In the cases in which the fä raised the delay surcharges, the fixing of the amount was uneven and arbitrary.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose to reduce the average delay, especially when it comes to the annual vat declaration.
The form of the vat declaration contains separate lines for intra-community deliveries and deliveries. Acquire.
There are also separate lines for the reference of services.
Non-taxable transactions are to be indicated in a separate line of the vat declaration.
The documents submitted on paper must be collected electronically or by specially intended staff electronically.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
After all data is electronically registered, you will be subjected to a handedness and a case selection will be made using certain standards.
The so selected turnover must be checked by the competent clerk using the automatically created prüfhinweise (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration has to make only a rough estimate of the vat debt, it has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, the taxable persons have to submit their turnover at the latest 25 days after the end of the tax
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar or the calendar month.
In Germany, the taxable persons have to submit their payment fee according to the amount of their tax liability of the previous year at least 10 days after the end of the
The vat year declaration must be issued at the latest until 31. May of the following year.
The obligation to charge an annual vat declaration has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ after the end of the calendar year, the taxable person may correct the errors in the monthly payment period by giving a single vat declaration;
- if the taxable person corrects his information on intra-community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting room of the zm;
- the federal states of the same mias data on intra-community acquisitions of German taxable persons only when the vat year declarations have been normally processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3) German entrepreneurs have to make a vat declaration regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This taxes puts the German financial administration in a position to review the compliance of the turnover ceiling for small businesses.
In addition, the competent fa may match the vat year declaration with the corresponding explanations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the financial management may review the amount of turnover only on the basis of the payment costs.
In contrast to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German taxable persons are available for the electronic charge of the vat pre-registration.
The Introduction of the obligation to charge the tax declaration in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of Czech financial management.
Summary Stories
Delivery and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of § 102 of law no. In 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another member state for tax purposes has corresponding summary reports (Hereinafter "ZM").
The indication of the value of the goods delivered is always in Czech currency in the zm, broken down according to the vat rates of each taxable person, under which they are registered in the other member state.
Information about services is not made in the zm.
The taxable persons with a calendar or quarter of the tax period have to rehome the zm at the local competent fa at the latest on the 25. th day after the end of
Incorrect data shall be corrected in a correction zm within 15 days of the determination of the error.
Faulty data in the zm will always be replaced by the data from the correction zm.
Similar to the tax returns, taxable persons can also make the zm electronically.
A taxable person does not give a ZM OR CORRECTION ZM, although he is according to law no. 235/2004 to is, the, has to ask him to charge the zm concerned and to assign to the consequences of the non-Levy. If non-monetary obligations are non-Compliance, the, is empowered, according to § 37 of law no 337/1992 repeatedly impose fines up to an amount of 2 million czk.
In his audit, the nku found that the fä mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting taxable persons.
In particular when the zm is delivered, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their duties, because the failure of a zm does not affect the amount of their vat guilt.
According to § 102 (5) of law no. In 235/2004, the, to is to review the information in the zm or berichtigungszm, to eliminate all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In Non-compliance
8 of the information in the zm with which the taxable person corrects false information in the zm by giving a correction zm either from his own initiative or by request.
The, has to correct the data on goods to other member states in the system atis if:
- the taxable person does not demonstrate the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or correction zm) and therefore corrects them by levy a correction zm,
- the, has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM OR CORRECTION ZM.
Be entered by the now without a correction of the taxable person from the taxable person, does not replace the duty of the taxable person to charge a payment fee, but only lead to the correction of the data in the mias, so that they are currently, complete and accurate.
The data from the zm will be forwarded to the member states concerned.
Only the national tax office referred to in cooperation with the other member states in the field of sales tax may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is perceived by the department of international assistance in the field of vat in the ministry of finance). The message "O _ Mctl" will automatically receive the clo from the other member states.
It contains all the incorrect vat rates that have been indicated in the zm lines submitted.
Will be the incorrect ust-Idnr. Used in some of the submitted lines of the zm or the corrected zm, an entry is made in the list of false ust-Idnr.
The list contains a " message about doubts about VAT-idnr.".
The, checks the data and gives the result of the review in the system.
In the purchase of goods from another member state, the taxable person has to declare this in his vat declaration and enter the value of the acquisition in the certain lines of the vat declaration.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisitions made by the Czech taxable person in his vat declaration and the values for the purchase of the goods provided by the supplier from the other member state in his zm are forwarded by clo to the competent fa for testing.
The Clerks There have to investigate the deviations.
There can be three different situations:
(a) the value indicated by the Czech Acquirer in the relevant headings of its vat declaration is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC member states.
In this case, the, verifies the correctness of the information.
B) the difference is zero.
This situation can either be caused by a change in the data within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its zm) or by changing the information in the vat declaration (the Czech taxable person gives a supplementary vat declaration in the meantime from his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the now to review the correctness of the information in the vat declaration nevertheless.
(C) the value of the goods purchased from other member states, which the Czech taxable person has indicated in his vat declaration, is higher than the values of their goods reported by the suppliers of the other EC member states.
Here it is again at the discretion of the now to review the correctness of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for its appearance, the, gives the results of its review in atis.
These results will be forwarded to clo.
The number of operations carried out by the clo for testing is for the individual quarters of 2005 from graphic no. 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of finance) visible.
The above graph 1 shows that the number of cases submitted by clo has decreased the number of cases submitted for the individual quarters of 2005
The significant reduction in the number in the 4. TH QUARTER OF 2005 is based on the fact that czech clo has raised the threshold for a selection of cases, taking into account the minimum limit for a request for information to the other EC member
Differences between the data in the turnover and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on a mistake from the domestic acquirer.
There may also be a mistake of the taxable person in another member state or a mistake caused by the differences in the number of deliveries in the zm in the individual EC member states.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited transactions are shown in table 1
Delivery and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who from Germany make intra-community deliveries to other EC member states or participate in triangular must deliver quarterly zm, in which the intra-community deliveries are listed by Acquirer (§ 18 a (1) Ustg).
The Zm must be issued at the latest on the 10. th day of the month following the month of application.
If a payment fee is granted for the charge of the tax on VAT, it is also valid for the zm.
The Zm will be present at the clo.
Since 1. January 2007, the electronic charge has been mandatory.
The competent fa may allow exceptions for individual taxable persons in order to avoid undue hardships.
If the taxable person finds that the zm was flawed, he is to charge a correction zm within a month.
In Case of non-charge of zm, the clo is running a plagiarize.
This includes the following steps: - first memory - second memory, linked to the threat that a periodic penalty payment is fixed and - fixing of the forced payment.
Although the german federal government allows the fixing of a minimum price of up to 25.000 € (§ 329 AO), the clo sets periodic penalty payments of 125, 250 and 500 € in three steps.
In addition, § 26 a (1) no. 5 Ustg that the taxable person is irregular if he intentionally or lightly does not give a zm right, not complete or not in time or if he does not adjust a zm or not in time.
This infringement may be punishable by a fine of up to 5.000 €.
Data on intra-community deliveries can not be entered by the fä in the mias, because for the processing of the zm only the clo is responsible.
The data of the zm will only be stored at CLO.
The information from the summary reports is only available after their processing by the clo.
The deadlines for the processing of zm are in the council regulation (EC) no. 1798/2003 regulated.
The data of the zm must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect ust-Idnr. In the zm of German taxable person, the german clo receives a message "O _ Mctl" from the other member state.
Then the clo turns to the entrepreneur and calls for the right data.
If the clo does not succeed in receiving the right information, the case will be delivered to the relevant fa.
It is then the task of asking for the right information.
In The course of his examination, the brh found that most entrepreneurs are the VAT-Idnr. Corrected at the request of clo.
However, the memory and the threat and fixing of up to three consecutive periods require too much time when a taxable person may be involved in a cross-border payment process.
The cases that were finally reported to the competent fä were usually completed within one to two Mona-ten.
The relevant fa refused the exemption for the reported intra-community deliveries in 73 % of this price
The taxable person put the right vat rate. Before, the fa asked him to charge a corrected zm to the clo, because the fä can not correct the Mia data itself.
The brh found that neither the fä nor the clo controlled the charge of the corrected zm.
That's why the taxpayers of the call often didn't come. Since the clo does not have access to the data of the turnover, there is no comparison of the in the umsatzsteuervoranmeldungen or. the vat declaration on goods with the corresponding information in the zm before they are forwarded to the clo of the other member states.
This balancing can only be done by the fä. This is usually happening in the preparation of a sales tax.
Detailed data from other member states are processed at CLO.
Incorrect vat payment system. are recognized and reported to the affected member states.
The data is used to control the acquisition of taxation in the fä.
As soon as they are available in the system, the clo is similar to the data of previous calendar quarters.
Meet certain criteria (see 5.2), kontrollmitteilungen will be created and sent to the competent fä.
This is happening continuously, while a list of the acquisition data of all vat is created later and forwarded to the fä.
The Risk (RMS) for the predisposition procedure then evens out these data with those for intra-Community Purchase.
The system verifies completely (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully eligible for deduction of the VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries to a person registered in another member state must give a zm to the local competent fa within 25 days after the end of the month of the contract.
The Fä edit the zm and continue to guide the data to the clo.
The values of intra-community deliveries reported by the taxable persons in the zm are compared with the values of intra-community deliveries indicated by the same taxable persons in their prices.
The results of the comparison are taken into account in the context of the assessment.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries are to charge quarterly zm within the first 10 days of the following month.
Since January 1., 2007, taxpayers have to submit the zm electronically to clo.
The data from the zm are only available after their processing at the clo.
In the Czech Republic as well as in Germany, the taxable persons in the zm are only giving the goods.
The provision of services is not indicated in the zm. Unlike the Czech Fä, the German fä can not correct incorrect information in individual lines of the zm cast.
Due to this limited access to the German mias data, incorrect vat rates were added. Even then not corrected when the taxable person is the right ust-Idnr. announced to the fa.
The German financial administration is not based on the information provided by the corresponding zm for intra-community deliveries, which are made by German taxable persons in their VAT-free sales.
Differences between the dates of pre-registration and the zm are regularly not uncovered before the german clo to the mias data to other member states.
Due to these findings of the brh, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted mias data.
The data provided by other member states on goods to Czech taxable persons are compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchase of goods that the Czech taxable persons have indicated in their turnover.
The Czech clo is accepting the balancing for each calendar separately.
The most serious cases of deviations will be forwarded to the fä for testing.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-community acquisitions
Such a general control will only be carried out in taxable persons who are not fully eligible for deduction.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-community acquisitions of other taxable persons only if the rms has a test clue or the taxable person has been selected for an examination anyway
This procedure relieves the fä from clarifying the reasons for occurring differences.
On the other hand, the detection of fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat the risk of fraud, updated information on intra-community acquisitions must be available as early as possible
The current system of zm, especially mias, provides information to the tax authorities, which can be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxable persons had to give monthly zm.
The Monthly Levy would only significantly increase the bureaucratic effort, since most taxable persons in the Czech Republic and Germany are in any case for the charge of monthly payment fees. - the zm are no longer necessary for the zm, but for the zm or for the zm.-of.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the charge of the zm could be reduced by the charge of the turnover.-connected to of.
However, a duty for the monthly levy of zm would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-community deliveries and those of intra-community purchase and increase the flow of data between the clo
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly zm.
The implementation failed in the concerns of the federal states.
These were feared that a monthly transfer of mias data to the clo of other member states could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order to show the commitment to the monthly levy of zm effect, it is necessary to communicate at European level to the uniform monthly levy, so that a monthly update of the Mia data is possible.
Statistical Information on goods and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The Turnover of intra-community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany are in table no. 2 depicted.
Both audit demanded data on the number of false tax numbers or. UST-Idnr. In the o _ mctl notifications exchanged for the individual audited quarters between the Czech Republic and Germany.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of o _ mctl notifications.
While the czech clo refers to the numbers for which the zm has been issued, the german clo refers to its numbers on the calendar, in which o _ Mctlmeldung was received.
International Exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international information exchange in the Czech Republic
The International Exchange of information allows the now to receive information from other member states on intra-community transactions and on the taxable persons who have executed them.
Regulation (EC) no. 1798/2003 of the council on mutual assistance in the field of financial assistance, with which the directive (EEC) no. 218/92 has been repealed (Hereinafter " Regulation (EC) no "). 1798/2003 of the council "), distinguishes between two basic types of information exchange: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The International Exchange of information on request is made by a request for information (request for information rfi) using the standardized jourgensen form.
The now in the Czech Republic send their rfi or. Your answers to a preserved rfi through the finance to the clo. This concerns the translation of the information provided in the standardized jourgensen form in the foreign language and the forwarding to the other member states.
In addition, the clo receives information request (RFI) from other member states and the answers to sent requests. It concerned their translation into the Czech and their distribution to the competent fä for processing.
Art. 8 of regulation (EC) no. 1798/2003 sets a period of not more than three months from reception of the request for its processing.
All the rfi exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the verified period were checked by the nku.
70 cases (i.e. 74,5 %) were processed within the months. In Another 23 cases (i.e. 24,5 %) this processing was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no answer was sent to Germany until the test by the nku. More detailed information on the deadlines, within the requests made by Germany by the Czech Republic, were answered in the graph 2.
From the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) directed by the Czech Republic to Germany, in 136 cases (i.e. 40,6 %) there was an answer within the months; another 179 (i.e. 53,4) %) were processed after the end of this period and in 19 cases the audit by the nku was not yet received from Germany (in the remaining one case, due to the declared information, it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the request for information from the Czech Republic was answered from Germany, is published in graphic no. 3.
The percentages of intra-community sales indicated in the request for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are in graphic no. 4 depicted.
The above graph shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of more than 60.000 €.
The International Exchange of information without prior request is either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Other member states are often provided with information without prior request, which are important for the fixing of the vat liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual member states is carried out electronically.
"Automatic Exchange" in accordance with regulation (EC) no. 1798/2003 of the council means the systematic transmission of previously specified information to other member states in regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
'structured automatic exchange' means the systematic transmission of previously specified information to another member state without its previous request, as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other member states of the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new.
This information refers to the registration form from the form message on the delivery of a certificate as referred to in § 19 of law no. 235/2004 as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the, carries the required data in the corresponding template and directs it directly to the competent employee of the finance, where these data are collected and sent to the clo for further processing. After that, these data will be sent to the other member states within the prescribed period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were won.
The Czech Republic also sends the other member states information on sales in order mail, which are exempt in the country of origin, to be non-taxable, which appear inadmissible and to potential "missing traders".
This information will be forwarded to the other member states by means of a jourgensen form in the spontaneous exchange of information
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information from local competent fa goes out.
The Fä send the completed form Jourgensen 2004 by e-mail directly to the german clo, which transmits the jourgensen forms to the foreign clo.
The Fä are instructed to draw up their request for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used jourgensen form is a language-Chig.
Half of the German request for information audited by the brh was sent in order to ensure the acquisition of taxation in the other member state. to demonstrate the tax of intra-community delivery from Germany to the other member state.
If the german clo receives a request from another member state, it shall verify whether the value of the deliveries referred to in the request exceeds the limit of 15.000 €.
If there is no appropriate justification for the request, the german clo refuses to provide information about a turnover below the minimum border.
In addition, the german clo concerned the translation of the freely formulated texts in the jourgensen form [(B1- 17) or (E)], if they are not written in German or in English.
In order to answer the request for information, the clo directs this to the competent fa and refers to the application of the request
No further deadlines are set at the different levels of the German financial administration.
The German clo has the technical means to monitor the timeliness, but not about the necessary manpower to remind the fä of the answers to the request for information.
The Fä will receive the required information by writing the taxable person or conducting an external exam.
The external auditors usually choose between two payment units: the VAT payment system that covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months or the so-called VAT-according to which, if necessary. Only referring to a recent process.
In this short and flexible audit form, an announcement is not required against the taxable person and has proven itself in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the automatic exchange of information, Germany will send the other member state the following information: - VIA UST-Idnr., which have been allocated to companies resident in other EC Member States, - on the reimbursement of the vat to entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC member states are.
In addition, Germany has decided to send the following information to the other EC member states in the framework of the structured automatic exchange exchange:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without ustidnr., b. Acquisitions (mail order) to other EC Member States, which are not subject to vat in Germany, c. Significant differences between the purchase of a taxable person reported by a taxable person and the mias data transmitted by other member states, d. Intra-community deliveries of items subject to taxation in Germany by the taxable person, e. Potential " missing traders " that have made intra-community transactions, regardless of whether they have been sold out. Still valid is or has already been deleted and f. Taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries to potential " missing trader " or to customers who have made a VAT refund. Abusive use.
Comparison and evaluation
The Dispatch of request for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent authorities, which send the corresponding jourgensen forms to the clo.
While the czech clo used bilingual jourgensen forms (Czech-English) and provided information in the English or German language. German language translated, the German language students follow the instruction to draw up request for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German clo does not produce translations of German texts.
During the examination of requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period 1. May 2004 to 31. December 2005, the nku noted that the Czech financial administration completed 74,5 % of the request received within the months, while the request for information sent to Germany by the German financial administration has been completed only in 40,6 % of the cases within this period.
Although the german clo has the fä on the months, it does not monitor their compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of request requests for information.
That's why the brh recommended a continuous memory procedure to the german clo.
The situation has changed by now.
According to the information we have received, the german clo is now remembering the answer to the pending request for information.
VAT risk management
Risk Management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several financial institutions have been involved in the management of vat on various levels of financial management.
Within the Czech Ministry of finance, the following financial institutions are responsible for the risk management and the fight against turnover:
The Department of methodology and economic management of sales tax or. Their risk management unit deals with the determination of potential risk fields for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Intra-community trade.
At the national level, this position coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of the turnover" and uses the Mia data to discover possible investment opportunities within the framework of intra-community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risky goods, prepares risk management in the field of VAT and works together in this area with the competent ec institutions and the other member states.
The Department of international assistance in the field of vat provides, among other things, for the exchange of information, works in the creation and development of a relevant financial management, enhances the data available in the system system, and provides public relations and is for other forms of intergovernmental assistance in the sense council regulation (EC) 1798/2003 responsible.

The Department of methodology of the audit and IRS introduces risk analysis in the context of the methodological control of audits, sets priorities for the planning of the financial directorates in terms of the selection of cases to be examined, creates risk analysis to combat tax evasion and collect information in this context financial management as well as other sources and make proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax vacancies are available at the financial directorates. their tasks include the search for taxable persons and industries that are pregnant with regard to the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for non-registered taxable persons (e.g. in the industry services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.).), the investigation of linkages in chain fraud and the disclosure of the local tax authorities.
Special exam units have been set up in 12 selected fä.
These have regional competence and, due to the appropriate empowerment, are also carried out outside the local jurisdiction of the fä.
The need for the establishment of the special audit units was shown by the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, especially in connection with chain stores.
These special units examine in accordance with the needs of the tax agencies. Focus on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms to reduce the risks in the field of vat have been integrated into the atis system: - the task " credibility of the turnover " to assess the risk of pregnancy tax returns, - the task " selection of taxable taxable persons ", the taxable persons to be inspected to be selected on the basis of certain criteria, the task of " mias ", which allows for access to the data provided by the other EC member states.
The task of "MIAS" allows for the following: - Review of the validity of the ust-Idnr. from taxable persons from other member states, - confirmation of the value of goods delivered to a Czech taxable person as indicated in the zm by all suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other member states, - creation of a list of taxable persons who have not issued zm, - formal control of the information that taxable persons have made in the Czech Republic in their zm before they are sent to other member states, - creation of a list of taxable persons in whose turnover the information on goods to other member states does not correspond to the information in the zm, - creation of a list of taxable persons in which the information on the value of goods purchased from other member states is not available with the information in the zm of all its suppliers from other member states
As part of their financial strategy to combat tax evasion, the now have access to data from state authorities such as commercial registers, registry, kraftfahrzeugregister, gewerberegister etc.
More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1 of the summary and processing of the summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk Management in Germany
Due to their federal construction, both the bundesﬁnanzbehörden (in particular the CLO) and the, of the 16 Federal States are involved in the development and introduction of a rms in the Federal Republic of Germany.
There are joint working groups for development, but neither the clo nor the federal government of the federal states have a uniform data base.
At the level of the clo, the unit st I 2 (Hereinafter "kiss" - Coordination Centre for sales tax and irs measures) collects the information on fraud in the opus database.
In collaboration with the countries, another database called magic has been set up during the kiss. There, the tax can enter the names of discovered missing traders or turnover fraudsters and also query.
The kiss coordinates both related cases of fraud at national level as well as cases of cross-border fraud.
The experiences of the kiss are presented by their cooperation in the working groups in the development of the RMS.
In addition, professionals of several other of of the clo and the bmf are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of ustidnr. Other member states that appear in the zm of German taxpayers will be carried out at CLO.
This formal review takes place before the transfer of the zm to other member states, in order to improve the reliability of the Mia data and thus its benefits (s. 4.4.2).
The examination of validity in the ZM CALLED UST-Idnr. Take place on the basis of the o _ Mctl Identifiers provided by the other member states (for the rectification of invalid vat payment codes., see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS OF CLO IS BASED ON MIAS data transmitted by the other member states and generates various types of communications to discover suspected missing traders. As an indication, certain characteristics are used, which usually occur in carousel stores.
The Federal States of the federal states are dependent on the processing of these notifications and have forwarded the result of their investigation to clo in certain cases.
The Audit by the brh has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to close with sufficient probability to a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).
Accordingly, the brh has recommended the bmf to work in the creation of the communications with combinations of different indications.
The risk should also take into account other indications, such as the rateable value of the taxable person, the industry or the company's participation.
A second level of risk management consists of the federal government of the federal states and focuses on the processing of the sales tax and the annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of those taxable persons who are in their business or business. Annual Declaration of intra-community deliveries.
This list will be sent to the clo for monitoring the full charge of the zm.
Furthermore, this type of risk management compares the acquisitions indicated by the taxable person in his annual VAT DECLARATION WITH THE DATA IN THE MIAS.
The Federal Republic of Germany is avoiding a comparison of tax fraud, as these would result in many inconsistencies due to other factors than tax evasion or tax fraud; z. B.:
- supplier and acquirer go from different dates for the execution of intra-community turnover;
- different accounting coverage and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to the comparison of the data from the turnover with the mias data, many federal states have certain mechanisms of risk management based on information in the turnover and certain other indications (e.g. Firmenwortlaut, age of holders / partners, number of employees and payment method of the taxable person).
Bavaria has introduced a set of rules based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists to fight tax fraud (Hereinafter "risk") to programming their own rules in such a way that alleged fraudsters are being carried out.
This system will be used when processing the umsatzsteuervoranmeldungen through the fä.
This will give the competent fa the hints of the rms before the VAT is fixed.
Since this system is not teachable, the risk have to adjust the rules according to the feedback from the fä.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed a multi-Purpose Network based on the data-based hint parenting cases.
Due to this data, the rms is capable of learning the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system creates a monthly list of steuerfällen where there is evidence of tax evasion.
Due to this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the test, the tax have to report their results, so the rms can learn from the results of the tests proposed by it.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, a adaptive neural network is used in combination with a fuzzy fuzzy system.
Based on many data from processed turnover and some other indications, this neuro-Fuzzy System (also called mining system) is calculated as probably it is that a taxable person is involved in tax fraud.
After that, it creates a monthly list of alleged fraudsters.
Due to this list, the fä select the taxable persons concerned and report the test results to the data center in question.
The Introduction of these three rms is in the federal states.
Since each of these three systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for the fight against fraud appears to be beneficial
Whether the expected effects will be set in the actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although in this report it is not possible to treat the specific criteria of the rms in Czech and Germany, however, the nku and the brh have found that each member state has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German Federal States, the rms of each European State has its special strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experiences between the tax authorities of the European member states on new trends and new models of cross-Border Sales.
The fraud - especially the carousel - has proved to be not a national but European problem.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one, but in several member states.
A member state alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for a rms must be exchanged and implemented in each EC member state. If this does not happen, scammers are looking for the member state with the weakest rms for their crimes.
The fraud caused by Europe-wide fraud in vat does not necessarily affect the member state in which the initiator is resident.
Any other member state that is involved in fraud may be affected.
That's why there should be a European exchange of experiences on the RMS.
Selected results from the testing of individual transactions under the parallel tests examined the quality and the usability of information on selected deliveries and the application of the parallel.
To Acquire the object of the international exchange of information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two legal entities jointly reviewed the liquidation of several deliveries, which were doubts about their execution, or which the taxable persons of both states declared differently in the tax returns or zm.
At the request of the brh, the nku examined eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxable persons.
In addition, in 43 cases, due to communications from the brh, the nku verified the values of intra-community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxpayers had indicated in their tax returns
At the request of the nku, the brh reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information has been exchanged exclusively on the basis of council regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on clo.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different procedures of registration in the EC member states lead to the problems referred to in chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the Mia data, a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth € 60.500 in the third quarter of 2004 from a German taxable person.
When the Czech taxable person declared a purchase of only € 29.869, the Czech financial administration addressed a request for information to Germany in order to review the value of the delivered goods
The German page gave in its response to the Czech request for information, the German taxable person concerned had to his Czech business partner in the 2. TH QUARTER OF 2004 goods worth 27.381 €, in the third quarter were worth 31.997 € and delivered in the fourth quarter worth 10.276 €
Further, it was found from the answer that the ust-Idnr. The German taxable person was only valid from 28. September 2004 however, the german clo had accepted another request from the German taxable person and the validity of the vat tax code. Moving forward retroactively to 1. May 2004
The German taxable person corrected the zm.
Due to this information, it was a (Intra-community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxable person.
By a request from the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the nku noted that in 2004, the Czech taxable person issued additional tax allowances for the individual (Infraannual) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of the acquisitions from other member states and at the same time, the deduction of vat from the purchase from the other member states coveted.
The competent clerk of the Czech Ministry of transport could not clearly determine the value of deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier in the declared purchase.
In response to a request from the nku, the brh found that the German supplier had been registered as a the in September 2003
Je-but he did not apply for the allocation of a VAT payment card in the registration., but only one of the tax numbers in force for Germany.
Although in Germany it is usually not possible for a taxable person to retroactively VAT a VAT rate. In 2006, the competent clerk of the German financial administration did so retroactively on may 1., 2004.
The German clo shares a UST-Idnr. Retroactively, if the company has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the clo has the delay after the taxable person's request to grant a VAT payment. Caused.
In this case, the clo gives the ust-Idnr. Retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not have valid vat rates according to § 6 Ustg for an intra-community delivery. Needed.
Conversely, a German Acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT payment card. His supplier to explain the intra-Community Acquisition.
Due to this conflict between the member states, the german clo granted the vat tax code. In this special case retroactively.
2.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech, asked for the review of the turnover tax registration of the German entrepreneur.
The Mias data is the registration date of 5. March 2005, while the registration certificate issued by the local competent German fa is indicated on 1. October 2004
The German authorities informed in their reply that the German taxable person was registered on 1. October 2004, but for organisational reasons it was only on 16. February 2005 in Germany a vat tax on VAT. Get assigned.
By request at the local competent Czech National Court, the nku learned that the, had carried out a VAT test for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 until the second quarter of 2005
In this audit, the finanzamt found that in its vat declaration, the Czech taxable person had declared services worth 9.897 czk, which he made to the German taxable person before his turnover tax registration (i.e. before 1. October 2004).
The (Czech) Tax Office Set a tax liability of 1.880 czk compared to the Czech taxable person for the third quarter of 2004
Due to the request of the nku, the brh found that the German taxable person is the VAT-Idnr. It was only allocated when it was awarded on 16. February 2005 at the fa its company founded in 2004
In addition, the fa registered retroactively from 1. October 200415 for the purposes of VAT, in order to monitor the charge of the vat declaration for 2004
In this vat declaration, the taxable person gave intra-community acquisitions from the Czech Republic Worth 160 € (approx. 5.000 czk) on.
3. in its vat declaration for September 2004 as well as in its zm for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person with a value of 114.615 czk gave a German taxable person.
When checking the registration of the German taxable person in the system mias, the Czech, found that this registration was only valid from 11. November 2004 and thus after the registration period to Germany.
The Czech taxable person gave a supplementary vat declaration, in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth 114.615 czk and vat of 21.777 czk, which he paid.
By a request from the local competent fa in the Czech Republic, the nku found that the Czech taxable person subsequently submitted an application for the resumption of the taxation procedure in terms of the additional vat declaration. As a receipt, he submitted a confirmation from the German financial administration that the German taxable person was registered since 1. January 2000
Accordingly, the Czech National Court reviewed the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer as part of the international exchange of information
From The German information, it was found that the German taxable person is only on 11. November 2004, i.e. after the date of the registration, a vat tax. Had been assigned.
As a result, the Czech National Court dismissed the request for a resumption of the taxation procedure.
The brh found that there was no intra-community acquisition of goods in this case, because the German taxable person was only on 11. November 2004 a vat tax. Had received.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as intra-community acquisition as well as the sales tax and also demanded the refund of input at the same height.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxable person, the German, did not corrected the information in the vat declaration.
The brh also found that the company of the German taxable person mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxable persons.
This name change with the German taxable person also confused the Czech National Court.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German, reviewed the acquisition of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxable person from a German taxable person worth 22.686 €.
By a request at the local competent office in the Czech Republic, the nku found that the Czech National Court had examined in the context of an external examination of the Czech taxable person whether the delivery was actually carried out and whether the Czech taxable person was the invoice for the delivery of the had been registered and paid.
The Czech taxable person did not declare the purchase of the goods in his vat declaration, because the German supplier does not have his vat tax on the invoice. Just indicated its tax number for business within Germany.
According to the Mia data, the German taxable person is registered for vat in connection with intra-community sales only from 21. April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable taxable person.
The Czech Federal Ministry of finance also asked for the German financial administration to send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxable person to make it possible. An appropriate training program could start.
The Czech fa considered this business as the acquisition of goods by a non-Entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not establish vat on the acquisition of goods from Germany.
The brh found that, according to German law, a taxable person who delivers goods to other member states does not have a vat tax. For Intra-community deliveries, in order to be able to benefit from the tax exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier just needs to get the ustidnr. The Acquirer in the other member state has been able to prove the transport of the goods in question in the other member state
In this case, the turnover according to German tax law is a (intra) Intra-community delivery that should be subject to the acquisition of taxation in the Czech Republic.
It is important, anyway, that the Czech, took note of this transaction, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier
As described in section 4.6.2, the german clo rejects request for information on intra-community transactions, if they are under the minimum limit of 15.000 €: 5.
According to Mia's data, a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth € 12.561 in the third quarter of 2004 from a German taxable person.
The Czech Federal Ministry of economic affairs undertook an audit for this tax period.
In the context of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration asked for the examination of these delivery by means of a jourgensen form.
The Czech taxable person declared that he did not receive the goods, had never been in business relationship with the German company and the acquisition of the goods in question was not registered with him.
The German financial administration dismissed the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and invoices - because the turnover was less than 15.000 € and no other reason was given.
Since the Czech, did not receive any documents for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the audit remained inconclusive, and the original assessment had a stock.
Due to a request from the nku, the brh found that the German taxable person acted as " Fiskalvertreter17" (§ 22 (a) - (E) Ustg).
The German taxable person explained these deliveries in his vat declaration and in the zm.
His right to tax exemption has been recognized.
Due to the notification by the brh, the German fa will send the documents needed for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In Section 4.6.1, it was shown that the answers of the German financial administration to request for information exceeded the months more often than the answers of the Czech financial
6. in its audit, the nku found that on 5. October 2005, the Czech financial administration had sent a request for information on the value of WA-ren deliveries to Germany in the 4. TH QUARTER OF 2004
In the zm for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a discount of 86.307 € on the Czech taxable person; however, the Czech taxable person declared for the same period in his vat declaration only the acquisition of goods worth 35.314 €.
In the answer to the request for information, which of the Czech Republic on 9. May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the in kind. 8 of regulation (EC) no. In 1798/2003, the council informed the German page that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005
Because the German financial administration did not apply the deadline for the processing of the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech a requested a jourgensen form to review a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person worth 1.265.554 €, in the third and fourth quarter of 2004, with indications for Carousel Templates.
The nku noted that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information was not yet received.
By a request at the local competent office, the nku found that the Czech taxable person did not explain the delivery of new motor vehicles to these german taxable persons worth 11.816.103 czk in his vat declaration.
The Czech National Court corrected the information in the tax declaration and the Czech taxable person gave a corrected zm.
Due to technical problems, the german clo did not lead this request for information to the local competent fa.
After the notification by the brh, a sales tax special was carried out at the German Acquirer in Germany. It was found that the acquisition of all the vehicles in question had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were further sold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. According to the Mia data, the Czech taxable person purchased a car worth € 48.500 in the 4. TH QUARTER OF 2004 from a German taxable person.
However, the Czech taxable person did not declare intra-community acquisition
By request of the local competent office in the Czech Republic, the nku found that the Czech taxable person had not issued a vat declaration since August 2004
The Czech taxable person gave no tax returns even after the request by the federal court of justice. As a result, on 23. May 2005, the fa fixed the vat debt for the period October to December 2004 with zero.
On 2. June 2005, the clo created an instruction to test the delivery of the said delivery by the German taxable person.
Since the Czech taxable person did not work with the now, he addressed a request for information on the above delivery to Germany.
Since the answer to the request for information was only received on 7. February 2007, until the end of the audit of the nku, it was not known how the Czech, used the information gained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the obligations of the Czech Republic, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted from 23. August 2005
In some cases, only a a was sent because at the time of the test of the nku and the brh the competent fa had not completed the outside exam yet:
9.
In 2005, the Czech, asked for the review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person worth 16.991 €, in the third quarter of 2004, with a reference to carousel templates.
In his answer to the request for information, the German Federal Ministry of foreign affairs announced that it would only present the invoices issued by the Czech tax-erp flicht on deliveries worth 16.335 €.
Due to the request of the nku, the brh found that the external audit carried out by the German fa was not yet completed at the acquirer in Germany.
The German Acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth 16.335 € double in its sales tax of for the months August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech National Court asked for the review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxable person worth 198.167 €, in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, using a jourgensen form, with a signs of Carousel Templates.
The German financial administration submitted a request for information on the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxable person had acquired several motor vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany was not yet completed.
The nku found that the local competent fa had carried out several external tests for the Czech taxable person to review the deduction of above-average high-quality prices.
However, a claim has not been detected.
The brh noted that for the period in question, the German taxable person had declared the acquisition of goods from other member states in the total value of 579.114 € in his turnover, and that the German fa's audit of the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
In Section 4.4.1, the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-community acquisitions in the recipient's vat declaration and the information in the zm of the supplier are described.
In the cases audited, it was found that periodic is-keiten18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-community trade fair were not the most common reasons for the differences
11.
According to the data from mias, the Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 35.716 € from the German taxable person in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech taxable person did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxable person did not work with the now and did not take business at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech, asked for verification as part of the international exchange of information, as the German taxable person had communicated with the Czech.
The German answer to the request for information showed that according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech taxable person was unknown at the indicated address and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder
The total value of the order was 155.000 €, but the German taxable person delivered only goods worth 21.659 €.
The Czech tax office sent the German taxable person a false payment fee over the amount of 155.153 € in favor of the German taxable person.
After detection of the fraudulent conduct of the Czech Acquirer, the German taxable person managed to recover the delivered material with the exception of a part worth 7.916 € with the support of his other Czech customers.
By a request from the local competent fa in the Czech Republic, the nku found that due to the information received, the financial management was able to carry out the umsatzbesteuerung of goods from other member states in the amount of 388.522 czk.
Due to a request from the nku, the German supplier confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a minimum price to the Czech taxable value of 7.916 €.
According to German legislation, the German taxable person declared the delivery of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.
His zm contained the following information for Czech taxable persons:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration asked for the review of a financial management and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005. through a
According to the request for information, the Czech taxable person had delivered a total value of 396.126 € to the German taxable person during the period in question and provided services worth € 11.885
The nku found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit with the Czech taxable person to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration shared that the Czech taxable person delivered and mounted a production plant to the German.
The Czech taxable person delivered the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was mounted on the basis of the order after 1. May 2004
The German taxable person did not accept the mounted production plant and claimed deficiencies.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person calculated the production plant for 107.100 € and 11.885 € for services.
The German taxable person received the legal provisions, but did not recognize her and did not pay her.
By request of the local competent office in the Czech Republic, the nku noted that all invoices were duly registered in the books of the Czech taxable person.
The financial statements for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech taxable person and were related to invoices issued after the first may 2004
The brh found that the local competent fa came to the conclusion due to the response of the Czech financial administration, in these transactions it is a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxable person to the Germans, including the assembly.
In this special case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is mounted.
The German recipient of the factory delivery owes the sales tax according to the German legislation.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction at the same height.
Since the turnover tax of the German taxable person remained unchanged, the German fa did not make any correction of the vat declaration.
13. According to the Mia data, the Czech taxable a purchased a machine worth 58.000 € from the German taxable person c in February 2005
The Czech National Council addressed a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side shared that the German taxable person c delivered this machine to the Czech taxable b in 2004, which, however, gave it back to the German taxable person c in October 2004
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not returned to Germany, but was transported to the branch of the German taxable person c in the Czech Republic.
From the answer to the request for information, the German taxable person c delivered the machine to the Czech taxable a in February 2005
This took the machine at the headquarters of the branch of the German taxable person in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from c to a) was only carried out within the Czech Republic, there was no internal community policy.
By request for the taxable person responsible for the taxable b, the nku found that the German taxable person c was delivered to the Czech taxable person (another machine) worth 88.027 € in the third quarter of 2004, according to Mia's data..
The taxable person b declared that he did not receive this goods, so that the local competent Czech National Court addressed a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine was delivered.
In The course of further investigation at the taxable person b, the, found that the machine of 88.027 € was not entered in the taxable b and that it could be the same type of machine as it was the branch of the German taxable person c in the on February 2005, 2005, the Czech taxpayer a delivered.
The Court of first instance continued to note that the Czech National Court responsible for the taxable person had an examination in this case.
The, had the invoice of the German taxable person c of 7. February 2005, in which the taxable person is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech National Court noted that the taxable person had not entered this invoice.
The taxable person had completed a lease agreement with another Czech company, whose object was a machine of the same kind.
The Leasing company delivered the machine on February 9., 2005 and also concerned the transport.
The Czech fa did not use the information provided in the answer to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxable person a.
The brh found that the German taxable person c delivered the machine worth 88.027 € not to the Czech Republic, but to another german taxable person d.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community Trade Fair, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax court did not recognize the claim of the German tax-free c on the vat exemption and corrected the information in its tax declaration.
The German taxable d delivered the machine to the Czech taxable person b.
According to German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but lost the vat in the Czech Republic.
The brh continued to note that the German taxable person c in his zm for the first quarter of 2005 had indicated the delivery of a machine worth 58.000 € to the Czech taxable person a.
This delivery was not checked at the audit carried out by the German fa.
The following figure represents the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the abovementioned stores.
14.
At the request of the request for information, the nku found that the Czech financial administration had received a request from Germany on 4. October 2005, in which a German Federal Ministry of finance received the review of intra-community deliveries of a German taxable value worth 879.680.625 € Czech taxpayers requested.
The German Federal Court of justice announced that there is a suspicion that this is a fictitious intra-community criminal law.
The German taxable person has not exercised an active business since 1999
The nku found that the Czech National Court had carried out an external audit with the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company explained that it is probably a claim of the German taxable person compared to the German financial administration, which the Czech taxable person has claimed as shareholder in the German company at the German fa.
According to the information made in relation to the nku, the Czech National Court has so far no information that the German financial administration is editing the case with reference to the Czech taxpayer.
The information in question shows that it has not been a trade fair; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored as an intra-community trade fair from Germany to a Czech taxable person in mias.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to indicate intra-community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (S.A. section 4.4.1):
15. According to the Mia data, a German taxable person delivered a total value of 33.205 €. for the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005
However, the Czech taxable person did not declare intra-Community Acquisition.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech, asked for an examination of the delivery from Germany.
In its response to this request for information, the German side explained that the German taxable person sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person, and the rest of the goods picked up this personally.

This exam has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the Mia data, a German taxable person had delivered to a Czech taxable goods worth 46.854 € in the third quarter of 2004
For the same period, a Czech taxable person declared the intra-community acquisition of goods worth only 14.856 €.

In its Czech sales tax declaration, he did not report vat on the sale of goods in Germany.
Due to a supplementary vat declaration issued after the external audit, the Czech National Court fixed the vat liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, a purchase of goods from other member states was not available in this case, since the goods were not shipped or transported by another member state to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech, has drawn a wrong conclusion during the outside test.
The brh found that, immediately after receipt of the answer to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German taxable person corrected the tax declaration of the German taxable person and demanded the payment of vat worth 1.600 €.
In addition, the competent fa submitted a control notification to the fa responsible for the actual recipient of the goods, to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.

The brh found that the German court of justice did not corrected the vat declaration of the German Acquirer, since a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit has not shown any signs of tax fraud, there is no view of being able to raise a fixed VAT fault actually.
20. According to the Mia data, a German taxable person purchased in 2005 goods from the Czech Republic worth 4.251.196 €, after which he had acquired a value of 43.274 € in the previous year.
The German taxable person did not declare the intra-community acquisitions in his vat declaration 2004 nor in the 2005. for the year 2005.

Due to these inconsistencies, the German fa presented a request for information regarding the 4. TH QUARTER OF 2005 and the 1. th
In the zm for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community sales in the total value of 167.246.083 czk.
On 6. September 2006, the request for information was published in which the German page asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxable person actually took place.
In the answer to this request for information, the Czech financial administration explained that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company is not a managing director (or. OTHER LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES) have.
From the documents provided by the competent now, it is clear that together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer on 30. March 2006, a protocol on the beginning of the turnover tax erprüfung for the 4. TH QUARTER OF 2004 and the period January to December 2005 was created.
At the same time, the taxable person was asked by the now to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but this is what

The Czech taxable person has not given any sales tax returns since April 2006
As part of the parallel audit, the nku, in cooperation with the brh, examined several cases of intra-community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the
The two audit exchanged information about the cases audited via the clo of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not resident in Germany, taught the competent fa (Chemnitz-South) that it would make taxable shops in Germany.
Due to this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but did not receive any german vat tax.
The (UCR) took a contract from a Danish company (Udk) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, to the risk and invoice of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own sales costs, the Danish company gave a part of the order to a German taxable person (ude) in Germany.
The following figure represents the contractual relationships and the transport route of wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these shops must be determined as described below:
- the Danish company (Udk) sent the wind turbines in its name, at its risk and for its own invoice for assembly to Austria.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of wind turbines is controlled in Austria.
- because the forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (Udk) and the latter made transport in its own name, at its own risk and for its own invoice, it is place of delivery of the German sub-Entrepreneur (ude) where the transport has begun, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines have been delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-Entrepreneur (ude), as the EC has been registered for the-member state for which the delivery was intended to be a different than the state of the Czech unternehmens19.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its payment documents.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) is also aimed at the place where the transport has begun.
However, some of the wind turbines have been transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- the delivery of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- the delivery of the rest of the wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria as well as intra-community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The brh found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its zm delivered to the german clo.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-community deliveries uniformly as intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The nku found that (UCR) did not report intra-community deliveries to Austria, but intra-community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial institutions (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion
In addition, the nku and the brh were examined in order to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation of 2004 between the data in the turnover and the mias data.
The cases audited also show that it takes some time until the taxable persons and the tax payers apply the new statutory regulations:
22. in its zm for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person registered a total value of 792.977.452 czk to a German taxable person.
In the same period, another czech taxable person in his zm reported intra-community deliveries to another german taxable person with a total value of 18.157.265 czk.
From the information provided by the brh to the nku, it was found that in both cases, it was a matter of electricity.
Both Czech taxable persons took account of the above deliveries in accordance with the Czech law no. 2004 in force. 235/2004 in their zm.
In a further examination of these transactions, a audit of the nku found that in 2004 different statutory regulations on delivery or delivery were made. The acquisition of electric energy between the Czech Republic and Germany was considered.
While in the Czech Republic, the taxable persons are supplying electrical energy according to the provisions of law no 2004 valid in 2004 235/2004 as an intra-Community Trade Fair, according to the German legislation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-community acquisition of goods, but about taxable and taxable sales in Germany.
The differences in the statutory regulations were made in the Czech Republic by adopting the law no. 635/2004 eliminated, which has changed some tax provisions with effect from 1. January 2005
23. in the examination of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the brh were further found that a Czech taxable person in his zm for the first and fourth quarter of 2005 Intra-community deliveries to a German taxable person with a total value of 240.411.163 czk and another czech taxable person in his zm for the same period of intra-community deliveries to another german taxable person, worth 263.470.776 czk.
Information provided by the brh to the nku showed that in both cases it was about deliveries of electric energy.
In accordance with the wording of the law no. 1. January 2005 235/2004 is the place of performance for the delivery of electric energy to the place where the acquirer has its legal seat, its place of business or its establishment, for which this delivery is made.
That's why Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the electricity in their zm for 2005
The fact that both taxable persons treated the delivery of electrical energy in their zm as intra-community deliveries led to a betragsmäßigen difference of 503.881.939 czk in mias.
Conclusion
The cooperation has reached the goals of the brh and the nku.
Both audit won of knowledge of the systems of vat administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation opened differences in the two systems and in the statutory regulations applicable to the vat administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries were found. Acquisitions to days.
Some of these are worth a further observation.
On the basis of the test results, both audit made recommendations on the management of VAT.
The Follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a run should be part of further observation.
The new experiences and knowledge gained by the cooperation of both audit are the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of vat administration.
