Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the courts of auditors have the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires the courts of auditors to have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.
The organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VIth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the courts of auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit work of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly intertwined and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national courts of auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the courts of auditors of other states.
As an example, the investigation of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Audit bodies in this area must be prepared to work closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the VAT and the VIES system was developed at the VIth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating courts of auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the audit items for the audit planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
File number: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
 (CZ) Administration of VAT after the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
 (DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
The Commission's audit objective:
 (CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the area of turnover tax after the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of VIES1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
 (DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on administrative assistance in the area of turnover tax in accordance with the regulations mentioned above.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European guideline no. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI auditing standards.
The audit covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the "exchange of information" priority under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation 1925/2004, other closely related issues have also been examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.
In addition, the examination also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number only applicable to domestic transactions for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must request the grant of a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, the international carriage of passengers by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation under Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover taxes (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, taxable persons are required to file VAT returns only for periods of less than one year (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly) 
VAT pre-registrations and a VAT annual declaration after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany have to submit their VAT registrations electronically.
The introduction of the mandatory electronic filing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of Czech financial management (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary notifications to the tax authorities (FÄ), German taxpayers have to submit the summary notifications to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary notifications will be available to the FÄ in the Czech Republic immediately after their submission.
The information from the summary notifications will only be available to the German authorities after they have been processed by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary notifications would shorten the period between the date of the turnover and the update of the VIES data.
This would allow for a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.
5) International exchange of information in the area of sales tax.
In the case of in-depth requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the prescribed period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a permanent monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of a RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax subjects.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using CLO's legal options, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Courts of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ took advantage of the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In these cases, the taxable persons either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not declare the purchase of goods in their VAT declaration.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax payers have inaccurately reported transactions in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the VIES were accordingly incorrect, so that the clerks (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the territorial audit departments of Central Bohemia, North West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
Audited positions were: Ministry of Finance and 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of NKÚ approved the examination findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the audit area of traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following cases were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mit Cologne-Porz, Cologne-South, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-South, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the examination were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held between representatives of both courts of auditors.
Participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of financial management, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were identified for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.
2.
International carriage of passengers by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the action of the tax officials in the processing of requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary notifications.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the VAT area.
At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarised themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel examinations already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of 1,000,000 CZK, will be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Law No. 235/2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer who has exceeded the registration deadline.
A businessman with a legal seat, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other conditions mentioned in Law No 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements laid down in the law, can voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure pursuant to Law No. 337/1992 begins with the receipt of the application for registration by the local tax official.
If you want to register voluntarily for sales tax, you have to indicate in your application the date from which you apply for registration as a sales tax.
The financial officer has to check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information given therein, he has to ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information given.
If the financial officer has verified that the trader fulfils the conditions for registration, he has to give a written opinion on the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the tax official has to indicate the date of entry into force of the registration of the turnover tax and the assessment period for the sales tax.
The predisposition period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least 10,000,000 CZK.
If this is the case, the predisposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as a predisposition period and has to inform the tax officials of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The taxable person must provide the tax number in every communication (including payments) with the tax official, and in cases where a special law requires it (e.g., Law No. 235/2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, to the extent specified by a special law. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (according to the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite the appropriate request from the finance officer, the local finance officer has to register him ex officio.
A communication will also be issued to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every business-approved entrepreneur receives a tax number on his first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
Pursuant to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the duty to register the turnover tax, the tax payer may demand that up to 10% of the proceeds of the taxable transaction, which the person concerned has unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date on which the trader should have been registered as a taxable person, until the date on which registration as a taxable person is made available by the tax officials took place (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
The payment of the fixed amount is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a taxable person can be deleted for two reasons:
1) 
Cancellation of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
A taxable person may request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) Cancellation of registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235/2004) if: a) the taxable person has not performed for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officials of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235/2004, c) the former taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements for tax liability.
B) Taxable persons without a legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who, in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235/2004, has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries ("non-resident entrepreneur ") the provision of the service in question is subject to tax.
He must apply for registration with the Prague 1 FA at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
It is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT IDs allocated to it in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable supply of services in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 FA has to register him retroactively, since he became subject to VAT in accordance with Law No. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable supply of services in the Czech Republic.
In the event of a retroactive registration, the Prague 1 FA must request proof (invoices or written explanations) of the performance from the operators concerned.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, the Prague 1 FA has to request the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the Prague 1 FA, of which 124 were from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax official is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or declarations and to pay taxes.
During the examination of the NKÚ, it turned out that in the case of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this statement has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to cancel the registration of the non-resident businessman for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulations (§§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and/or the competent tax office.
This notification must be made no later than one month after the start of the business.
The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has started but has not been registered, it can also register the taxable person ex officio retroactively.
In Germany, tax payers, regardless of whether they are resident or not, are obliged to register for Zwekke's sales tax if they meet the requirements of Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of sales generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
For foreign-based entrepreneurs, special funds are in charge.
For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of April 30, 2004, the total number of registered Czech entrepreneurs was 295; as of March 1, 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the BRH, these bodies with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since, after the accession of these ten countries to the European Community, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These employees do not fulfil the conditions laid down in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work carried out.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill in a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the Agency or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual taxpayer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, The following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, The following five (or four) digits are the identification number for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on request, if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-Community supplies in his VAT registrations or in his annual VAT declaration.
The USt-IdNr. Is composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g., if he stops doing business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (the predisposition of all financial years) or 2. if the financial management determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at that time.
According to the value added tax law (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay sales tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting sales tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 Euroand 2. is unlikely to exceed the amount of 50,000 Euroin the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and file an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He is then allowed to charge the sales tax and deduct the pre-tax.
Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and refrain from deducting VAT.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the excess of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences can occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically request the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both NKÚ and BRH found that the German two-tier registration system could lead to significant misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which provides a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows an accurate assessment of the value added tax for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules should be harmonised for the whole EC.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person starts a business, the competent FA will apply for a commercial tax identification number that serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
International carriage of passengers by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT applies even if the transport is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are subject to tax in their own country.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as subject to VAT.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or until the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b (1) of the UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person moves through Germany, the part of the transport that is attributable to Germany is considered to be a taxable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each bus and coach named in the taxpayer's application.
The entrepreneur has to declare his taxable transport services in a German VAT declaration.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA.
If the transport service is provided to a domestic operator, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer, which is referred to as "the transfer of the tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return in respect of taxable passenger transports:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups submit an inspection report to the responsible FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out in the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the legally established turnover tax, the FA may request assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters for checking the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the small amount of VAT on taxable passenger transports.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxpayer incurs disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for financial management.
The latter must examine foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, the time required for such an examination is higher than for a resident taxable person, although the examination is limited to the passenger transports taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial management, but also those of the other Member States, as far as he carries out passenger transports there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial services of the EC Member States concerned.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services will result in a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States, as well as between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to a turnover tax in accordance with the transport route, which is part of the German territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the relevant FA in advance.
This registers the taxable person, who must declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
The law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which collect VAT under Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the service provider is located.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise specified by the law, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form specified by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the end of the period for the filing of the VAT return. Except for this regulation, according to law No. 235/2004, the value added tax is on the import of goods. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
If, as a result, an above-average amount of deductible tax is claimed for a refund, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of the deductible, without having to make an application for it.
The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the taxable person's tax liability.
Pursuant to Section 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the right to deduct VAT can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct VAT has arisen.
At the end of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
In order to do this, however, a supplementary declaration of VAT is required.
An amendment to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT declaration only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been asserted for the first time.
A taxable person must file a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, (b) he makes corrections which do not alter the last known tax liability, but only change previous information, (c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with Section 49 of Law No 235/2004.
A taxable person may file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxable person must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts were established.
The sales tax declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The submission via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for the indication of the value of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some sections are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as taxable persons is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary notifications.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as taxable persons is compared with the information in the summary notifications of taxable persons from other EC Member States with the help of VIES.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, a credibility check of VAT returns is carried out at the FA.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior check.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No. 337/1992, the FA can repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary duties under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
The NKÚ found during its examination that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the tax payer in case of non-payment of the VAT declaration.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are required to file VAT pre-notifications will still have to file an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners, who are not obliged to pay the sales tax, have to make an annual sales tax declaration.
The taxable persons are, in principle, obliged to file a preliminary VAT registration by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the turnover tax is generated (§ 18 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act).
However, if the VAT liability is more than Euro6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to file monthly VAT pre-notifications no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The taxable person can also opt for the filing of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has received a refund of Euro6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual turnover tax is not more than Euro512, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT returns are to be made.
A resulting VAT liability is to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial management.
 (legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed expeditiously.
The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (delivery or payment) costs (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment must be made for this.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-notification period of December.
If an error is detected, the trader must file a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no "additional" VAT return.
Once the VAT return, which must be submitted by 31 May of the following year, has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-notification, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections of this VAT return to the taxpayer's advantage or disadvantage are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was issued.
After the end of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax cut or tax evasion.
Taxable persons are required to file VAT pre-notifications by electronic means.
The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return can be issued either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the tax is not certified, the taxpayer must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT pre-notifications or declarations are made, the financial management is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxpayer6.
In the event of a late levy, the taxable person may be subject to a late payment (up to 10% of the tax bill or up to an amount of Euro25,000).
In a previous audit, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not charge this delay surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ collected the delay surcharges, the amount was determined inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular in the filing of the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable sales must be stated in a separate line of the VAT declaration.
The VAT returns filed on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to which all data is electronically recorded, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically generated test notices (see 5.2).
Although the financial management only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxable persons have to file their previous applications at the latest 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be submitted no later than 31 May of the following year.
The obligation to issue an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ At the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by filing a single VAT return;
- If the taxable person reports his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the cm;
- The federal states do not share VIES data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual turnover tax declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT declaration regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This tax obligation enables the German financial administration to check compliance with the sales ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual sales tax declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company in question.
In the Czech Republic, the financial management can only check the amount of the turnover on the basis of the income tax return.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to pay the VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the duty of electronic filing of the tax return in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of Czech financial management.
Summary notifications
Filing and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No 235/2004, a trader who supplies goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes has to make corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the goods delivered is always stated in Czech currency in the Central Bank, broken down according to the VAT IdNr7, the individual taxable persons under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly period of taxation have to hand over the ZM to the local FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the detection of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM are always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, tax payers can also hand over the ZM electronically.
If a taxable person does not issue a ZM or correction ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No. 235/2004, the tax official shall ask him to surrender the ZM in question, pointing out the consequences of the non-delivery. In the event of non-monetary duties, the tax official shall be entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992.
The NKÚ found during its investigation that the FÄ mostly did not use its power to impose fines on its delinquent taxpayers.
In particular, in the case of the surrender of the ZM, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their duties, since the failure to surrender a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
Pursuant to Section 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Amending ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of non-conformity
8 of the information in the ZM with which The taxable person corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- The taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- The tax official has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax officer, without the taxpayer having made a correction, do not replace the duty of the tax payer to make a correction, but only lead to the correction of the data in the VIES, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the CMMs will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT is allowed to transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the "O_MCTL" message is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt IdNr. Specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect USt-IdNr. Is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is entered in the list of false USt-IdNr.
The list contains a "report of doubts concerning USt-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return specified for it.
Selected cases of differences between the value of the purchases made by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and the value of the goods supplied by the supplier from the other Member State in his VAT return will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The clerks there must investigate the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
A) The value indicated by the Czech buyer in the relevant sections of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can be caused either by a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or by a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer in the meantime gives an additional VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax official to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
C) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods supplied by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is up to the Treasury official to check the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the Treasury official gives the results of his review in ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 from graph no. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO has decreased for the individual quarters of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on a fault of the domestic buyer.
There may also be an error on the part of the taxpayer in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that in the individual EC Member States, certain types of supplies are indicated differently in the CMD.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the audited business transactions are shown in Table 1.
Filing and processing of the summary notifications in Germany
Traders who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or take part in triangular transactions are required to make quarterly ZMs listing intra-Community deliveries to purchasers (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be surrendered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the filing of VAT pre-notifications, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
The electronic levy has been mandatory since 1 January 2007.
The competent FA may allow exemptions for individual taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the taxpayer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to issue a correction ZM within one month.
In the case of non-delivery of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, with the threat of a penalty payment and - setting the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows the imposition of a penalty payment of up to 25,000 Euro (§ 329 AO), the CLO imposes three penalty payments of 125, 250 and 500 Euro.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG states that the taxable person acts in a disorderly manner if, intentionally or frivolously, he does not give a ZM properly, completely or in a timely manner or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in a timely manner.
This breach can be punishable by a fine of up to Euro5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ into the VIES, because only the CLO is responsible for the processing of the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary reports is only available to the FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in VIES).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID number in the ZM of German taxpayers, the German CLO receives a notification "O_MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the USt IdNr. At the request of the CLO.
However, remembering, threatening and fixing up to three successive penalty payments takes too much time when a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were ultimately reported to the competent authorities, were usually closed within one to two months.
The relevant FA denied tax exemption for reported intra-Community supplies in 73% of these cases9.
If the taxpayer presented the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to hand over a corrected VAT number to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the VIES data itself.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the surrender of the corrected ZM.
As the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information given in the VAT pre-notifications or the VAT declaration on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ, which is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT check.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of employment taxation in the Federal Republic of Germany.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be issued and sent to the competent authority.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all tax payers will be drawn up later and forwarded to the tax office.
The risk management system (RMS) for the predisposition procedure then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system checks in full (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the pre-tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must surrender a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community supplies reported by the taxable persons in the Central Tax Office will be compared with the values of intra-Community supplies indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the tax assessment.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to pay quarterly VAT within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, taxable persons have had to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the taxable persons in the ZM only declare the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the taxable person reported the correct VAT ID number to the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxpayers in their VAT registrations with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-notification and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO forwards the VIES data to other Member States.
On the basis of these findings by the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted VIES data.
The data provided by other Member States on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods indicated by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations are sent to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control will only be carried out on taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons if the RMS produces an audit report or if the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for any differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular VIES, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to surrender monthly ZMs.
The monthly levy would only increase the administrative burden insignificantly, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to file monthly VAT returns or pre-notifications and for which ZM no more information is required than for VAT returns or pre-notifications.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the levying of the ZM could be linked to the filing of VAT returns or pre-notifications.
However, an obligation to provide ZM on a monthly basis would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community purchases and increase the flow of data between CLOs.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZMs.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transmission of VIES data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to provide ZM on a monthly basis to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly fee at European level, so that a monthly update of the VIES data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both auditors requested data on the number of false tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O_MCTL reports, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
These data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its numbers to the calendar quarter in which O_MCTL was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who have exported them.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standardised SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFIs or their responses to a received RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO, which translates the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and forwards it to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the responses to requests sent. It provides for their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the competent authorities for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no answer had been sent to Germany until the examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to the requests made by Germany can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, a response was received in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period, and in 19 cases no response was received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case could not be determined on the basis of the declared information). When Germany answered the request for information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information were mostly worth more than Euro60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
The tax officials of other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the value added tax liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals, without prior request.
"structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another Member State, without its prior request, as soon as the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States of the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The financial officer obtains this information from the pre-printed notification of the delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to Section 19 of Law No. 235/2004, as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the financial directorate, where the data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."
This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form of spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.
The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is one-size-fits-all.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of employment in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries specified in the request exceeds the minimum amount of Euro15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO is concerned with the translation of freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [ (B1-17) or (E) ], if they are not written in German or English.
In order to answer the request for information, the CLO directs it to the responsible FA and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of German financial management.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ of answering the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ will receive the required information by writing to the taxpayer or conducting an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special sales tax audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called sales tax review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
This short and flexible form of examination does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proved its worth in the examination of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany provides the other Member State with the following information: - via USt-IdNr., which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of VAT to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC Member States in the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The supply of new vehicles to traders without UStIdNr., b. distance selling (shipping) to other EC Member States not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community supplies of goods subject to taxation by the taxable person in Germany, e. potential "Missing Traders" which have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as for taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have misused a VAT ID number.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities, who send the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information provided into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information in a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration handled 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information sent to Germany were only dealt with by the German financial administration in 40.6% of the cases within that period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the absence of memories, there is a high proportion of time-limited requests for information.
That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities to respond to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of sales tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organizational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The department of methodology and economic management of sales tax, or its risk management unit, deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the VIES data to detect possible tax evasions in the context of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates risk-prone goods, prepares conceptual risk management in the area of sales tax and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the VIES system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The Tax Examination and Tax Investigation Department conducts, among other things, risk analyses in the context of the methodical control of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from financial management and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation bodies exist in the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for taxpayers and sectors that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g., Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxpayers (e.g., in the sectors of Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in chain fraud cases and the information of the local financial authorities.
Special testing units have been set up in 12 selected cases.
They have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, especially in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of the tax investigators or concentrate on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with particularly high turnovers.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk of tax returns, - the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited," selecting the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria - the task of "MIAS" which allows tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task of "MIAS" allows, among other things: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID of taxable persons from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable person from other Member States, - creation of a list of taxable persons who have not surrendered a ZM, - formal control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their ZM. before this information is sent to other Member States - drawing up a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns the information on goods delivered to other Member States does not match the information in the CMD - drawing up a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns the information on the value of goods purchased from other Member States does not match the information in the CMD of all their suppliers from other Member States13.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, business registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Dispensing and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial authorities of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and implementation of a RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
It is true that there are joint working groups for development, but neither the CLO nor the financial authorities of the federal states have a complete uniform database.
At the level of the CLO, the unit ST I 2 (hereafter "KUSS" - Coordinating Unit for special sales tax audits and tax investigation measures) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS, where the tax authorities can enter and query the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. Of other Member States, which appear in the ZM of German taxpayers, will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the VIES data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity check in the USt-IdNr., referred to in the ZM, is carried out on the basis of the O_MCTL identifiers sent by the other Member States (for the procedure for the correction of invalid USt-IdNr., see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on the VIES data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the discovery of suspected Missing Traders, using certain characteristics that usually occur in carousel transactions.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The audit by the BRH has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other factors, such as the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the industry or the company's shareholdings.
A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system draws up a list of those taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT pre-notification or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete surrender of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the taxable person in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the VIES.
The financial authorities of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as this would result in too many discrepancies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- Suppliers and purchasers assume different timings for the execution of intra-Community sales;
- Different accounting records and tax declarations of Skonti and rebates.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the VIES data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g., company name, age of the owner/participant, number of employees and mode of payment of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a rules-based risk management system that allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.
This system is used in the processing of VAT pre-registrations by the FÄ.
This will give the responsible FA the advice of the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the fae.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their findings so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it has proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other evidence, this Neuro-Fuzzy system (also known as the data-mining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is entangled in tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ selects the taxable persons concerned for examination and reports the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMSs is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears fit for purpose.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will materialise in actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national problem, but an European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for a RMS need to be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this is not the case, fraudsters will seek out the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is located.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be an European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual sales As part of the parallel examinations, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or services.
Which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial authorities of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, which were in doubt about their implementation, or which the taxpayers of both states stated differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, NKÚ examined a total of eight business transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of communications from the BRH, NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany indicated by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different procedures for registration in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the VIES data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth Euro60,500 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only Euro29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany for the purpose of verifying the value of the goods delivered.
The German side stated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German taxpayer in question had delivered goods worth Euro27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, Euro31,997 in the third quarter and Euro10,276 in the fourth quarter.
It also emerged from the reply that the VAT ID of the German taxpayer was not valid until 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had accepted another application from the German taxpayer and brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (inter-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
Through a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech taxpayer had issued additional VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of pre-tax from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
Je-doch had not applied for the allocation of an USt-IdNr., but only a tax number applicable to Germany at the time of registration.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a VAT ID number to a taxable person, in 2006 the competent clerk of the German financial administration did so retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO retroactively allocates an USt-IdNr. If the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g., if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer's request for the grant of an USt-IdNr.
In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. Retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not need a valid USt-IdNr. For an intra-Community delivery according to § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID of its supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted USt-IdNr. Retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for a review of the German businessman's registration tax.
According to the VIES data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities announced that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but had not been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons.
By request from the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT check on the Czech taxable person for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this examination, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 that he had provided to the German taxpayer prior to his registration (i.e. Before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office imposed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 on the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had not been allocated the VAT ID number until he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for the purposes of sales tax, in order to be able to monitor the filing of the sales tax declaration for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxable person declared intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160 Euro (about 5,000 CZK).
3. In its VAT declaration for September 2004 as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported goods deliveries worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxpayer.
When reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the VIES system, the Czech tax official stated that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the delivery of goods to Germany.
The Czech tax payer issued a supplementary VAT declaration stating sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted a request for the resumption of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered since January 1, 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official reviewed the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to the German information, the German taxpayer was not allocated a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official dismissed the request to resume the tax procedure.
The BRH found that there had been no intra-Community acquisition of goods in this case because the German taxpayer had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
The German recipient, however, declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the value-added tax, and also demanded the reimbursement of pre-taxes at the same rate.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT declaration.
The BRH also found that the company of the German taxpayer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.
This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxpayer from a German taxpayer worth Euro22,686.
Through a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had examined in the course of an external examination with the Czech taxpayer whether the intra-EU supply had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had recorded and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-EU purchase in his VAT return because the German supplier did not indicate his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the VIES data, the German taxpayer is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax payer, so that he could initiate a corresponding tax procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the purchase of goods from a non-business (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a sales tax for the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a taxable person who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community supplies in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the UStIdNr. Of the buyer in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to employment taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech finance officer took note of this business incident, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum threshold of Euro15,000:5.
According to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth Euro12,561 from a German taxpayer.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the framework of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer said that he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than Euro15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax official did not receive documentation for the ex-post taxation of the purchased goods, the tax assessment was inconclusive, and the original tax assessment was maintained.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his VAT declaration and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the ex-post taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In Section 4.6.1, it was shown that the answers given by the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers given by the Czech tax administration:
6. During its examination, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration sent a request for information on the value of deliveries of goods to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxpayer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth Euro86,307; however, the Czech taxpayer declared only the purchase of goods worth Euro35,314 for the same period in his VAT return.
In the reply to the request for information submitted to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, worth Euro1,265,554, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ found that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
Through a request to the local tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new vehicles to this German taxpayer worth CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax payer issued a corrected tax.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT check was carried out on the German buyer in Germany, where it was established that the purchase of all the cars in question had been correctly taxed, and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. According to the VIES data, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth Euro48,500 from a German taxpayer.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not file any tax returns even after the request of the tax official. Consequently, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the said delivery from the German taxpayer.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the answer to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the examination of the NKÚ how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, by means of a SCAC form, the Czech tax official asked for a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for supplies worth Euro16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.
The German purchaser declared the purchase of goods worth Euro16,335 twice in its preliminary VAT registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth Euro198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits on the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of higher than average input taxes.
However, an unwarranted claim has not been established.
The BRH found that, for the period in question, the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of Euro579.114, and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for disagreements between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's VAT return.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic discrepancies18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from VIES, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth Euro35,716 from the German taxpayer, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official asked for a review of how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech within the framework of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German financial management, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was Euro155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth Euro21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer a false confirmation of payment of Euro155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
After the discovery of the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech buyer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech clients, managed to recover the supplied material with the exception of a part worth Euro7,916.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the tax administration subsequently imposed on the Czech taxpayer, among other things, a tax on sales of goods from other Member States, amounting to CZK 388,522.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that, after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a consignment of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth Euro7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His ZM included the following information concerning Czech taxpayers:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial management asked for a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCAC form.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied goods to the German taxpayer with a total value of Euro396.126 and provided services worth Euro11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit on the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and installed a production plant for the German one.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer did not take down the assembled production plant and claimed faults.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German production plant for Euro107,100 and Euro11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the bills, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that all invoices on the books of the Czech taxpayer had been properly accounted for.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer relating to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech financial management's reply, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a single (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German assembly, including the assembly performed.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the delivery of the work owes the sales tax in accordance with the German sales tax law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction in the same amount.
As the German taxpayer's liability for turnover remained unchanged, the German FA did not issue a correction to the VAT declaration.
13. According to the VIES data, in February 2005, Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine worth Euro58,000 from the German taxpayer C.
The Czech tax official sent a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but returned it to the German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the establishment of the German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
By asking the local tax official responsible for the taxable person, the NKÚ found that, according to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer C had supplied the Czech taxpayer with goods (another machine) worth Euro88.027.
Tax payer B said he did not receive the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with the taxable person B, the tax official stated that the machine, worth Euro88.027, had not been registered with the taxable person B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German taxpayer C had delivered to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the local Czech tax official responsible for the taxable person A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The tax official had the invoice of the German taxable person C of 7 February 2005, in which the taxable person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official noted that taxable person A had not recorded this invoice.
Taxable A had signed a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxpayer A.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine, worth Euro88.027, not to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxpayer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods, but a taxable supply within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer C for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German taxpayer D supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
According to German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that the German taxpayer C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth Euro58,000 to the Czech taxpayer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below represents the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration received a request for information from Germany, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community supplies of a German taxpayer worth Euro879,680.625 to a Czech taxpayer.
The German tax official said there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German taxpayer has not been active since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit on the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company said that it was probably a claim of the German taxpayer against the German financial management, which the Czech taxpayer had made as a shareholder in the German company to the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far no information that the German tax administration is handling the case with reference to the Czech taxpayer.
According to the information available, it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.
The main reason for these disagreements was the failure to mention the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer supplied goods to a Czech taxpayer with a total value of Euro33,205.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech tax official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer, and that the other goods had been picked up personally.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted an additional VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the value of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax check with the Czech taxpayer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer had delivered goods worth Euro46,854 to a Czech taxpayer.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only Euro14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent which showed a total value of the goods delivered of Euro31,999, i.e. an amount equal to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the VIES data.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, he contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and stayed with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to discuss with the company owner the issue of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
Until now, no additional VAT declaration has been issued.
The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT fix for the relevant tax period would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth Euro11,600 to the German taxpayer.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for confirmation as to whether the above-mentioned Czech taxpayers actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had set up a number of bogus companies in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech taxpayer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as a taxable person in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in either the Czech Republic or Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech tax official provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German tax administration.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax assessment, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German taxpayer and at the same time asserted the right of deduction for the purchase from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT declaration, he did not declare a sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration issued after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official came to the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which revealed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of sales tax worth Euro1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA, which is responsible for the actual recipient of the goods, to ensure that the resale of those goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community supplies that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a car worth Euro47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
A copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer was attached to the request for information.
As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and said that he had no contacts with a German taxpayer.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxpayer does not have his seat at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the company's managing director cannot be reached.
Following a tax redress procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German tax official had rejected the German taxpayer's claim to exempt this supply from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of Euro3,000 between the value of the purchased goods specified in the VAT declaration and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth Euro89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not comply with the VIES data, the German tax official asked for the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax payer issued a VAT declaration and a ZM, which was signed by a person not authorised to do so, namely this shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax official that the owner of the capital had paid the payment received for the goods invoiced in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts have not been issued.
Through a request to the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax official recognised the Czech taxpayer's right to VAT exemption for supplies of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT declaration of the German buyer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed value-added tax debt.
20. According to the VIES data, in 2005, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth Euro4,251,196, according to which he had purchased goods worth Euro43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions either in his 2004 sales tax declaration or in the one for 2005.
In addition, it did not declare any initial sales in terms of value.
Due to these disagreements, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community supplies of goods for a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial management stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representatives).
From the documents provided to NKÚ by the competent tax official, it can be seen that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the start of the audit of turnover for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the tax official to provide all accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech taxpayer has not issued any turnover tax returns since April 2006.
In the context of the parallel examination, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do taxable business in Germany.
On the basis of this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf of, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German taxpayer (UDE) resident in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the receiver is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the State of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community supplies either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation would be required from at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT returns and the VIES data caused by the different legislation in 2004.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for taxpayers and the tax authorities to apply the new legislation:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer reported goods deliveries to a German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 792,977,452.
During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in his ZM for a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that both were electricity supplies.
Both Czech taxable persons took into account the above supplies in their domestic accounts in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004, applicable in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 different legal regulations concerning the supply and purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, taxable persons declared the supply of electrical energy as an intra-Community supply of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legislation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal regulations were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635/2004, which changed some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community supplies or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxable person declared intra-Community supplies for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to a German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community supplies for the same period to another German taxpayer with a value of CZK 263.470.776.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that in both cases it had been the supply of electrical energy.
In accordance with the provisions of Law No 235/2004, applicable from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, his place of business or his place of business for which the delivery is made.
For this reason, the Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881.939 in VIES.
Concluding remarks
Through cooperation, the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ have been achieved.
Both courts of auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legislation governing VAT administration.
During the parallel examinations, there were interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
Some of them are worth watching.
On the basis of the audit results, both courts of auditors drew up recommendations on the management of sales tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two courts of auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the area of VAT administration.
