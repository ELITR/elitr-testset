Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of VAT in the Czech Republic and Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the auditors have the power to audit the entire public finances.
The declaration requires that the auditors have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.
The Organization of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the Sixth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the auditing of public revenues by the auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of an auditor is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, there can be a situation in which national auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the auditors of other states.
As an example, the audit of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Auditors in this area must be prepared to work closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of VAT and the MIAS system was developed at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating auditors first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the test subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only help to improve the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of VAT in the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Case number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(De) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures used by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.
(De) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT, in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Justice ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the utilisation of information obtained through international mutual assistance between financial administrations and the comparison of sales tax management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the tests was prepared in accordance with the European guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI exam standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two auditors.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of sales tax administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among other things, the key criterion for registering is exceeding the turnover threshold set out in the VAT law.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number valid only for domestic sales for the purposes of VAT.
If the German tax collector wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is tax-free, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to sales tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation under Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic, taxable income tax returns only have to be issued for under-year tax periods (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Advance sales tax filings and a return on sales tax after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany are required to submit VAT advance applications electronically.
The introduction of the electronic levy of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax authorities (fä), German tax authorities have to submit the summary reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, in the Czech Republic, the information from the summary reports will be available immediately after their submission.
In German, the information from the summary messages is only available after their processing by the Clo.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community sales is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of turnover and the updating of MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely review of taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
In case of requests for information, the Czech Clo will monitor compliance with the three-month period.
The German Clo does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the specified period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German Clo be constantly monitored (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
As part of the cooperation, the two auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using the legal options of the Clo, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The auditors found that:
In some cases, the fä used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the tax authorities concerned.
In these cases, the tax-payers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or failed to declare the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the fä could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused to provide the information requested.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax payers incorrectly reported sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly faulty, so that in these cases, the technical staff (the FA) had to investigate (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Examination Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 departments Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of NKÚ approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the Traffic Tax Examination Unit and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the audit in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the Clo, the exam was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following subjects were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe City, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich bodies, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover North, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, discussions were held with the fä Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the exam were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held by representatives of both auditors.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the financial administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in each other's country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel tests: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of financial officials in the processing of requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the sales tax area.
At a meeting to vote on the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests that had already been achieved.

On the first day of the third month after the month in which he crossed the threshold, an entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000, will be eligible for payment (§ 94 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004 Coll., on VAT; hereinafter "Law No 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxable person if he has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic, who provides tax-deductible services or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other requirements set out in Law No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with legal headquarters, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, can voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
When the application for registration is received by the local financial officer, the registration process begins in accordance with Law No 337 / 1992.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you have to specify in your application the deadline from which you apply for registration as a VAT collector.
The financial officer has to check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information contained in it, he has to ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
If the financial officer has verified that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he has to give a written notification of the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the financial officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the investment period for the VAT.
The investment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the predisposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the investment period and has to inform the financial officer of this change.
The issuing of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The taxable person must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the financial officer, and also in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235 / 2004 concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The control number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or any other general identification mark, as far as a special law determines it. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No. 337 / 1992).
If, despite a request from the financial officer, the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligations, the local financial officer has to register him on his behalf.
A notification will also be issued to the taxman.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur admitted to doing business will receive a tax number for any type of tax when they first register.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
In accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the VAT registration requirement, the tax officer can demand that the taxable person receive up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover, which the person concerned has made unlawfully without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person, until the date on which the registration as a taxable person was made by the financial officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
The payment of the fixed amount is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or a fine.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a taxable person can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of the registration at the request of the taxable person, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
A tax collector can request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) deletion of registration on the grounds of office (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004), if: A) the taxable person has not performed in the period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the financial officer of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004, c) the previous taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements for tax treatment.
B) A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic with no legal place of business, place of business or place of business, or a tax-exempt foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to make a tax return and pay taxes ("non-resident entrepreneur") for these services or supplies in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235 / 2004, will be tax-exempt with the provision of the service in question.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
In this application, he is required to indicate all UST IDs allocated to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 FA will have to register him retrospectively, as he became taxable on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, in accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004.
In the event of a retroactive registration, the Prague 1 FA will have to request proof of performance from the companies concerned (invoices or written explanations).
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the Prague 1 FA will have to ask for the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of January 31 of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax filings or returns and to pay tax.
When examining the NKÚ, it turned out that, in the event of a tax return being issued by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident company for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax code (§ § 137, 138 AO), any business must be registered with the municipality and / or the relevant tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after the start of business.
The municipality will forward the application to the tax authorities.
If the relevant tax office finds that a business activity has been started but has not been registered, it can also retroactively register the taxable person from its office.
In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are required to register for Zwekke for VAT if they meet the requirements set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Foreign entrepreneurs have special responsibilities.
For example, for those entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic, the ChemnitzSüd FA is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with the company; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the findings of the Federal Republic of Germany, these companies with special responsibilities frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since, after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These self-employed persons do not meet the conditions set out in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work they perform.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill out a questionnaire from the relevant FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all fä in Germany.
It will be processed either in special organisational units within the fä or in the organisational units generally responsible for the tax assessment.
With the help of this pressure, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual taxpayer before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the relevant FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the controller, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the Clo on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the Clo when the taxable person declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-registration or in his annual VAT return.
The UST ID number is composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he ceases to do business), but only after the completion of all tax procedures (predisposition of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the fä must inform the Clo of the deletion of the VAT number, so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at this time.
According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax-payers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting sales tax has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. In the following year the amount of €50,000 is unlikely to exceed.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and make an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the VAT and deduct the VAT.
Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two countries is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold amount specified in the VAT law.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration process in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable person will receive a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes will receive a tax number exclusively for domestic sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community sales, he has to apply specifically for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which provides a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community sales, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxable person does not register his business with the municipality or the relevant FA.
This retroactive registration allows an accurate estimate of the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the sales tax debt.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be standardised.
The German Parliament recently approved the introduction of a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxation to every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up a business activity, the relevant FA will apply for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
Legislation in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to a deduction.
The exemption from VAT applies even if the transport is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable domestically.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as taxable in the Czech Republic.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b), as stated in the text:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic, in accordance with paragraph 17 of Annex F of the Directive, can either maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport until the requirement of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal requirements in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person is transported through Germany, the part of the transport that falls on Germany is considered taxable.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each of the buses mentioned in the application of the taxable person.
The entrepreneur must provide his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA.
If the transport service is provided for a domestically based entrepreneur, the non-resident taxman does not have to pay the sales tax himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic buyer of the services has to pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident taxpayer, which is referred to as the "transfer of tax liability" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax collector and his income tax return, the German financial administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each test, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can ask the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxable person can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out in the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally set VAT, the FA may ask for assistance under Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters to be too costly in relation to the low income from VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the books of a non-resident taxable person incurs disproportionately high costs for the taxable person himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine foreign books, which require knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit can be expected to involve a higher amount of time than a resident taxable person, although the audit is limited to passenger transport in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must not only accept the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States where he carries out passenger transport.
In addition, for each Member State in which only one passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must meet all existing tax requirements in the various languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the financial administrations of the relevant EC Member States.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services will result in a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Czech Republic's Act of Accession to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the route of transport that is to be carried out on German territory.
If, for the first time, a non-resident tax collector provides such a transport service, he must first register it with the relevant FA.
This registers the taxable person who must declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax-payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The amount of tax in question is quite low relative to the administrative burden.
The Member States - which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant amount of tax.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the service provider is based.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Levy and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise specified by the law, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur will be required to file a VAT return on the pre-print provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period.
The tax liability will be incurred at the end of the period for issuing the VAT return. Exempt from this rule is the VAT on the import of goods in accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004. Here, the due date of the tax is determined in accordance with the customs regulations.
If there is a claim for reimbursement as a result of above-average deductible taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of setting this deduction without having to make an application for it.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the financial officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the taxable person.
According to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduct taxes can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct taxes was created.
At the end of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Act 235 / 2004, which came into force on 1 January 2005, allows the levy of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the claim for a deduction could have been claimed for the first time.
A tax collector must make a supplementary VAT return if: A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax debt, b) he makes corrections by which the last known tax debt is not changed, but only previous information is changed, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax debt in accordance with Section 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax collector can issue a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxable person must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month, which follows the month in which the facts in question were established.
The sales tax declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carriers.
The delivery via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary checks within the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to persons registered as taxable in other EC Member States is compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summary reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered as taxable there is compared with the information in the summary reports of taxable persons from other EC Member States with the help of the MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA will carry out a credibility assessment of the sales tax returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior audit.
The credibility assessment includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of the sales tax returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No. 337 / 1992, the FA can repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its audit, the NKÚ found that the fä rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person in question if the VAT return was not issued.
Levy and processing of sales tax returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly sales tax filings and annual sales tax returns.
However, those taxable persons who are ploughed into paying VAT pre-registration must make an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not ploughed into paying VAT will have to make an annual sales tax return.
The tax-payers are, in principle, obliged to submit a VAT advance notification by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is generated (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, in the previous year, if the VAT debt is more than €6,136, or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur will be required to file monthly VAT advance applications at the latest by the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The taxable person can also opt for the levy of monthly VAT pre-registration if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual sales tax is no more than €512, neither sales tax declarations nor sales tax declarations must be made.
A resulting VAT debt must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial management.
(Statutory) deadlines for processing VAT returns and for refunding VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
In principle, sales tax returns, including refunds, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (levy or payment) periods (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the levy of VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made a month later, but in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT debt established for the pre-registration period in December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance notice.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the sales tax return submitted to the tax office by 31 May of the following year has been submitted, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance notification, but only the incorrect annual sales tax return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was issued.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a sales tax return can usually only be corrected in cases of a light-hearted tax cut or tax evasion.
The tax-payers must submit the VAT advance applications electronically.
The fä can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
The annual sales tax return can be issued either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the taxman must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
In the event that no VAT advance declarations or declarations are made, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax-payer 6.
In the event of a late levy, the taxable person can be charged a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax debt or up to €25,000).
In an earlier review, the BRH found that the fä often do not charge this late surcharge.
In the cases in which the fä levied the late surcharges, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, particularly when issuing the annual sales tax return.
The preprint of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable sales must be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The sales tax returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Once all data is collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible person on the basis of the automatically drawn up audit notes (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, the tax payers have to file their advance applications no later than 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual sales tax declaration must be made by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The plan to issue an annual sales tax return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxable person can correct the errors in the monthly advance registrations by submitting a single VAT return;
- if the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The federal states do not match MIAS data on intra-Community purchases of German tax collectors until the annual sales tax returns are usually processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy allows the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover cap for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can match the annual sales tax declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only check the level of turnover on the basis of the income tax return issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax-payers are ploughed into the electronic levy of VAT pre-registration.
The introduction of the levy on electronic tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary notifications
Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit corresponding summary notices (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the UST-IdNr7, the individual taxable persons under whom they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period have to hand over the ZM to the local FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in an Amending ZM within 15 days of finding the error.
Faulty data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, the tax payers can also hand over the ZM electronically.
If a tax collector does not issue a ZM or Amending ZM, although he is required to do so by law no. 235 / 2004, the financial officer has to ask him to hand over the relevant ZM, pointing out the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-payment of non-monetary payments, the financial officer has the power to repeatedly impose fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with section 37 of law no. 337 / 1992.
In its audit, the NKÚ found that the fä mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax payers.
In particular, in the case of the ZM levy, the tax-payers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to levy a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT debt.
In accordance with Section 102 (5) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is required to check the information in the ZM or amending ZM, to remove any ambiguity and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxman corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting an amending ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the controller does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or Amending ZM) and therefore corrects it by issuing an Amending ZM;
- the financial officer has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM or Amending ZM.
Notifications entered by the financial officer, without any corrective ZM being issued by the tax-payer, do not replace the tax-payer's pledge to provide a corrective ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are current, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the Clo (in the Czech Republic, this function is carried out by the Department of International Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance), and the "O _ MCTL" message is automatically sent to the Clo from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect UST IDs specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect UST ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry in the list of the wrong UST ID number is made.
The list contains a "Notice of doubt concerning UST-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return for that purpose.
Selected cases of differences between the value of the purchases made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and the value of the goods delivered by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the Clo to the competent FA for examination.
The staff there must investigate the discrepancies.
There can then be three different situations:
A) The value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can be caused either by a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or by a change in the information in the sales tax return (the Czech tax collector, meanwhile, makes a supplementary sales tax return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information in the sales tax return.
C) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods delivered by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
This, in turn, is the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer submits the results of his review to ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the Clo.
The number of transactions sent by the Clo for examination can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 in Figure 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases transmitted by the Clo has decreased for each quarter of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number of cases in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech Clo has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic buyer.
There may also be an error of the taxable person in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the ZM are given differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the audited cases can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must hand over ZM quarterly, which lists intra-Community deliveries to purchasers (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a permanent extension is granted for the levy of VAT pre-registration, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the Clo.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.
The FA responsible can allow exemptions for individual tax havens in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
If the taxman finds that the ZM was faulty, he will be ploughed into submission of an Amending ZM within a month.
If the ZM is not handed over, the Clo will initiate an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be imposed and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows a penalty of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO) to be set, the Clo sets penalties of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 of the German Civil Code (UStG) stipulates that the taxable person acts in an unlawful manner if he intentionally or lightly fails to deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This offence can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the fä, because the Clo is exclusively responsible for the processing of the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the Clo.
The information from the summary messages is only available to the fä after their processing by the Clo.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID number in the ZM of German taxpayers, the German Clo will receive a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The Clo then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the Clo fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then up to him to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID number at the request of the Clo.
However, the memory, the threat and the imposition of up to three consecutive fines, takes too much time when a tax collector may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were ultimately reported to the relevant authorities, were usually closed within one to two months.
The FA, which is responsible for each case, refused to grant the tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.
If the taxman presented the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the Clo because the FA could not correct the MIAS data itself.
The BRH found that neither the fä nor the Clo controlled the levy of the corrected ZM.
As the Clo does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information provided in the VAT advance reports or the VAT return on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is sent to the Clo of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the fä, which is usually done in preparation for a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the Clo.
Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used to control labour market taxation in the fä.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the Clo with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be prepared and sent to the relevant subject.
This happens on an ongoing basis, whereas a dissemination of the acquisition data of all persons subject to VAT will be produced later and forwarded to the fä.
The Risk Management System (RMS) for the investment process then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system checks in full (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State will have to hand over a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The fä process the ZM and forward the data to the Clo.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxable persons in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the context of the tax setting.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to pay quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have had to submit the ZM electronically to the Clo.
The data from the ZM are only available to the fä after their processing at the Clo.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the tax payers in the ZM only provide the goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech fä, the German fä cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the ZM.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect UST ID numbers were not corrected even if the controller informed the FA of the correct UST ID number.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German tax-payers in their VAT pre-registration with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German Clo transfers the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings by the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
In the Czech Republic, the data provided by other Member States on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers is compared with the data on the purchases of goods provided by Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech Clo makes the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations will be referred to the fä for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control will only be carried out in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to the deduction.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons if the RMS produces an audit report or if the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the fä from clarifying the reasons for any differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of ZM, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax-payers had to hand over monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, as most tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already ploughed into issuing monthly sales tax returns or pre-registrations, and no more information is required for the ZM than for the sales tax returns or pre-registrations.
In order to avoid red tape, the levy of the ZM could be linked to the levy of sales tax declarations or advance declarations.
However, a levy on the monthly levy of ZM would create more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community purchases, and would increase the flow of data between the Clo.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the Clo of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order to have an effect on the monthly levy of ZM, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both auditors requested data on the number of false tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL notifications, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the audited quarters.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different basis for calculating the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech Clo refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German Clo refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL was reported.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax payers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: The exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information (English: Request for information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic will send their RFI or their replies to a RFI received by the Finance Directorate to the Clo, which will be responsible for translating the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and forwarding it to the other Member States.
In addition, the Clo receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and answers to requests sent. It provides for their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the relevant subject for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFI exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFI received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%), this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ had examined it. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to requests made by Germany can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, a response was received in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases no response had yet been received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information on the basis of the information provided).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic and Germany were answered can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover reported in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information were mostly worth more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials in other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT debt.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the Clo.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to another Member State without its prior request, once the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No. 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer will enter the required data into the relevant document template and forward it directly to the responsible employee of the Finance Directorate, where the data will be collected and sent to the Clo for further processing, after which the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."
This information will be transmitted to the other Member States via an SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.
The fä send the completed form SCAC 2004 by email directly to the German Clo, which forwards the SCACPreprints to the foreign Clo.
The fä are instructed to submit their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACVordruck used is in German.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the Federal Republic of Germany were sent in order to ensure income tax in the other Member State or to prove the tax freedom of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German Clo receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount of €15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German Clo refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum threshold.
In addition, the German Clo provides for the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are neither written in German nor in English.
In response to the request for information, the Clo directs it to the relevant FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German Clo has the technical means to monitor the keeping of deadlines, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FA of the unfinished requests for information.
The fä receive the required information by writing to the controller or conducting an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: The special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
In this short and flexible form of audit, it is not necessary to make an announcement to the taxable person, and it has proved its worth in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany will send the following information to the other Member State: - on VAT, which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the reimbursement of VAT to companies established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has pledged to provide the following information to the other EU Member States as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of items that have been improperly taxed by the taxable person in Germany, e. Potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their UStID number is still valid or has already been deleted, and f. Taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "Missing Traders" or to customers who have improperly used a VAT number.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information and / or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities, who transmit the relevant SCAC forms to the Clo.
While the Czech Clo uses bilingual SCACPreprints (Czech-English) and translates the information provided into English or German, the German ones follow the instruction to submit requests for information or spontaneous information in a monolingual form only in German.
The German Clo does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information sent to Germany were only handled by the German financial administration in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German Clo points to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of requests for information that are answered on time.
That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German Clo.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German Clo is now reminding the tax authorities of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Administration of Value Added Tax, or its Risk Management Unit, is looking at identifying potential risk factors for tax revenue and evaluating trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates risky goods, conceptually prepares risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Assistance in the field of VAT provides, among other things, for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Tax Audit and Tax Investigation Methodology Department conducts risk analyses, among other things, within the framework of the methodical management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, produces risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from financial management and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigators are in charge of the financial directorates. Their tasks include searching for tax-dodgers and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searching for unregistered tax-dodgers (e.g. in the Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), investigating links in chain fraud cases and informing local financial authorities.
Special exam units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.
They have a regional competence and carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the fä, on the basis of appropriate authorisation.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax dodgers with certain activities, multinational companies and tax dodgers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk effectiveness of tax returns issued; - the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited," selecting the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAS," which allows financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task enables, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of taxable persons from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable person in question from other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not provided ZM, - formal control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxable persons whose VAT returns do not match the information on goods delivered to other Member States with the information provided in the ZM, - preparation of a list of taxable persons whose tax returns are not in accordance with the value of the other Member States, the information on the value of the goods obtained from their suppliers in the other Member States.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from state authorities such as the Commercial Register, Land Registry, Motor Vehicle Registry, Trade Registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 of the Comprehensive Notices in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the Clo) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the Clo nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete set of data.
At the level of the Clo, the unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as the "Kuss" - Coordination Unit for Special Sales Tax Examinations and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up for the kiss, where the tax authorities can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or sales tax fraudsters.
The Kuss coordinates related cases of VAT fraud at the national level as well as cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the kiss is brought into the development of the RMS through their cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the Clo and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT numbers of other Member States, which appear in the ZM of German tax authorities, will be carried out at the Clo.
This formal review will take place prior to the transfer of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the UST ID number mentioned in the ZM will be assessed on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers provided by the other Member States (for the procedure of correcting invalid UST ID numbers, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the Clo's RMS relies on the MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of communications for the discovery of suspected Missing Traders, using certain characteristics that usually occur in carousel transactions as clues.
Federal prosecutors are instructed to process these communications and, in certain cases, have to forward the outcome of their investigations to the Clo.
The BRH's audit has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other clues, such as the payment behaviour of the tax-payer, the business sector or the company's shareholding relationships.
A second level of risk management is provided by the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of sales tax filings and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of those taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT advance or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the Clo to monitor the full delivery of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions given by the taxable person in his annual sales tax return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as it would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- Suppliers and purchasers expect different times for the execution of intra-Community sales;
- different accounting and tax declarations of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the sales tax returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the sales tax returns and certain other clues (e.g. company word, age of the owner / shareholder, number of employees and method of payment of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way as to identify suspected tax fraudsters.
This system is used in the processing of VAT advance notices.
This will give the relevant FA the advice of the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers have to adjust the rules according to feedback from the fä.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of uncovered cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system creates a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities will decide on the audit of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, the auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the datamining system) calculates how likely a tax collector is to be involved in tax fraud.
It then creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the subjects select the relevant tax authorities for examination and report the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the desired effects will materialise in actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
While it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - particularly carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State, and if this does not happen, fraudsters will seek out the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud can be affected.
This is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales As part of the parallel audits, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries, respectively.
Acquisitions that were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two jurisdictions jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, which were in doubt about their implementation, or which the tax authorities of both states explained differently in the tax returns or in the ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ investigated a total of eight business incidents between eight Czech and eight German tax authorities.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, as indicated by Czech tax authorities in their tax returns and ZM, on the basis of information provided by the BRH.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the Clo.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax collector.
When the Czech taxpayer declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech financial administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In its response to the Czech request for information, the German side said that the German taxpayer in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the 2nd quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and goods worth €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
The answer also revealed that the VAT ID number of the German taxable person was not valid until 28 September 2004, but the German Clo had accepted another request from the German taxable person and had retroactively brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number as of 1 May 2004.
The German tax authority corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
In a request to the relevant tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech taxable person had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-age) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States, while at the same time seeking the deduction of VAT from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional sales tax declarations, the competent representative of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared acquisitions also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered in September 2003 as subject to sales tax.
At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number that was finally valid for Germany.
Although in Germany it is usually not possible to retroactively allocate a VAT ID number to a taxable person, in 2006 the responsible person in charge of the German financial administration did so retroactively on 1 May 2004.
The German Clo retrospectively allocates a VAT ID number if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; for example, if the Clo caused the delay following the request of the taxable person to grant a VAT ID number.
In this case, the Clo retroactively grants the VAT ID number, because the entrepreneur does not need a valid VAT ID number for an intra-community delivery, according to § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of its supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Due to these procedural differences between the Member States, the German Clo retroactively granted the VAT ID number in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the German entrepreneur's sales tax registration.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their response, the German authorities announced that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons had only been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany on 16 February 2005.
Through a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ learned that the financial officer had carried out a VAT audit on the Czech taxable person for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxable person had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German taxable person prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) Tax Office fixed a tax debt of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 in relation to the Czech taxpayer.
On the basis of the NKÚ request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had only been allocated the VAT ID number when he applied to the FA on 16 February 2005 for his company, which was founded in 2004.
In addition, the FA retroactively registered him from 1 October 200415 for the purposes of VAT, in order to be able to monitor the levy of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxable person indicated intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic worth 160 €(approx. 5,000 CZK).
3. In his VAT return for September 2004 as well as in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector gave goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax collector.
When reviewing the registration of the German taxable person in the MIAS system, the Czech financial officer found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and therefore after the goods were delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax collector issued a supplementary sales tax return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxman subsequently submitted a request for the resumption of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return, as evidence he submitted a confirmation from the German financial administration that the German taxable person had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech financial officer reviewed the validity of the registration of the German taxable person in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to the German information, the German taxpayer was not assigned a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech finance official rejected the request to reopen the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place, because the German taxable person had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German beneficiary explained both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the VAT on it, and also demanded the reimbursement of taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the German tax payer's tax liability, the German financial officer did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German taxman mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax authorities.
This change in the name of the German taxman also confused the Czech financial officer.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial officer reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax collector from a German tax collector worth €22,686.
In a request to the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had examined, in the course of an external audit with the Czech tax authority, whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxman had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax collector did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his sales tax return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person will not be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community sales until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable person.
The Czech finance official also requested that the German financial administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax collector, so that he could, if necessary, initiate an appropriate tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose VAT on the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a taxable person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such deliveries.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, according to German tax law, turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to income tax in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German Clo rejects requests for information on intra-Community sales if they are below the minimum threshold of €15,000:5.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German tax collector.
The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this tax period.
As part of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration asked for the examination of this supply of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech taxman said he had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that he had not registered the purchase of the goods in question.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of receipts - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech financial officer did not receive any documentation for the subsequent taxation of the acquired goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax fix was in place.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax collector explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1, it was shown that the answers of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. In its audit, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech financial administration had sent a request for information on the value of shipments to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person worth €86,307, but the Czech taxable person only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.
In response to the request for information, which was sent to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period set out in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German financial administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial officer asked for a review of a third and fourth quarter 2004 delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxman worth €1,265,554, using an SCAC form, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ noted that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request to the local financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxman had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new vehicles to this German taxable person, worth CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech financial officer corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax officer issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German Clo did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out by the German buyer in Germany, which found that the purchase of all the vehicles in question had been correctly taxed, and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, in the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech taxman purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German taxman.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In a request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not issued a VAT return since August 2004.
Even after being asked to do so by the financial officer, the Czech taxman did not issue any tax returns, and as a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT debt at zero for the period October to December 2004.
On 2 June 2005, the Clo issued an order to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German taxpayer.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the financial officer, he made a request for information on the above delivery to Germany.
As the answer to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the NKÚ audit how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the requirements of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because at the time of the NKÚ and BRH audit, the relevant FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxman worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, using an SCAC form, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his response to the request for information, the German finance official said that he had only received invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 double in its sales tax filings for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech finance official asked for a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxman worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, using an SCAC form, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German financial administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits with the Czech tax authority in order to verify the deduction of above-average taxes.
However, an unauthorised claim has not been established.
The BRH found that for the period in question, the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114, and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the receiver's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic inconsistencies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German taxable person, but the Czech taxable person did not declare this acquisition.
As the Czech taxman did not cooperate with the financial officer and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of how the German taxman had communicated with the Czech authorities as part of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed carrier.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer a false confirmation of payment of €155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax collector, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the financial administration subsequently taxed the turnover of goods from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a consignment of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €7,916.
In accordance with the German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the withdrawal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the rescission.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration asked for a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCACPressure.
According to the request for information, in the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxable goods with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit with the Czech tax authority to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax collector had supplied and assembled a production plant for the German company.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax collector did not take down the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German company the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the refunds, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
Through a request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices in the Czech taxable person's books had been properly recorded.
The sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, in response to the response of the Czech financial administration, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a single (goods) delivery of the Czech tax payer to the German taxpayer, including the assembly.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German service recipient of the factory delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German sales tax law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
As the turnover tax liability of the German taxable person remained unchanged, the German FA did not correct the VAT return.
13. According to the MIAS data, in February 2005 the Czech taxman A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from the German taxman C.
The Czech finance official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax lifter C delivered this machine to the Czech tax lifter B in 2004, but returned it to the German tax lifter C in October 2004.
According to information from the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax authority C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it was also revealed that in February 2005, the German taxman C delivered the machine to the Czech taxman A.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxman's office in the Czech Republic.
As this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
In a request to the local financial officer responsible for the taxable person B, the NKÚ found that, according to the MIAS data, the German taxable person C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
The taxman B said he did not receive the goods, so the local Czech financial officer sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations into the taxable person B, the financial officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been registered with the taxable person B and that it could be the same type of machine that the branch of the German taxable person C had delivered to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the Czech financial officer in charge of Tax Officer A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The financial officer had the invoice from the German tax authority C dated February 7, 2005, in which the taxable person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech finance official noted that the taxable person A had not recorded this bill.
Taxable A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxable person A.
The BRH found that the German taxable C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxable D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-exempt delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German financial officer did not recognise the claim of the German tax-exempt C for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German controller D delivered the machine to the Czech controller B.
Under German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005, the German tax authority C had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax authority A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005, the Czech financial administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German financial officer asked for the review of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German finance official said there was a suspicion that this was a ﬁktive intra-Community supply of goods.
The German taxpayer has not been active in business since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax authority.
The head of the Czech company said that this was probably a claim made by the German tax-payer to the German financial administration, which the Czech tax-payer had made to the German FA as a shareholder in the German company.
According to the information given to the NKÚ, the Czech finance official has so far no information that the German financial administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax payer.
From the information available, it is clear that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax collector.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to specify the intra-Community acquisition in the receivers' tax returns (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax collector supplied Czech taxable goods with a total value of €33,205.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech financial officer asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its response to this request for information, the German side said that the German taxman had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxman, and that he had personally picked up the other goods.
In a request to the local Czech Fi- nanzbeamer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxman had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the value of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech financial officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech tax collector.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German tax collector delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax collector.
For the same period, a Czech tax collector declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the interstate exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax authorities and the MIAS data.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax collector and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk to the company owner about issuing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no additional sales tax return has been issued.
The Czech finance official told the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactive VAT fixing for the tax period in question would be met.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German taxpayer.
As part of the interstate exchange of information, the German finance official asked for a review of whether the Czech tax authorities mentioned actually existed, as the alleged capital owner of the German tax collector had set up a number of bogus companies in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxman confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authority, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer provided evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxable person was not registered as a taxable person in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech finance official provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German financial administration.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax collector had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German tax collector and at the same time asserted the right of deduction for the acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary sales tax return issued after the external audit, the Czech financial officer fixed the VAT debt unchanged.
According to Czech law, in this case, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
As a result, the Czech financial officer came to the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax officer corrected the tax return and demanded the payment of VAT worth €1,600.
In addition, the relevant FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, operators declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German financial administration on whether the Czech taxman had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German taxman in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied as an attachment by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.
A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was also attached to the facility.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not brought a vehicle into the Czech Republic and indicated that he had no contact with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech finance official answered the request for information and said at the same time that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer is not based at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the company's managing director is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period in February 2005, the Czech financial officer fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxman at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial officer had rejected the German tax payer's claim to exempt this delivery from VAT due to the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech tax collector was supposed to have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax collector.
As the acquisition declared by the German tax-payer was not in line with the MIAS data, the German financial officer asked for the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the interstate exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official said that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax collector issued a VAT return and a ZM, which was signed by an unauthorised person, namely the company's shareholder, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech taxman told the financial officer that the owner of the capital had deposited the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the financial officer had recognised the Czech taxable person's claim for VAT exemption for goods deliveries to other Member States, worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German financial officer did not correct the German acquirer's sales tax return, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there is no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT debt.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax collector purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in his 2004 VAT return or in his 2005 tax return.
In addition, he did not declare any value-related outputs.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods totalling CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax authorities had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration said that the German request could not be met because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representatives).
The documents provided to the NKÚ by the relevant financial officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax authority, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the commencement of the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the financial officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the only managing director expired on 16 May 2005, without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech taxpayer has not issued any sales tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the two countries.
The two auditors exchanged information on the cases under review through the Clo of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do tax-exempt business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and for their delivery to Austria on behalf of, at the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity of its own, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax authority (UDE) based in Germany.
The following illustration shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out on his own behalf, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the receiver is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is a different country from the seat state of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its sales tax returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) delivered intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria as well as intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM issued to the German Clo.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences between the data in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation of 2004.
The audited cases also show that it takes some time for the tax-payers and the tax payers to apply the new legal requirements:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax collector reported shipments of goods totalling CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax collector.
In the same period, another Czech tax collector reported intra-Community deliveries in his ZM to another German tax collector with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it was electricity supplies.
Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further review of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004, different legal requirements were in place for the supply and acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
While in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the supplies of electrical energy to be intra-Community supplies of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004, which were in force in 2004, according to German legislation, it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable sales in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. In the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax collector declared intra-Community deliveries to a German tax collector for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 totalling CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax collector in his ZM for the same period intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector worth CZK 263,470,776.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it was a supply of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law 235 / 2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the acquirer has his legal headquarters, his registered office or his place of business for which this delivery is made.
For this reason, the Czech tax authorities should not have specified the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both controllers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-community supplies led to a difference of 503,881,939 CZK in MIAS.
Closing remarks
The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing the VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
Some of them are worth watching.
On the basis of the audit results, both auditors drew up recommendations on the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.
