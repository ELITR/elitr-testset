Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the accounting offices are empowered to audit all public finances.
The statement requires that the accounting firms have the power to consider the tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of European Top Accounting Authorities (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be a significant part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI. EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, formed the audit of public revenue by the accounting offices.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is especially true of taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly linked and dependent on each other, there may be a situation where national accounting firms can carry out their audit activities only in cooperation with other states' accounting offices.
As an example, testing of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many states.
Cooperation between authorities is needed in the fight against such offences.
Accounting firms that examine this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea of an audit of the sales tax as well as the MIAS system is with the VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn was created. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating accounting offices first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Due to the evaluation of the available information, we selected the test items for the test planning.
Achieving sound and effective management of sales tax is a long-standing problem and individual States (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, to simplify the collection of turnover tax and to create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only help improve the work of financial management, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the turnover tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
File numbers: CZ) 06/27 (EN) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Exam object:
(CZ) Management of sales tax after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
The Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the examination in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures used by the financial administration in the field of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as "EC") with free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption.
(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on official assistance in the field of turnover tax, in accordance with the above Regulations.
As a result of the test, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made on how to remedy them.
Value Added Information Exchange System The audits were carried out due to an on 8 July. Agreement concluded on 1 June 2006 by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Bundesrech-nungshof ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the recovery of information obtained through international assistance between financial administrations and the comparison of turnover tax management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was drawn up within the meaning of European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The period under review covered the period 1. May 2004 until 31. December 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two accounting offices.
In addition to the focus on exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation 1925/2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, including: For example, registration of tax securities, tax returns and summary messages.
In addition, the test also extended to the legal situation in cross-border passenger transport by bus and to the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of sales tax administrations in the two States, differences were noted in the following areas:
1) Registration for sales tax purposes.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is to exceed the turnover threshold laid down in the Sales Tax Act.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable persons only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax payer receives a tax number only applicable to domestic transactions for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German tax payer wishes to carry out significant intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called USt-IDNo., to be issued.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules within the EC should be harmonised (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus is duty-free, but there is a right to deduct the advance tax.
In Germany, the transport power, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to sales tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level, the situation referred to in Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28. To unify with the Common System of Turnover Tax (see 4.2) on 1 November 2006.
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic the tax-payer tax returns must only be made for under-year tax periods (month or quarter), tax-payer in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Advance sales tax declarations and a annual revenue tax return after the end of the calendar year.
Unlike the Czech Republic, tax-payer companies in Germany must submit pre-tax statements by electronic means.
The introduction of the PTO in the Czech Republic would improve the incidence of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While tax agents in the Czech Republic are required to submit their summary notifications to the Financial Offices (CMO), German tax agents are required to submit summary notifications to CLO2.
Accordingly, in the Czech Republic, the information from the Summary Notifications is available to the Federal Republic immediately after they have been submitted.
The information from the Summary Reports is only available after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat turnover tax fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of Summary Messages would shorten the period between the time of sales and the updating of MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the buyer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of turnover tax.
In the event of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO shall monitor compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German Financial Administration has made a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the specified time limit.
Because of these problems, the BRH recommended that the German CLO be constantly monitored (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each Member State shall develop its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
As part of the cooperation, the two accounting offices examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions realized between Czech and German tax objects.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed by taking advantage of CLO's legal possibilities, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of turnover tax fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the CMO used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In these cases, the taxable persons had either unlawfully used the VAT exemption or failed to identify the purchase of goods in their sales tax return.
In some cases, the CMO could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because they were incomplete or incomplete.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused the requested information.
A number of cases were uncovered where taxable persons in their summary reported transactions incorrectly.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were accordingly faulty, so that in these cases the employees (the CMO) had to determine (see 6).
Examination procedures
Verification procedure in the CR
The check became in the period from June, 2006 to March, 2007 from the department II – „a state budgetary income“ and the territorial exam departments central Bohemians, northwest Bohemians, south Bohemians, Südmähren, Zentralmähren and Nordmähren carried out.
Checked posts were: The Ministry of Finance and 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kada ň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NKÚ approved the audit findings on 23 July. April 2007.
Inspection procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the Department of Transport Taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the 4th. Quarter 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the test in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in BMF and CLO, the test was conducted in the following Länder:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following CMO have been included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, joy town, Karlsruhe town, mountain Leon, Mühlacker, singing, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich bodies, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large-scale enterprise, the Hannover north, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn city centre, Cologne middle, Köln-Porz, the Cologne south, Saint Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, the Chemnitz south, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, discussions were held with the German Federal Ministry of Applied Sciences in Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, the German State of Applied Sciences and the Federal State of Upper Austria.
The audit results were communicated to BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two accounting offices
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held by representatives of both accounting offices.
Participants in these meetings became familiar with the organization of financial management, sales tax legislation, and the system of sales tax management in each other's country.
The subject matter of the test phase was agreed at the May 2006 meeting.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following review topics were determined for the parallel tests: 1.
Registration of control agents.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus - Legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the conduct of financial officials in the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problems identified in the requests for information, as well as practical information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on supplies and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the sales tax area.
At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides became familiar with the audit procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and questioned the results of the parallel tests already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1.000.000 shall be paid on the first day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Law No 235/2004 Coll., concerning turnover tax; Hereinafter referred to as "Law No 235/2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he or she exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer if the latter has exceeded the application period for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, place of business or an establishment in the Czech Republic who provides benefits subject to VAT or benefits exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must be registered for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million but meets other conditions specified in Law No 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the conditions laid down in the law may voluntarily apply for registration for sales tax.
The registration procedure in accordance with Law No 337/1992 shall commence with the receipt of the registration application with the local financial officer.
Those who wish to be voluntarily registered for sales tax must indicate in their application the deadline from which they apply for registration as a sales tax payer.
The financial officer shall examine the information provided by the contractor, i.e. the completed application for registration with all installations.
If he has doubts about the information given therein, he shall require the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
Where, by verification, the financial officer has determined that the trader meets the conditions for registration, he shall give written notice of the registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the financial officer shall indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for turnover tax and the period for the acquisition of turnover tax.
The forecast period is the calendar quarter; Unless the operator's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached CZK 10.000.000 or more.
If this is the case, the estimate period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached CZK at least CZK 2.000.000 the previous calendar year shall be entitled to choose the calendar month as an estimate period and shall inform the financial officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration certificate always has a constitutional character.
The tax payer shall indicate the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the financial officer, and in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law No 235/2004, concerning the selection of tax documents) 3.
The control number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or any other general identification mark, in so far as a special law so provides. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No 337/1992).
If, despite the request of the financial officer, the contractor has not fulfilled his lease, the local financial officer shall register him on his own initiative.
This will also be notified to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, each undertaking authorised to engage in a business shall receive a tax number on its first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as sales tax users.
According to Law No 235/2004, which was 1. On January 1, 2005, the financial officer may, in the event of the non-performance of the right to register the turnover tax, require that the taxable person have up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable amount turnover which the person concerned has engaged in illegally without taxation, for the period from the date from which the trader would have been registered as a tax payer on the tax payer (until the date of 2004) to be registered as a tax payer (§ 98).
The payment of the amount thus determined is regarded as a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are in place, registration of a sales tax dividend may be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly because the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No 235/2004).
A tax payer may apply for the cancellation of his registration not later than one year after the date of entry into force referred to in the registration decision.
2) Cancellation of registration of its own motion (§ 106 (7) of Law No 235/2004) if: (A) the taxable person has not provided any benefit in the 12 consecutive months period and has not informed the financial officer of the reasons for this, (b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his payment adjustments under Law No 235/2004; (c) the previous taxable person no longer meets the conditions for the tax amount.
B) Taxable persons with no legal place of business, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic. A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State who has no legal place, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic or a non-taxable third party who provides benefits in the Czech Republic and who is not liable for tax purposes in accordance with Paragraph 108 of Law No 235/2004 '.
He must submit a request for registration with the FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.
It shall be leased, in this application, all UST No allocated to it in other Member States or third countries. to brag.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration later than on the day of the first taxable benefit scheme in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register it retroactively, as it became chargeable for sales tax pursuant to Law No 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable benefit scheme in the Czech Republic.
In the event of retroactive registration, the FA shall require Prague 1 from the operators concerned to provide proof (invoices or written explanations) of the performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic prior to the first performance of a benefit, the FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
31. 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1 on December 1, of which 124 were registered from Germany. 31. A total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered on December 1, 2005, of which 224 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No 235/2004, the financial officer shall be entitled to 31 the registration of a non-resident contractor. January this follow of the calendar year to extinguish if this does not accept the Verpﬂichtung to the delivery of tax registrations or explanations and to the tax payment.
When examining the NKÚ, it became apparent that in the event of a tax return being issued by mail with dispatch abroad on 25 July. January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for the submission of a tax return, this declaration until 31 January. January has not yet been received by the FA.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of registration, are addressed to the FA later than at the 31. It is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident contractor for sales tax in the Czech Republic in the calendar year concerned.
Registration of tax agents in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the Tax Code (§ § 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be notified to the municipality and/or to the competent Tax Office.
This notification shall be made no later than one month after the commencement of business activities.
The municipality shall forward the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business transaction has been commenced but has not been notified, it may also retroactively register the tax payer on its own initiative.
In Germany, taxable persons, whether resident or non-resident, are leased for registration for Zwekke of sales tax if they meet the conditions laid down in Section 2 of the German Sales Tax Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of sales generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special SMEs are responsible for entrepreneurs established abroad.
For example, B. for those enterprisers who have her seat in Czech Republic, the FA the Chemnitz south responsibly.
This was 30. April 2004 - registered with 295 Czech entrepreneurs; 1. 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there on March 1, 2006.
According to the BRH, these NGOs, with special responsibilities, chiefly refused to register so-called headlamps residing in the new medium-sized companies. Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since, after the accession of these ten States, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These self-employed persons do not comply with the conditions laid down in Section 2 of the UStG for recognition as an entrepreneur, since they are usually absent from a single contracting entity which determines their working time and the type of execution of the work.
In order to be registered, the trader must complete a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the undertaking and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a form binding on all German Federal States.
It is handled either in special organizational units within the CMO or in the units of organisation generally responsible for tax suspension.
This form is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer before assigning a tax number.
The establishment of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, The following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, The following five (or four) digits are the identification characteristic for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, in order to be able to make intra-Community supplies free of tax, he needs a VAT ID No.
This is assigned by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The USt ID No. Is automatically allocated by the CLO when the taxable person declares intra-Community supplies in his or her pre-tax statements or annual sales tax returns.
The USt ID No. Is composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. when he ceases to operate), but only after all tax transactions have been completed (incurring all financial years) or 2. If the financial management finds that he no longer operates a business.
Typically, the validity of the USt ID No depends. From the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the CMO must inform the CLO of the cancellation of the VAT number so that the UST ID No. Can be terminated at that time.
According to the Sales Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax agents do not have to pay sales tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the turnover tax resulting therefrom has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2nd is unlikely to exceed €50,000 the following year.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge sales tax to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are saddled to sign up to the tax office and make an annual sales tax return.
A small business operator may declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration shall be binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the sales tax and deduct the advance tax.
Non-resident tax agents can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The condition is that they only engage in tax-free transactions and waive the deduction of VAT.
The fiscal representative complies with the tax priorities of the foreign contractor so that it does not have to be registered for the purposes of sales tax.
The invoices shall indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states varies.
While entrepreneurs are registered in Germany regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the excess of the threshold amount referred to in the Sales Tax Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he or she may voluntarily register.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the various federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax payer will receive a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the event of its registration for sales tax, this tax number shall also apply to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who can register for sales tax purposes will receive a tax number exclusively for domestic German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wishes to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically assign a VAT ID No. apply.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-stage registration system in other Member States such as the Czech Republic, which awards a single identification number for both national registration for sales tax and intra-Community transactions, could lead to significant misconceptions.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not declare his business to the municipality or to the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows for a sufficient estimate of the VAT on turnover for previous periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the tax liability.
Since the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be harmonised.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be assigned by the Federal Central Office for Taxes to each natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
Where a natural person enters into business, the competent FA shall apply for a commercial tax identification number as UST ID No. serves.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of the USt ID No. give.
Work to implement an IT process for managing the numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus
Legal provisions in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of section 70 of Law No 235/2004, since 1. May, 2004 the transportation from passengers between the single member states as well as between the member states and third countries in Czech Republic of the sales tax releases and there is claim to pretax deduction.
The exemption from turnover tax shall also apply where the transport of persons registered as persons liable for tax in Member States other than Member States is carried out by foreigners who are liable for tax.
The return journey is considered a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than cross-border passenger transport by bus, they shall not be allowed to register in the Czech Republic as having effect on turnover tax.
Cross-border passenger transport was exempted from the VAT weight in the Czech Republic under the Law of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The referring body is worded as follows:
'For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border carriage of persons, either until the condition laid down in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or for as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the present Member States'.
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28. November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b (1) of the UStG, a transport performance is carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic portion of the transport power is taxable in Germany.
Nor does German taxation distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident person carries tax persons through Germany, the part of the transport in Germany shall be regarded as a taxable person.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident contractor must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
The latter shall register it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and shall issue a special certificate for each motor bus mentioned in the declaration of the taxable person.
The entrepreneur must state his tax-bearing transport services in a German sales tax return.
1. March 2006, there were 741 Czech bus contractors registered with the FA both in Germany and in the South of Germany.
If the transport performance is provided to a domestic resident, the non-resident tax payer does not have to pay the sales tax himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic buyer of the services must pay the turnover tax to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident tax payer. This operation is referred to as the 'relocation of the tax liability partnership' and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to being notified by a non-resident tax payer and his income tax return, the German Financial Administration has several means of examining the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable persons' promotions:
Mobile control groups of the customs check the certificates of motor buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each test, the mobile control groups shall send an inspection report to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay the sales tax before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax payer may deduct the turnover tax thus paid from the tax liability indicated in his sales tax return.
If the FA has doubts about the correctness of a sales tax return, it may order an audit which has taken place in the FA, or may use the means of assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the lawfully fixed sales tax, the FA may request assistance under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to be too expensive for a non-resident bus operator to verify the VAT return or compliance with the tax weight of a non-resident bus operator in relation to the low level of revenue tax on tax-related passenger transport.
In particular, checking the books of a non-resident taxpayer causes disproportionately high costs to the taxpayer himself and to the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, for which it is necessary not only to know the foreign language but also the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit is expected to have a higher amount of time than that of a resident tax payer, although the test is limited to passenger transport in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must not only exercise the audit rights of his national financial management, but also those of the other Member States, in so far as he carries out the promotion of persons there.
In addition, for each Member State where only one person is carried out, the taxable person must comply with all existing tax obligations in the different languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services will result in a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation varies in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, promotion of persons between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from turnover tax under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport performance is subject to sales tax in accordance with the German national transport route.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport performance for the first time, he must notify the competent FA thereof in advance.
This records the tax payer who must declare the tax-bearing share of the transport performance in a tax return in Germany.
The law enforcement in Germany is very time consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax agents registered with the FA in the West of Germany have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The amount of tax in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which 46 the turnover tax referred to in Article 28 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC. 7 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax volume.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of the VAT incentive, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax liability in one Member State.
This could be the state where the promotion begins or where the service provider is based.
Such a type of taxation would amend Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28. On November 2006.
Sales tax explanations
Filing and processing of sales tax returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise provided by the Law, the trader shall be entitled to pay a sales tax return on the form laid down by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period, even if no tax liability has been incurred.
The tax liability shall be incurred at the end of the period for the submission of the sales tax return. In accordance with Law No 235/2004, the VAT on imports of goods is excluded from this scheme. Here, the maturity of the tax is determined in accordance with the customs rules.
Where above-average deductible advance taxes result in a refund claim, that amount shall be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the date of the fixing of that deduction without the need to draw up an application for this purpose.
The period shall not be applied in cases where the financial officer initiates a tax procedure relating to the taxable person's tax liability.
According to Paragraph 73 (11) of Law No 235/2004, the right to deduct VAT may be invoked at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year during which the right to deduct was established.
After the expiry of this period, the deduction may be relied upon within three years of the end of the tax period during which the application would have been possible for the first time.
This requires, however, the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
One on 1 July. January 2005, novella of Law No 235/2004, which entered into force, allows the lodging of a supplementary sales tax return only for the period during which the right to deduction could have been invoked for the first time.
A tax payer must make a supplementary sales tax return if: (A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, (b) he makes corrections which do not alter the last known tax liability but only change previous information, (c) he makes adjustments to the turnover tax rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of Law No 235/2004.
A tax payer may make a supplementary sales tax return if the sum of corrections reduces the tax debt.
The taxable person must make the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
The return of sales can be made electronically either via the Internet or by means of media.
The delivery via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to disk.
The form for the sales tax return contains separate lines for specifying the value of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.
The value of related services must be given in separate lines of the sales tax return.
Some rubrics are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered as registered for tax purposes shall be compared with the data provided by Czech tax agents in their summary reports.
The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States from persons registered as registered for tax purposes shall be compared with the information contained in the Summary Declarations of taxable persons from other EC Member States.
Under the ATIS system, a credibility assessment of sales tax returns is carried out at the FA.
This is done automatically because the sales tax return cannot be processed without the previous audit.
The credibility assessment involves calculating the standards for credibility and assessing the risks of sales tax returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million against persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under that or special tax law or a decision under that law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech financial offices to provide technical assistance to the tax collection.
In its examination, the NKÚ found that, in the absence of a declaration of turnover tax, the CMO rarely took advantage of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person concerned.
Filing and processing of sales tax returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly sales tax advances and the annual sales tax return.
Those taxable persons who are leased to submit VAT advance declarations must nevertheless make an annual sales tax return.
Even small business owners who are not leased to pay the sales tax must make an annual sales tax return.
The taxable persons are in principle saddled, up to 10. Day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the turnover tax arises, submit a sales tax advance (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the turnover tax debt was more than €6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the contractor shall be required to submit monthly sales tax advance declarations at the latest by 10. The day following the end of the month concerned shall be leased.
The taxable person may also choose to file monthly sales tax advances if he has received an amount of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual sales tax is not more than €512, neither sales tax advance nor sales tax returns shall be made.
A resulting turnover tax liability shall be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund may lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) Deadlines for processing sales tax returns and reimbursement of sales tax overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security may be offered for the refund amount.
In principle, sales tax returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German Sales Tax Act allows an extension of these (tax or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be applied for separately.
Where it is granted, the VAT advance declarations and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment shall be made for this purpose.
This payment shall be offset with the turnover tax liability established for the pre-notification period of December.
If an error is detected, the entrepreneur must make a corrected sales tax advance.
There is no "complementary" sales tax return.
Is that until 31. May of the following year's sales tax return once delivered to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect sales tax advance, but only the incorrect annual sales tax return.
Corrections to this sales tax return for the benefit or disadvantage of the taxable person shall be made within four years of the end of the year in which the first sales tax return was issued.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a sales tax return may normally be corrected only in cases of a light-finished tax cut or tax evasion.
The taxable persons must submit the VAT advance declarations by electronic means.
The CMO may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unseemly hardening.
The annual sales tax return may be made in paper form or by Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the tax payer must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no sales tax advance declarations are made, the Financial Administration shall be entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person 6.
In case of late charge, the taxable person may be subject to a delay surcharge (up to 10% of the tax debt or up to €25,000).
In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FRY often did not charge this delay surcharge.
In cases where the CMO charged the delay surcharges, the amount was determined uneven and arbitrary.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average default, particularly when issuing the annual sales tax return.
The form of the sales tax return contains separate lines for values relating to intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the supply of services.
Non-taxable transactions shall be indicated in a separate line of the sales tax return.
The sales tax returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to which all data are recorded electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a false selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The sales tax declarations so selected must be checked by the competent person in charge on the basis of the automatically produced audit instructions (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only needs to make a rough estimate of the turnover tax debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, the taxable persons shall submit their sales tax returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, depending on the amount of their tax liability of the previous year, the taxable persons must submit their advances at the latest 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The Annual Statement of Turnover Tax shall be made no later than 31. May of the following year.
The balance to issue an annual sales tax return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxable person may correct the errors in the monthly advance declarations by submitting a single sales tax return;
- If the taxable person corrects its information on intra-Community transactions, the correction may not be allocated to a specific notification period of the ZM;
- The classification of the same MIAS data on intra-Community acquisition of German tax payer only after the annual sales tax declarations have been normally processed.
In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs are required to make a sales tax return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This tax ceiling enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business operators.
In addition, the competent FA may balance the annual statement of turnover tax with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration may review the amount of turnover only on the basis of the income tax return paid.
Unlike the rules in force in the Czech Republic, German taxable persons are leased for the electronic submission of the VAT advance declaration.
The introduction of the postal weight for the electronic filing of the tax return in the Czech Republic would increase the incidence of the Czech financial administration.
Summary messages
Submission and processing of summary messages in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No 235/2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State shall submit such summary messages (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the goods delivered shall always be expressed in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down by UST-IdNr7, the individual taxable persons under which they are registered in the other Member State.
The ZM does not provide information on services.
The taxable persons with calendar monthly or fourth annual taxation period shall have the ZM no later than 25. Issue to the local competent FA day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data shall be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the detection of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM are always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, the tax agents can also hand over the ZM electronically.
If a tax payer does not surrender a ZM or correction ZM, even though it is leased under Law No 235/2004, the financial officer shall request it to surrender the ZM in question, reallocating it to the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-performance of non-monetary guidelines, the financial officer shall be empowered to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No 337/1992.
In its examination, the NKÚ found that the CMO mostly did not use its power to impose fines on its secluded taxable persons.
In particular, in the case of the ZM, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to comply with their lease weights, since the omission of a ZM does not give rise to the level of their turnover tax liability.
In accordance with Section 102 (5) of Law No 235/2004, the financial officer is required to check the information contained in the ZM or Corrigendum, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of non-compliance
8 of the data in the ZM with those The taxable person corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting an amending ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The financial officer shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- The tax-payer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction-ZM) and therefore corrects it by issuing a correction-ZM,
- The financial officer has demonstrated the incorrect nature of the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM or Correction ZM.
Financial statements entered by the financial officer, without a correction ZM being issued by the taxable person, do not replace the balance of the taxable person to issue a correction ZM, but only result in the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that these are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM shall be transmitted to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority referred to for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive such data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department for International Assistance in the Field of Turnover Tax in the Ministry of Finance). The message "O _ MCTL" automatically receives the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt ID number specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
Becomes the incorrect USt ID No. Used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of incorrect UST IDNr.
The list contains a "Message about doubts regarding USt-IdNr.."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
In the case of the acquisition of goods from another Member State, the taxable person shall state this in his sales tax return and enter the value of the acquisition in the rows of the sales tax return intended for that purpose.
The CLO shall forward to the competent FA selected cases of differences between the values of the acquired person declared by the Czech tax payer in his sales tax return and the values for the supply of goods specified by the supplier from the other Member State in its ZM.
The technical officers there must examine the deviations.
Three different situations can then occur:
(A) The value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of its sales tax return is lower than the value of the supplies indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer shall verify the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation may arise either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the sales tax return (the Czech tax payer, meanwhile, makes a supplementary sales tax return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to nevertheless verify the accuracy of the information in the sales tax return.
C) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States indicated by the Czech tax payer in his sales tax return is higher than that reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and explaining the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer enters the results of its review in ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of operations sent for review by the CLO is set out in Graph 1 for each quarter of 2005 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO has decreased for each quarter of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number in the 4th century. Quarter 2005 is based, inter alia, on the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a wrong selection, taking into account the minimum level for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information contained in the sales tax declarations and EC data do not always have to be based on an error made by the domestic buyer.
There may also be an error of the taxpayer in another Member State, or an error caused by different types of supplies in the ZM in each EC Member State.
The most significant reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited CMO are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of Summary Reports in Germany
Operators who make intra-Community deliveries to other EC Member States from Germany or participate in triangular transactions must issue a quarterly ZM listing intra-Community deliveries by acquirer (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be carried out no later than 10. The date of the month following the calendar quarter concerned.
Where a permanent extension is granted for the submission of the VAT advance declarations, that extension shall also apply to the ZM.
The ZM must be delivered to the CLO.
Since 1. On January 1, 2007, the electronic charge is temporary.
The competent FA may permit exemptions for individual tax breaks in order to avoid undue hardening.
If the taxpayer determines that the ZM was defective, the tax payer shall be leased within one month for the purpose of issuing a correction ZM.
If the ZM is not surrendered, the CLO initiates a enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - First memory - second memory, coupled with the threat that a penalty payment will be fixed and - the penalty payment set.
Although the German Tax Code allows the fixing of a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO establishes in three stages penalty payments of €125, 250 and €500.
In addition, Section 26a (1) No 5 of the UStG states that the taxable person acts in an illegal manner if he does not properly, completely or in due time or if he does not correct a ZM or does not rectify it in good time.
This infringement can be fined up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the NGOs because only the CLO is responsible for processing the ZM.
The data of the ZM is stored only with the CLO.
Only after the CLO has been processed, the information from the Summary Messages is available to the CMO.
The time limits for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In case of incorrect USt ID No. In the ZM of German tax agents, the German CLO receives a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
As a result, the CLO applies to the entrepreneur and requests the correct data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the respective competent FA.
It is then up to him to request the correct information.
As part of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs were USt-IdNr. Adjusted at the request of the CLO.
However, the memory, as well as the threat and fixing of up to three consecutive forced funds, takes too much time if a tax payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were ultimately reported to the competent CMO, were usually completed within one to two Mona-ten.
The respective competent FA refused to grant the tax exemption for the intra-Community deliveries notified in the 73 % of this forfeit9.
Set the right USt ID No. , The FA requested him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO because the CMO cannot correct the MIAS data itself.
The FRY found that neither the CMO nor the CLO controlled the levy of the corrected ZM.
That is why the tax-payer often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data contained in the sales tax returns, no comparison shall be made between the information on deliveries of goods and the corresponding data in the ZM and the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the CMO. This is usually done when preparing a sales tax special audit.
Data collected from other Member States shall be processed at the CLO.
Incorrect USt ID No. Are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data are used for the control of labour tax in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Once they are available in the system, they match the CLO with the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be drawn up and sent to the competent CMO.
This is done continuously, whereas an outpouring of the labour force data of all sales tax assets is later drawn up and forwarded to the German Federal Republic.
The risk management system (RMS) for the estimation procedure then compares these data to those relating to intra-Community purchases.
The system reviews fully (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the pre-tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community supplies to a person registered for turnover tax in another Member State must submit an ZM to the local competent FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FDI process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community supplies reported by the taxable persons in the ZM shall be aligned with the values of intra-Community supplies indicated by the same taxable persons in their sales tax declarations.
The results of the adjustment shall be taken into account in the context of the tax determination.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are liable for payment of quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Since 1. On January 1, 2007, the control agents must submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available from the CLO after their processing.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the taxable persons in the ZM indicate only the supplies of goods.
The supply of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech Federal Republic, the German Federal Republic cannot itself correct incorrect data in individual lines of the given ZM.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect UST IDNr became. Even if the control pad weighs the correct USt ID No. To the FA.
The German Financial Administration does not compare the information relating to intra-Community supplies made by German tax agents in their pre-sales tax statements with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between pre-notification data and ZM are not regularly detected before the German CLO transfers MIAS data to other Member States.
On the basis of these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.
The data provided by other Member States on supplies of goods to Czech taxable persons shall be matched in the Czech Republic by the data relating to the purchases of goods entered in their sales tax returns by Czech taxable persons.
The Czech CLO shall make the comparison separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations will be forwarded to the German Civil Code for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control shall be carried out only in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German Tax Administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons only if the RMS has produced an audit notice or the taxable person has been selected for an audit anyway.
This procedure relieves the Federal Republic of Germany from clarifying the reasons for any differences.
On the other hand, the detection of sales tax fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as soon as possible.
The current system of ZM, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information which may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax-payer had to surrender monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only significantly increase the bureaucratic burden, since most of the taxable persons in the Czech Republic and Germany are already leased to submit monthly sales tax returns or advances and ZM does not require more information than for the sales tax declarations or advance declarations.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the levy of ZM could be linked to the submission of sales tax returns or advance declarations.
However, a per-month allocation of ZM would cause more periodic discrepancies between intra-Community supplies and intra-Community purchases and increase data flows between CLO.
In 2006, the federal government acquired the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the Federal States.
These feared that a monthly transmission of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
It is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level so that monthly updating of MIAS data is possible in order to enable the payment of ZM per month.
Statistical information on the supply of goods and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the main business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both accounting offices requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or USt ID No. In the O _ MCTL messages exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of these quarters.
This data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTLMeldung entered.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
International exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who have exported them.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of property tax, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as' Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 '), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: The exchange of information upon request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information shall be made upon request by means of a request for information (in particular: Request for information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
Financial officers in the Czech Republic shall send their RFI or replies to a RFI received by the Financial Directorate to the CLO. This concerns the translation of the information provided in the standardized SCAC form into the foreign language and the transmission to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the replies to requests sent. It worries about their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent CMO for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for processing it.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period considered were examined by the NKÚ.
From the total number of 94 of RFI received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; In a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no answer had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ 's examination. More detailed information on the deadlines for reply by the Czech Republic within the requests made by Germany is available in Graph 2.
From the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) made to Germany from the Czech Republic, in 136 cases (i.e. 40,6%), an answer was made within the three-month period; Another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases: For example, the NKÚ 's examination has not yet received a reply from Germany (in the remaining one case it was not possible to establish, on the basis of the stated information, when Germany replied to the request for information).
More detailed information on the time limits within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered is given in Graph 3.
The percentages of intra-Community transactions indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graph 4.
The graph above shows that the transactions examined in connection with requests for information mostly had values of over €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured, or in the form of courier information.
Financial officials of other Member States are often provided with information without prior request which is important for the determination of the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected from the CLO.
Exchanges of information between Member States shall be made electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular intervals, in advance, without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously established information to another Member State without prior request as soon as the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States in automatic exchange of information on supplies of new vehicles.
This information shall be obtained from the financial officer from the form of notification concerning the supply of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No 235/2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer shall enter the necessary data in the relevant document template and forward it directly to the competent staff of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, these data shall be transmitted to the other Member States within the prescribed period, not later than two months after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic shall also provide the other Member States with information on transactions in the mail order trade which are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions which appear inadmissible and on potential missing traders.
This information shall be transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in the spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information is carried out by the local competent FA.
The Federal Republic of Applied Sciences will send the completed form SCAC 2004 directly to the German CLO, which will forward the SCACVordrucke to the foreign CLO.
The Federal States of Applied Sciences are instructed to complete their requests for information or courier information only in German, even the SCACVordruck used is one-off.
Half of the German requests for information examined by BRH were submitted in order to ensure the taxation of labour in the other Member State or to demonstrate the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall verify that the value of the supplies referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount of 15,000 €.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding an turnover below the minimum amount limit.
Furthermore, the German CLO worries the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or English.
In order to reply to the request for information, the CLO shall direct it to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines are set at the various levels of German financial management.
While the German CLO has the technical means of monitoring the conservation of fresh materials, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the Federal Republic of the answer to the undrafted requests for information.
The Federal Republic of Applied Sciences shall receive the necessary information by writing the taxpayer or by carrying out an out-of-check.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of testing: The Special Assessment of Turnover Tax, which covers all transactions that are subject to tax within a period of several months, or the so-called Sales Tax Review, which may refer only to a recent transaction.
This short and irreversible form of examination does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and it has proved itself in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany shall provide the other Member State with the following information: - On UST No. allocated to undertakings established in other EC Member States - on the refund of the advance tax to operators established in other EC Member States.
Furthermore, Germany has failed to provide the other Member States of the European Union with the following information in the context of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. Delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to sales tax in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a taxpayer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. Intra-Community supplies of goods which were improperly subject to taxation by the taxpayer in Germany, e. Potential missing traders that have made intra-Community transactions, whether their UStIdNr. Is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as F. taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential Missing Trader or to customers who have a USt ID No. Used abusive.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or courier information is carried out in the Czech Republic as well as in Germany on the initiative of the local Federal Republic of Germany, which send the relevant SCACV prints to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACVordrucke (Czech-English) and translates provided information into the English and German languages respectively, the German Federal States follow the instructions to submit requests for information or courier information on a one-language form only in German.
The German CLO does not make translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period 1. May 2004 to 31. On 1 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech Financial Administration handled 74.5% of the requests received within the three-month period, while the requests for information submitted to Germany were made by the German Financial Administration only in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO points out the German Civil Code to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of late answered requests for information.
Therefore, the BRH recommended a continuous remembrance procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has changed by now.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the financial offices of answering the pending requests for information.
Sales tax-risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial management are concerned with risk management in the field of sales tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organizational units are responsible for risk management and combating turnover tax fraud:
The Department for Methodology and Economic Management of Turnover Tax or its Risk Management Unit is concerned with identifying potential risk fields for tax volume and evaluating trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the criteria for "credibility of sales tax returns" and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion within the framework of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it shall evaluate products that are at risk, prepare for risk management in the field of turnover tax and cooperate in this field with the competent EC bodies and the other Member States.
The Department for International Assistance in the Field of Turnover Tax shall ensure, inter alia, the exchange of information, shall contribute to the creation and transfer of a relevant information database, evaluate the data available in the MIAS system of other Member States, provide public relations and shall be responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The Tax Audit and Tax Enforcement Methodology Department shall carry out, inter alia, risk analyses in the context of methodical control of tax audits, set priorities for the work planning of financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases under consideration, draw up risk analyses to combat tax evasion and collect information from financial management as well as other sources and make proposals for measures to combat tax evasion in this context.
Tax clearance agencies exist with the financial directorates. Their tasks include searching for tax agents and industries that are at risk in terms of the chivalry of tax evasion (e.g., Internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searching for unregistered tax agents (e.g. in the sectors of Internet services, labour transfer, electronic and print media, etc.), investigating local chain information and communication authorities.
Special testing units have been set up in 12 selected NGOs.
These have regional jurisdiction and, on the basis of appropriate authority, also carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the German Civil Code.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in established new and "improved" forms of tax evasion particularly related to chain shops.
These specific units shall check in accordance with the requirements of the tax agencies or shall focus on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and tax persons with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks of turnover tax have been integrated into the ATIS system: - The task of 'the credibility of sales tax returns' to assess the risk of deduced tax returns, - the task of 'selecting the taxable persons to be audited', with the selection of the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria, the task of 'MIAS', which allows financial officers to access the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task allows, among other things: - Verification of the validity of the USt ID No. Of taxable persons from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable persons concerned from other Member States, - Preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not supplied ZM - Formal control of the data supplied in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable persons in the other Member States which have failed to supply VAT in their Member States, prior to the non-dumping list, before the non-dumping of which Czech States have failed to the non-dumped VAT data are transferred to the non-dumping data in the Czech.
As part of their perception of duties to combat tax evasion, financial officers have access to the data from state authorities such as trade registers, Land Registry, Motor Vehicle Records, Rifle Register, etc.
More detailed information is provided in section 4.4.1 of the Summary Reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal construction in the Federal Republic of Germany, both the Federal Insurance Authorities (particularly the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 Federal States are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.
While there are common working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the Federal States fully have a single data base.
At CLO level, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as' CUSS '- Coordination Body for Turnover Tax Special Audits and Tax Enforcement Measures) collects audit findings on fraud cases in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was established at the KUSS. There, financial offices can enter and also query the names of discovered missing traders or revenue tax agents.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of sales tax fraud at national level and cases of cross-border sales tax fraud.
The experience of the KUSS will be introduced into the development of the RMS through its cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and BMF are also involved.
Formal verification of the composition of UStIdNr. Other Member States appearing in the ZM of German tax payer shall be carried out by the CLO.
This formal review is carried out before the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (see 4.4.2).
Verification of validity in the ZM named USt ID No. Is based on the O _ MCTL identifiers submitted by the other Member States (for the purpose of correcting invalid UST No., see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of communications for the discovery of suspected missing traders. As indications, certain features are used, usually occurring in carousel stores.
The Federal Police of the Federal States are dependent on the processing of these communications and have the result of their investigation in certain cases to be forwarded to the CLO.
The BRH's audit has confirmed that all available features need to be included to close with sufficient likelihood of a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH recommended the BMF to work with combinations of different signs in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as: For example, the payment behaviour of the taxable person, the industry or the interests of the company.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the Federal States and focuses on the processing of turnover tax advances and annual declarations.
For example, to create the system For example, a list of those taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their sales tax advance or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO in order to monitor the complete delivery of ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisition stated by the tax payer in his annual sales tax return is compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the Federal States avoid comparing quarterly data as these would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; z. B.:
- Suppliers and acquirers shall assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community turnover;
- Different accounting records and tax declarations of skonti and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the sales tax declarations with the MIAS data, many municipalities have certain risk management mechanisms based on information contained in the sales tax returns and certain other indications (e.g. company terms, age of holders/shareholders, number of employees and method of payment of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a fixed-rules risk management system that allows a team of anti-tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to programme their own rules in such a way as to eliminate suspected tax agents.
This system is used in the processing of the VAT declarations by the German Federal Police Office.
As a result, the competent FA receives the information provided by the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not learner, risk managers must adapt the rules according to feedback from the CMO.
Mecklenburg-Western Germany has developed an adaptive neuronal network based on the data of uncovered lagging cases.
Because of this data, the RMS is capable of learning the characteristics for tax evasion.
The system creates a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent CMO shall decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, tax auditors must report their results, allowing the RMS to learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neuronal network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on many data from edited sales tax returns and some other evidence, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called datamining system) calculates how likely a tax payer is to be engulfed in tax fraud.
After that, it creates a monthly list of alleged tax agents.
On the basis of this list, the CMO shall select the taxable persons concerned for verification and report the audit results to the data center concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be targeted.
Whether the expected effects will be adjusted during actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although the present report does not allow the specific criteria of the RMS to be addressed in Czech and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German Länder mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border sales tax fraud.
Sales tax fraud - particularly carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national but a European problem.
The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this is not done, fraudsters seek out the Member State with the weakest RMS for their offences.
The tax breaks caused by pan-European fraud in sales taxes do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the company is established.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
This is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the verification of individual transactions In the context of the parallel audits, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and recoverability of information on selected deliveries and/or
Buyers who have been the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two offices jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, the implementation of which had doubts, or which the tax agents of both States explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax agents.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax agents had indicated in their tax returns and ZM, due to communications from the BRH.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax agents.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different procedures of registration in the EC Member States lead to the problems referred to in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €60,500 from a German tax payer.
When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech Financial Administration made a request for information to Germany in order to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax payer concerned had addressed its Czech counterparty in the 2nd century. Quarter 2004 goods worth €27,381, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
Further, it emerged from the response that the USt-IdNr.. Of the German tax liability is only valid from 28 January. Was valid on September 1, 2004. However, the German CLO had granted another request by the German tax payer and the validity of the USt-IdNr. Retroactive to 1. May 2004.
The German tax payer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech tax payer.
By asking the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech tax payer had made supplementary sales tax returns for each (under-year) taxable period during which he declared a higher value of the acquisition from other Member States while also seeking the deduction of input tax from the purchases from the other Member States.
The competent officer of the Czech Financial Office could not clearly determine, on the basis of these additional sales tax returns, whether in the declared buyers the value of the supplies of the following: German suppliers included.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as having effect on sales tax in September 2003.
However, when registering, he had not requested the allocation of a VAT ID No., but only of a tax number applicable to Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to retroactively apply a USt ID No to a taxpayer. In 2006, the competent managing officer of the German Financial Administration responded retroactively to 1. May 2004.
The German CLO shares a USt IdNr. Retroactive if the deut entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; z. For example, if the CLO applies for a UST ID No to the delay upon request by the tax payer. caused.
In this case, the CLO grants the USt ID No. Retroactive because the entrepreneur does not have a valid UST ID No for intra-Community delivery in accordance with Section 6 of the UStG. needs.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) USt ID No. Its supplier to declare intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these differences in procedure between Member States, the German CLO granted UST No. In this particular case retroactive.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial officer requested a review of the German entrepreneur's turnover tax registration.
The MIAS data results from the date of registration of the 5. In a registration certificate issued by the local competent German FA of 1 March 2005. October 2004.
The German authorities stated in their reply that the German tax dividend was effective on 1 July. It was registered on 16 October 2004, but had not been registered until 16 July 2004 for organisational reasons. February 2005 in Germany a USt-IdNr.. To be assigned.
By request from the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ learned that the financial officer had carried out a turnover tax review for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005 at the Czech tax payer.
In this audit, the Finanzamt found that in its sales tax return, the Czech tax payer had declared services worth CZK 9.897, which he had made to the German tax payer prior to its turnover tax registration (i.e. before the 1. October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office established a tax liability of CZK 1,880 to the Czech tax payer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German tax payer weighed the USt ID No. It was not until he was assigned on 16 July. Its company registered with the FA in 2004 on 1 February 2005.
In addition, the FA retroactively registered him from 1. October 200415 for sales tax purposes in order to be able to monitor the submission of the sales tax return for 2004.
In this sales tax return, the tax payer stated significant intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In its revenue tax return for September 2004 as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported goods supplies worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax payer.
When verifying the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS system, the Czech financial officer found that this registration did not take place until the 11. November 2004 and thus valid after deliveries of goods to Germany.
The Czech tax payer issued a supplementary sales tax return declaring sales from domestic supplies worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax amounting to CZK 21,777, which he paid.
By asking the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer subsequently submitted a request to resume the taxation procedure in relation to the supplementary sales tax return. As evidence, he filed a confirmation from the German financial administration that the German tax dividend had been significant since 1. Was registered on January 1, 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech financial officer reviewed the validity of the registration of the German tax payer as part of the international exchange of information.
The German information showed that the German tax liability was only 11. November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of goods, a USt ID No. Had been assigned.
As a result, the Czech financial officer dismissed the request to resume the taxation procedure.
The BRH found that no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place in this case because the German tax payer was only on 11. November 2004 a USt ID No. Had received.
However, the German recipient explained both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the turnover tax on this and also called for the refund of advances of the same amount.
Because this did not result in a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German tax payer, the German financial officer did not correct the data in the sales tax return.
The BRH also found that the German tax payer's company, referred to in the request for information, was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, leading to confusion between two German tax agents.
This change in name at the German tax payer also confused the Czech financial officials.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial officer reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax payer from a German tax payer worth €22,686.
By asking the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had examined, as part of an expiry review with the Czech tax payer, whether the delivery had actually been made and whether the Czech tax agent had recorded and paid the invoice for the supply of the goods.
The Czech tax payer did not declare the subsequent acquisition in his sales tax return because the German supplier did not have its USt-IDNr in the invoice. But only his tax number intended for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax payer is only effective from 21 January. April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech payer, registered for turnover tax related to intra-Community turnover.
The Czech Financial Officer also requested that the German Financial Administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax payer so that it could, if necessary, initiate a corresponding taxation procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the acquisition of goods from a non-corporate (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose a sales tax on the acquisition of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, under German law, a tax payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have a VAT ID No. Have to have intra-Community supplies in order to be able to use the VAT exemption for such a supply.
The supplier only has to use the UStIdNr. Have the purchaser in the other Member State and have been able to prove the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.
In this case, turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply which should be subject to labour tax in the Czech Republic.
In any event, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident because the supply of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount of €15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech tax payer acquired from a German tax payer goods worth €12,561.
The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this tax period.
Within the framework of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech Financial Administration requested an examination of the supply of goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he had not received the goods, that he had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German Financial Administration rejected the request for the transmission of supporting documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech financial officer did not receive any documentation for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit remained without result, and the original tax imposition had stock.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as "Fiskalvertreter17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax payer explained these deliveries in his sales tax return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognized.
On the basis of the communication from the BRH, the German FA will send the documents necessary for the subsequent taxation of the goods purchased to the Czech Republic.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the German Financial Administration's responses to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more chiefly than the Czech Financial Administration's replies:
6. In its audit, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration was operating on 5 July. A request for information on the value of in 4 October 2005. In the quarter of 2004, Wa was delivered to Germany.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax payer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €86,307; However, the Czech tax payer declared only the acquisition of goods worth €35,314 for the same period in his sales tax return.
In response to the request for information made by the Czech Republic on 9 July. May 2006, after the expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed since the German company was dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German Financial Administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech Tax Administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial officer requested, by means of a SCAC form, the verification of the delivery of motor vehicles in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to a German tax agent worth €1.265.554, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ found that a German response to the request for information had not yet been received at the time of its examination.
By asking the local financial officer, the NKÚ found that in its sales tax return, the Czech tax payer had not declared the supply of new motor vehicles to that German tax payer worth 11.816.103 CZK.
The Czech financial officer corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax payer issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local competent FA for examination.
Following notification by the BRH, a special sales tax review was carried out with the German acquirer in Germany. It was found that the acquisition of all the cars concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were further sold to other tax persons in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax stockholder acquired in the 4th century. Quarter 2004 of a German tax payer weighs a car worth €48,500.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare a intra-Community acquisition.
By request from the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had not made a sales tax return since August 2004.
The Czech tax payer made no tax returns even after request by the finance officer. As a result, the FA continued on 23 July. May 2005, the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 is zero.
On 2. On June 1, 2005, the CLO produced an instruction to check the abovementioned delivery from the German tax payer.
Since the Czech tax payer did not cooperate with the financial officer, he made a request for information on the abovementioned supply to Germany.
Since the answer to the request for information was not received until 7 July. February 2007, until the completion of the examination of the NKÚ, it was not known how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to the failure to comply with the guidelines under the Czech Sales Tax Act, the sales tax registration of the Czech tax payer became effective from the 23. August 2005 deleted.
In some cases, only one partial response was sent because, at the time of examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial officer requested, by means of a SCAC form, the verification of a third quarter 2004 delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €16,991, showing signs of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German financial officer stated that only the invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities concerning supplies worth €16,335 were available to him.
On the basis of the request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the external examination carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed with the acquirer in Germany.
The German acquirer explained the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in his sales tax advances for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech financial officer requested, by means of a SCAC form, a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles made in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005 to a German taxpayer, worth €198,167, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German Financial Administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic confirming that the German taxpayer had acquired several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local competent FA had carried out several external checks at the Czech tax payer in order to verify the deduction of above-average pre-tax duties.
However, an unauthorised claim was not established.
The BRH found that for the period in question, the German tax payer had declared in his sales tax returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States totalling €579,114 and that the German FA's audit with the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's revenue tax return and the information contained in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistency 18 or the incorrect declaration of turnover as intra-Community supply of goods were not the main reasons for the differences:
11.
According to the data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005 the Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth €35,716 from the German taxpayer; However, the Czech tax payer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the financial officer and no business activity took place at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech financial officer requested, as part of the international exchange of information, to verify how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech company.
The German response to the request for information showed that according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech tax payer was unknown at the stated address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer supplied only goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax-payer sent the German tax-payer a false payment confirmation of the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax-payer.
After discovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech buyer, the German tax payer managed to recover the supplied material, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
By asking the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech tax payer, the financial administration subsequently carried out the turnover tax on supplies of goods from other Member States amounting to CZK 388,522.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had only reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €7,916 after corrections.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax-payer stated that the supply was withdrawn and that the tax base was reduced in the quarter of the initial statement.
Its ZM included the following information concerning the Czech taxable persons:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German Financial Administration requested, by means of a SCACVordruck, the verification of a supply of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax payer had supplied the German tax payer with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit at the Czech tax payer to investigate this supply.
In response to the request for information, the Czech Financial Administration informed the Czech tax stockholder that a production plant had been delivered and assembled to the German company.
The Czech taxpayer provided the individual parts of the production plant prior to the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was placed on the basis of the order after 1. May 2004 mounted.
The German tax stockholder did not decrease the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax dividend calculated the German production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax payer received the Rech-nungen, but did not recognize it and did not pay it either.
By request from the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices had been duly recorded in the books of the Czech taxpayer.
The sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax payer and related to invoices invoiced after the first May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech Financial Administration, the local competent FA concluded that these transactions were a uniform (goods) supply of the Czech taxable substance to the German, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is mounted.
The German supplier of the plant supply owes the sales tax in accordance with the German Sales Tax Act.
At the same time, the recipient may claim a deduction of VAT in the same amount.
As the German tax payer's tax margin remained unchanged, the German FA did not cause a correction to the sales tax return.
13. According to the MIAS data, Czech taxpayer A acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German taxpayer company C. in February 2005.
The Czech financial officer made a request for review of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side informed that the German tax-payer C delivered this machine to Czech tax-payer B in 2004, but that he returned it to German tax-payer C in October 2004.
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but instead to the establishment of the German tax company C in the Czech Republic.
It was further apparent from the reply to the request for information that the German tax-payer C had delivered the machine to Czech tax-payer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German tax company in the Czech Republic.
As this delivery (from C to A) occurred only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community supply of goods.
By request from the financial officer responsible for the tax-payer B, the NKÚ found that according to the MIAS data, the German tax-payer C had delivered in the third quarter of 2004 to the Czech tax-payer goods (another machine) worth €88,027.
The tax-payer B stated that he had not received this product, so the Czech financial officer in charge of the local authorities made a request for information to Germany.
The answer to this was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigation with the taxpayer B, the financial officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been booked with the tax-payer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the establishment of the German tax-payer C had delivered to the Czech tax-payer company A in February 2005.
The NKÚ continued to note that the Czech financial officer responsible for tax liability A had carried out an audit at the latter.
The financial officer had the invoice of the German tax-payer C of 7 July. February 2005, in which the control point A must be stated as the receiver of the machine.
The Czech finance official noted that the tax-payer A had not recorded this bill.
The tax-payer A had concluded a lease with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same kind.
The lease shop delivered the machine on 9 July. February 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information for the determination of the tax liability of the taxable person A.
The BRH found that the German tax-payer C delivered the machine worth €88,027 not to the Czech Republic but to another German tax-payer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German financial officer did not recognize the German tax-payer C's claim to turnover tax exemption and corrected the information in its tax return.
The German control buffer D supplied the machine to the Czech control point B.
Under German law, this supply was not taxable in Germany but was subject to sales tax in the Czech Republic.
The BRH continued to note that the German tax-payer C in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax-payer A.
This delivery was not verified during the tax review carried out by the German FA.
The figure below is the contractual relationship between the counterparties involved in the above operations.

When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that Czech financial management was on 4. October 2005 received a request for information from Germany in which a German financial officer received the verification of intra-Community supplies of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German financial officer stated that there was a suspicion that this was an intra-Community intra-Community supply of goods.
The German tax payer has not engaged in active business since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had carried out an off-check with the Czech tax payer.
The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim by the German tax-payer vis-à-vis the German financial administration, which the Czech tax-payer claimed to the German FA as a shareholder in the German company.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech financial officer has so far no information on the fact that the German financial administration is handling the case with respect to the Czech tax payer.
The information available shows that it was not a supply of goods; Nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as a intra-Community supply of goods from Germany to a Czech tax payer.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to state the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (s.a. section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax payer supplied a Czech value of €33,205.
However, the Czech tax payer did not declare intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech financial officer requested an examination of the supply of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech payer and that the other goods had been picked up personally.
By request from the local Czech FiR official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had issued a supplementary sales tax return for the period concerned before receiving a response to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisition could not be clarified, so the Czech financial officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech tax payer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer had delivered in the third quarter of 2004 to a Czech tax equivalent goods worth €46,854.
For the same period, a Czech tax payer declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for review of the actual value of the delivery.
The German reply to this question sent three invoices representing a total value of €31,999 of the delivered product, i.e. an amount equal to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech tax payer and the MIAS data.
By request from the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that, after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had reached out to the accountant of the Czech tax payer and had stayed with her in such a way that she wanted to discuss the submission of a supplementary sales tax return for the third quarter of 2004, after reviewing the invoices together with the company owner.
So far no supplementary sales tax return has been made.
The Czech Financial Officer informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way as to ensure that the time limits for retroactive tax fixing for the tax period concerned were maintained.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax payer delivered €11,600 worth of goods to the German tax payer.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial officer requested a review of whether the Czech tax payer actually existed, since the alleged investor of the German tax payer had established a number of headlong flows in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.
However, according to the Czech tax dividend, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax payer submitted supporting documents for the sale in January 2005.
The Czech payer was not registered in Germany as having effect on sales tax and had not taxed the sale of the product in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech financial officer provided this information in his reply to the request for information to the German financial administration.
By request from the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax payer had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax payer while claiming the right to deduct VAT from other Member States.
In his Czech sales tax statement, he did not apply for sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
Due to a supplementary sales tax return issued after the expiry audit, the Czech financial officer set the turnover tax liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, there was no acquisition of goods from other Member States in this case, since the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech financial officer reached a wrong conclusion in the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which indicated that the goods had not left Germany, the German financial officer corrected the German tax payer's tax return and called for the payment of sales tax worth €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notification to the FA responsible for the actual consignee of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community supplies that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech financial officer received a request for information from the German Financial Administration on whether the Czech tax payer acquired a car worth €47,400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied, as an annex, by a copy of the Czech tax payer's sales tax registration certificate.
As a further appendix, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech finance official found that the passport was stolen, that the person named therein had not introduced a vehicle to the Czech Republic and claimed it had no contacts with a German tax payer.
The sales tax registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech Financial Administration.
By providing such information, the Czech financial officer replied to the request for information while stating that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car.
By request from the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax agent is not based at the address indicated in the trade register and that the managing director of the company is unreachable.
Following a tax liability procedure for the tax period February 2005, the Czech financial officer set the Czech tax payer's tax liability at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it on the basis of an Internet ad.
The BRH found that the local German financial officer had rejected the German tax payer's claim to exemption from sales tax on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an expiry review, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the sales tax return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax payer should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not comply with the MIAS data, the German financial officer requested the verification of supplies and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its response to the request for information, the Czech financial officer stated that the Czech company's only managing director was on 8 July. July 2005 was deleted in the Commercial Register and a new Managing Director has not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the product was allegedly a relative of the Czech company's shareholder.
The Czech tax payer issued a sales tax return and a ZM signed by a person not authorised to do so, namely that shareholder of the company, after the appointment of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the financial officer that the investor had paid the payment received in euro for the goods charged into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By request from the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the financial officer had recognised the Czech tax payer's right to exemption from VAT on supplies of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1.326.307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1.416.180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German financial officer did not correct the German acquirer's sales tax return, since a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit did not show any signs of tax fraud, there is no prospect of actually charging a fixed turnover tax liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax payer acquired in 2005 goods from the Czech Republic worth €4.251,196, according to which he had acquired goods worth €43,274 the previous year.
The German tax payer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition either in its sales tax return in 2004 or in that for 2005.
He also did not declare any value-based starting sales.
Because of these inconsistencies, the German FA made a request for information concerning 4. Quarter 2005 and 1. Quarter 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods totalling CZK 167.246.083.
On 6 July. The request for information was received on 1 September 2006, in which the German side requested that it be examined whether the delivery notified by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech Financial Administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a Managing Director (or other legal representative).
It can be seen from the documents left to the NKÚ by the competent financial officer that, together with the Managing Director of the Czech Tax Office, on 30 July. A Protocol on the commencement of the VAT review for 4 March 2006. Quarter 2004 and the period January to December 2005.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the financial officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the Trade Register, the term of office of the sole executive was on 16 July. May 2005 expired without a new managing director being appointed.
The Czech tax payer has not made any sales tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel examination, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two accounting offices exchanged information about the cases under consideration through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not established in Germany, informed the competent FA of its intention to make taxable transactions in Germany.
Due to this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive German USt-IDNr.
The (UCR) accepted a contract from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and for their delivery to Austria on behalf, on the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company transferred part of the contract to a German tax payer (UDE) in Germany.
The following figure represents the contractual relations and transport route of wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own bill for assembly.
Due to the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the supply of wind turbines is taxable in Austria.
- Because the shipper was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out on its own behalf, at its own risk and on its own account, the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable persons in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German Sub-Contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the supply was intended is a different 19 than the State of residence of the Czech undertaking.
Accordingly, die- se delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its sales tax returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport began.
However, transport was carried out on some of the wind turbines from the Czech Republic and on others from Germany.
- The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The supply of the remaining wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community supplies in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although there is no evidence of tax fraud or evasion in this case.
In addition, the NKÚ and BRH examined case sizes to show the size of the differences between the data contained in the sales tax returns and MIAS data caused by the different 2004 legislation.
The cases under consideration also show that it takes some time for the tax authorities to apply the new legal provisions:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax payer reported a total value of CZK 792.977.452 to a German tax payer.
During the same period, another Czech tax payer reported intra-Community supplies in his ZM to another German tax payer in the total value of CZK 18.157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that these were electricity supplies in both cases.
Both Czech taxpayers took into account the abovementioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No 235/2004 in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 different statutory provisions on the supply or purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.
While in the Czech Republic, the tax credits weigh the supplies of electric energy in accordance with the voting of Law No. 235/2004 declared intra-Community deliveries of goods, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635/2004, which 1 effective as of. January 2005, some tax provisions amended.
23. When examining intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax payer in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 declared intra-Community supplies to a German tax payer in the total value of CZK 240.411,163 and another Czech tax payer in his ZM of 4,476 for the same period.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases these were supplies of electrical energy.
According to the text of the from 1. Law No 235/2004 in force on January 1, 2005, where electrical energy is supplied, the place of performance shall be the place where the acquirer has his legal place of business, place of business or place of business for which that supply is made.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both tax agents treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a fair difference of CZK 503.881.939 in MIAS.
Concluding remark
The cooperation achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both accounting offices gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal rules applicable to sales tax management.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
For some of these, another observation is worth watching.
On the basis of the audit results, both audit firms made recommendations for managing sales tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the further observation.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both accounting offices is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of turnover tax management.
