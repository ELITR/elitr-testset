Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of value added tax in the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration adopted in 1977 stresses that sais have the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that sais have the power to examine the tax collection as far as possible.
The Organisation of the European supreme audit institutions (EUROSAI) regards taxes as an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in 2005 in Bonn, formed the audit of public revenues by the SAIs.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for the audit of public revenues.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenues with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, a Situation may arise in which national sais can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the sais of other states.
For example, the examination of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is necessary in the fight against such offences.
Sais examining in this area must be prepared to work closely together.
The idea of an audit of VAT and system VIES originated at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of auditors.
In the course of thorough preparation, the sais involved first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the analysis of the available information, we made the selection of the subject matter for the examination planning.
Achieving efficient and effective management of turnover tax is a long-standing Problem and individual states (in particular the EC member states) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of turnover tax and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved System of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of value added tax in the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject matter of the audit:
(CZ) administration of Value Added Tax after Czech Republic's accession to the European Union
(En) examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
the commission's audit objective:
(CZ) the purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to investigate the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of turnover tax following the Integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as “the EC”) with free movement of goods and services and the use of the MIAS1, in particular
(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-community VAT control, focusing on mutual assistance in the field of turnover tax under the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
VAT information exchange system the checks were carried out on the basis of an information exchange system established on 8 January 1999. The agreement, concluded on 30 June 2006, was jointly implemented by the court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international mutual assistance between the tax authorities and the comparison of the VAT management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with the European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1. May 2004 to 31. December 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel examination of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the focus on 'exchange of information' under Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) no 1925/2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary declarations.
In addition, the examination also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of Value Added Tax Administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) registration for purposes of VAT.
While in Germany the entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among other things, the essential criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold specified in the value added tax act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number only applicable to domestic transactions for VAT purposes.
If the German taxable person wishes to carry out intra-community transactions, he must issue a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID no., request.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) cross-border passenger transport by coach and bus.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by coach and bus is exempt from VAT, but is entitled to deduction of input tax.
In Germany, the transport service, if the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to address the Situation as referred to in Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/ EC of 28 June 2006 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products. The commission has decided to standardise the system for the common turnover tax system (see 4.2) by 31 November 2006.
3) tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic, taxable VAT returns are only required for taxable periods during the year (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Before the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, Taxpayers in Germany have to submit VAT returns electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech Tax Administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary Reports.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax offices (FÄ), German taxpayers have to submit the summary reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary notifications in the Czech Republic is available to the FA immediately after their submission.
The information from the summary notifications is only available to German FÄ after the CLO has processed them.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-community transactions is needed as quickly as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of turnover and the updating of MIAS data.
This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's member state (see 4.4), but only if all EC member states introduce the same time limits.
5) international exchange of information in the field of Value Added Tax.
For incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, within the prescribed period, the German tax administration carried out a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended to the German CLO, a constant Monitoring of deadlines (see 4.6).
6) risk management.
Each of the two member states shall develop its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a member state alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC member states. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the member state with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two sais examined selected cases of intra-community transactions carried out between Czech and German taxpayers.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed by CLO using the legal options in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspicions of VAT fraud.
The courts of auditors noted the following :
In some cases, the FÄ took advantage of the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In these cases, taxable persons had either unlawfully benefited from the exemption from VAT or had not shown the acquisition of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained from the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two member states.
In some cases, the tax administration of another member state refused the requested information.
A number of cases have been identified in which taxable persons in their summary reports misrepresented transactions.
As a result, the data in the VIES system accordingly, so that the administrator (ABIL) had to determine in these cases (see 6).
Test procedure
Examination procedures in the CR

The results of the audit were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two SAIs
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both sais were held.
The participants of these meetings made themselves familiar with the organization of the tax administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in each other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint Meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable was drawn up for the further procedure and the following examination topics were identified for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of Taxpayers.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by coach and bus legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. 3. 4. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of financial officials in the processing of requests for information and the review of selected problems mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary Reports.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and Purchase between the Czech Republic and Germany.

An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds CZK 1,000,000 shall be liable for payment on the first day of the third month following the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (section 94 (1) of Act no 235/2004 Coll. VAT, hereinafter referred to as 'law no 235/2004').
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not permit the retroactive registration of a taxable person who has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, place of business or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, the turnover of taxable supplies or VAT-exempt services with the right to deduction for the sales tax even register when his turnover exceeds 1 Million CZK, he meets the other conditions referred to in act no 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements of the law, may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
The registration procedure according to law no 337/1992 begins with the receipt of the registration application by the local tax office.
If you wish to register voluntarily for VAT, you must indicate in your application the date on which you apply for registration as a taxable person.
The tax officer shall examine the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all annexes.
If he has doubts about the information contained therein, he shall ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information contained therein.
The tax administrator has determined by Inspection that the entrepreneur meets the conditions for registration, he will issue a written decision on the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the decision, the Tax Administrator shall specify the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the taxable period for VAT.
Assessment period is the calendar quarter; unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 shall be entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and shall inform the tax officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration certificate always has a constitutive character.
The Taxpayer must indicate the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the financial officers, also in the cases where a special law (e.g. act No. 235/2004, on the issuance of tax documents)3.
The tax code contains the code " CZ " and a basic component in the Form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, provided that a special law so determines. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (according to the provisions of § 33 (12) of Act no 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has failed to fulfil his obligation despite a corresponding request by the tax officer, the locally competent tax officer shall register him of his own motion.
This will also be notified to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to carry out a business activity receives a tax number for any tax type at the time of his first registration.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
According to law no 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2004. In the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register Value Added Tax, the tax administrator may require that the taxable person has received up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover which the person concerned has unlawfully effected without taxation for the period from the date on which the trader should have been registered as a taxable person until the date on which the registration was effected by order of the tax administrator (Article 98 (1) of law no 235/2004).
The payment of the amount so fixed shall be deemed to be a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of law no 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a taxable person can be deleted for two reasons:
One)
Cancellation of the registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of law no 235/2004).
A taxable person may request the cancellation of his or her registration no earlier than one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration decision.
2) deletion of the registration, ex officio (§ 106 (7) of the act no. 235/2004), if: a) the Taxable person in the period of 12 consecutive months of service provided and the financial officials about the reasons for this are informed, b) the Taxpayer has not met its obligations pursuant to act No. 235/2004, c) the Taxpayer meets the requirements for the tax liability.
B) Taxable persons without a legal seat, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic, A Person registered for tax purposes in another member state and in the Czech Republic, neither their legal seat, place of business a permanent establishment or a taxable foreigner who performs in the Czech Republic of services, and in accordance with section 108 of the act no. 235/2004 for these services and supplies, a tax Declaration and to pay taxes ("non-resident contractor"), with the provision of the service subject to tax.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
In this application, he is obliged to declare all VAT ID no. specify.
If a non-resident trader requests registration later than the date of the first taxable supply in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, since he became subject to VAT on the date of the first taxable supply in the Czech Republic in accordance with law no 235/2004.
In the event of a retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall request from the companies concerned a document (invoices or written explanations) for proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic prior to the first performance of a service, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the service-based contract documents.
31. December 2004-were registered 473-resident entrepreneur at the FA Prague 1, of which 124 are from Germany. 31. December 2005-were a total of 951-based entrepreneurs, 233 from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of law no 235/2004, the tax administrator is authorised to register a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 December 2004. In the event that the latter does not accept the obligation to submit tax returns or declarations and to pay the tax, it shall be deleted from the calendar year until 31 January of the following year.
In the examination of the NKÚ it was found that in the case of the filing of a tax return by Post with dispatch abroad on 25. In accordance with the mandatory deadline for the submission of a tax return, this declaration is valid until 31 January 2015. The FA has not yet entered into force on January 22.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, are not disclosed to the FA later than on 31 December 2012, the FA shall be entitled to cancel the registration. The cancellation of the registration of the non-resident trader for Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic is no longer possible in the calendar year in question.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
According to the provisions of the tax regulations (§§ 137, 138 AO), each business must be registered with the municipality and/ or the competent tax office.
This notification must be made no later than one month after the start of business.
The municipality shall forward the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has started but has not been notified, it may of its own motion also register the taxpayer retrospectively.
In Germany are Taxable, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, for registration for the Purposes of sales tax is obliged, when you meet the conditions in § 2 of the German VAT act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
For foreign-based entrepreneurs special cases are responsible.
For example, for those entrepreneurs who have their seat in the Czech Republic, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible.
If this were to 30. In April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneur registered; to the 1. March 2006 were registered 1.050 Czech businessmen there.
According to the BRH, these cases with special responsibilities frequently refused to register so-called false self-employed persons residing in the new mittelbzw. Eastern European member States of the EC.
Since, following the accession of these ten countries, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed persons tried to circumvent these restrictions by establishing their own business.
These self-employed persons (Schein)do not fulfil the conditions for recognition as an entrepreneur specified in § 2 UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single client, which determines their working time and the type of work performed.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business carried out.
The questionnaire is a form binding for all cases in Germany.
It is processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the organizational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
This form is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain specifications:
The first three digits of the identification number for the responsible FA, The following three (or four) digits are used to indicate which Department within the FA charge, The following five (or four) digits of the identification feature for the Taxpayer, the last digit is always a check digit.
If a trader wishes to participate in intra-community trade, in order to be able to make tax-free intra-community supplies, he needs a VAT number.
This is allocated by CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The USt-IdNr. is automatically allocated by the CLO when the taxable person declares intra-community supplies in his pre-VAT declarations or in his annual VAT declaration.
The USt-IdNr. composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he ceases business activities), but only after all tax transactions have been settled (assessment of all financial years) or 2. when the tax administration determines that it no longer does business.
In General, the validity of the VAT ID no. from the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO about the deletion of the VAT number in order to determine the validity of the VAT number. at this time can be terminated.
According to the German Value Added Tax Act (Umsatzsteuergesetz, § 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxable persons are not required to pay Value Added Tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the applicable Value Added Tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 € and 2. will not likely exceed the amount of 50,000 € in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct input tax.
Although you do not have to pay VAT, small businesses are required to register with the tax office and submit an annual VAT return.
A small business can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration shall be binding for the following five years.
He may then invoice the value added tax and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident Taxpayers to appoint a tax representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only carry out tax-free sales and waive the input tax deduction.
The tax representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign trader, so that it does not have to register for purposes of Value Added Tax.
In the accounts, indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The Situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first prerequisite for registration (among others) is the exceeding of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he may register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but due to different organizational structures in the individual Länder differences may occur.
In the Czech Republic, at the time of its first registration, the taxable person receives a tax number for any tax.
In the case of his registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who can be registered for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for domestic German sales.
If the German trader wishes to carry out intra-community transactions, he must specifically assign a VAT ID no. request.
Both of the NKÚ the BRH found that the German two-tier registration system may result in other member States such as the Czech Republic, which assigned a single identification number for both the national registration for VAT for intra-community transactions, significant misunderstanding.
On the other hand, the two-tier System allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows a correct assessment of Value Added Tax for previous assessment periods, in particular a precise estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be harmonised.
The German parliament has recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the federal Central Office for taxes to each natural Person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural Person starts a business, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number that is used as a VAT ID number. serve.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the National Registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT ID no. give.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by coach and bus
Legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Act no 235/2004, since 1 January 2004, the provisions of Section 70 of Act no 235/2004 have been applicable. In the Czech Republic, it is exempt from VAT on the carriage of passengers between member states and between member states and third countries and is entitled to deduction of input tax.
The exemption from turnover tax applies even if the movement of persons registered as taxable persons in other member states or of foreign nationals liable to tax is carried out.
The return journey is regarded as a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than cross-border passenger transport by bus, they are not obliged to register as taxable persons in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport was exempted from VAT under the act of accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The above body States in the text:
'For the purpose of applying Article 28(3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the directive, maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition laid down in Article 28(4) of the directive is fulfilled or until the same tax exemption is applied by any of the present member states.“
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with article 46 of Directive 2006/112/EC of 28. November 2006, how it has been implemented in Germany by section 3b (1) of the UStG, is running a transport service where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and international passenger transport.
Only the part of the transport service attributable to Germany is liable to tax in Germany.
German taxation does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (Bus)entrepreneurs.
If a taxable person who is not established moves through Germany, the part of the movement attributable to Germany shall be deemed to be a taxable movement.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
It shall register it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and shall issue a specific certificate for each bus named in the Taxable Person's declaration.
The trader must declare his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
To the first. As of March 31, 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided to a trader established in Germany, the non-resident taxable person does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic consumers of services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident Taxpayer. This process is referred to as 'tax liability transfer' and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the declaration by a non-resident taxable person and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger movements:
Customs Mobile control groups shall check the certificates of motor coaches approved abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups shall submit an inspection report to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxable person may deduct the value added tax paid in this way from the tax liability specified in his VAT return.
Where the FA has doubts as to the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the FA or may use the administrative assistance appropriations referred to in Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 (see no 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the value added tax, the FA may request assistance in accordance with council directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too expensive in relation to the small amount from the VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the accounts of a non-resident taxpayer entails disproportionate costs for the taxpayer himself and for the tax administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, for which it is necessary not only to know the foreign language but also the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit is likely to take more time than a resident taxpayer, although the audit is limited to passenger transport operations in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxable person must not only accept the audit rights of his national tax administration, but also those of the other member states in so far as he carries out passenger transport there.
Furthermore, for each member state in which only one passenger transport is carried out, the Taxable Person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the different languages and on the basis of the forms issued by the tax authorities of the EC member states concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC member states and between member states and third countries is exempt from VAT under the act of accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the German national transport route.
Where a non-established Taxable Person provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA in advance.
This register the taxable person, who must declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is relatively low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member states – which have applied VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 June 2006 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes-are exempt from VAT. The common system of Value Added Tax, have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenues.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high cost of VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should be taxable only in one member state.
This could be the state in which the carriage starts or the provider is established.
Such type of taxation, an Amendment to Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 would. November 2006 request.
VAT returns
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise provided by the law, the entrepreneur is obliged, even if no tax liability has arisen, to submit a VAT return on the form specified by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the end of the period for lodging the VAT return. In accordance with law no 235/2004, VAT on imports of goods is excluded from this scheme. In this case, the due date of the tax is determined by the customs regulations.
If, as a result of above-average deductible input tax, a claim for reimbursement arises, this amount shall be refunded to the Taxable Person within 30 days of the fixing of the input tax deduction, without the need for an application to be made.
The period shall not be applied in cases where the tax administrator initiates a tax procedure with regard to the taxpayer's tax liability.
According to Section 73 (11) of law no 235/2004, the right to deduct input tax may be exercised at the latest with the regular tax return for the last taxable period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax has arisen.
After the expiry of this period, the deduction of the input tax may still be claimed within three years of the end of the taxable period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
One on 1. The amendment of law no 235/2004, which entered into force on 18 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been claimed for the first time.
A taxable person must submit a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax liability, but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections of the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of law no 235/2004.
A taxpayer may submit a supplementary VAT return, if the sum of the allowances reduces the tax liability.
The Taxable Person must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
The VAT return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carriers.
The submission via the Internet can be done with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carrier.
The VAT return form contains separate lines for the value of intra-community supplies and purchases.
The value of purchased services must be indicated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls within the Atis system.
The value of goods delivered to persons registered as taxable persons in other EC member states is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary reports.
The value of the purchases of goods from other member states from persons registered as taxable persons shall be compared by means of the MIA with the information contained in the summary reports of taxable persons from other EC member states.
Within the framework of the Atis system, the FA verifies the validity of VAT returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility of audit involves a calculation of the standards for credibility, and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
According to the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Act no 337/1992, the FA May repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not fulfil their non-monetary obligations under this act or a special Tax Act or a decision under this act.
Automated tax information system-automated tax information system used by the Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.
The NKÚ found in its examination that the FÄ rarely used the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxpayer in the event of non-submission of the VAT return.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly advance VAT returns and the annual VAT return.
Those taxable persons who are obliged to submit advance VAT returns must nevertheless submit an annual VAT return.
Even small traders who are not required to pay VAT must submit an annual VAT return.
In principle, taxpayers are obliged to pay up to 10% of their taxable income. 18 (2) VAT Act).
However, if the VAT liability in the previous year was more than 6,136 € or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is entitled to submit monthly VAT advance notifications no later than 10 April 2014. Of the month in question.
The taxable person may also opt for the submission of monthly VAT returns if he has received a refund of € 6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) VAT Act).
If the annual value added tax does not exceed € 512, no advance sales tax declarations or declarations of Value Added Tax have to be submitted.
A resulting VAT liability is payable 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund may result in a more thorough audit by the tax administration.
(Legal) there are no time limits for processing VAT returns and for reimbursement of excess VAT payments.
In order to receive a timely refund can be offered a security for the refund amount.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement claims, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT act allows for an extension of this (delivery or payment)periods (§ 18 (6) of the UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the advance VAT returns and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment shall be offset against the value added tax liability established for the December pre-reporting period.
If an error is detected, the trader must submit a corrected VAT advance notice.
There is no" supplementary " VAT return.
Is The until 31. Once the VAT return to be submitted to the tax office on May 15 of the following year, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance notification, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to these tax Declaration to the advantage or disadvantage of the Taxpayer within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT Declaration is possible.
At the end of this four-year period, a VAT return can generally only be corrected in cases of a slight reduction in tax or tax evasion.
Taxable persons must submit the VAT returns electronically.
The end user can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the declaration is submitted without certification, the taxpayer must also submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no advance VAT declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover generated by the taxable Person6.
In the event of a late payment, the taxpayer may be charged a late payment (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often did not charge this late surcharge.
In the cases in which the late payments were made, the amount was fixed in a mixed and arbitrary manner.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose to reduce the average delay, in particular when submitting the annual VAT return.
The VAT return form contains separate rows for the value of intra-community supplies or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable transactions shall be indicated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or recorded electronically by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are directly available to the tax administration.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
According to which all data are collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management process and a case selection is made on the basis of certain benchmarks.
The turnover tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible administrator on the basis of the automatically created test notes (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the taxable period.
Depending on the Taxable Person's turnover, the taxable period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxable persons must submit their advance declarations at the latest 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be submitted by 31 December 2014 at the latest. The following year.
The requirement to submit an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the Taxpayer may correct the errors in the monthly progress reports by submitting a single VAT return ;
- Where the Taxable Person corrects his information on intra-community transactions, the adjustment cannot be allocated to a specific reporting period of the CTM;
– The Länder do not match MIAS data on intra-community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual VAT returns have been normally processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German traders must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This obligation enables the German tax administration to verify compliance with the turnover threshold for small businesses.
In addition, the responsible FA may reconcile the annual VAT return with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can check the amount of turnover only on the basis of the Income Tax Return issued.
In contrast to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are required to submit the VAT advance notification electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit the tax return electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary Reports
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of law no 235/2004, a trader supplying goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another member state shall submit such summary reports (hereinafter referred to as “CTM”).
The value of the goods delivered shall always be expressed in Czech currency in the DM, broken down by the VAT IdNr7, of the individual taxable persons under which they are registered in the other member state.
Information on services is not provided in the CTM.
The Taxable Persons with a calendar month or quarterly taxable period shall not be entitled to deduct the taxable amount from the taxable amount by 25 February 2015 at the latest. On the day following the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data are corrected in a correction, ZM, within 15 days after discovery of the defect.
Incorrect data in the ZM are always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similarly to the tax returns, taxpayers can also submit the ZM electronically.
If a taxable person does not submit a CTM or a correction CTM, although he is obliged to do so by law no 235/2004, the tax officer shall invite him to submit the CTM in question, bearing in mind the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax official shall be entitled to repeatedly impose fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of law no 337/1992.
The NKÚ found in its audit that the SKILLS used their power to impose fines against your defaulting Taxpayer.
In particular, in the case of the withholding tax, taxpayers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the omission of a withholding tax does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
According to § 102 (5) of law no 235/2004, the tax official is obliged to review the information in the CTM or amending CTM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In The Event Of Non-Conformity
8 of the information in the CTM by which the taxpayer corrects incorrect information in the CTM by submitting a rectifying CTM either on its own Initiative or upon request.
The tax official shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other member states in the ATIS System if: :
- the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the CTM (or correction CTM) and therefore corrects it by giving a correction CTM,
– the tax official has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the CTM or correction CTM.
From financial officers entered Be - correctly, without a supplementary ZM by the Taxpayer was delivered, not replace, the obligation of the Taxpayer to submit a BerichtigungsZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in VIES, so that they are current, complete and accurate.
The data from the CTM shall be transmitted to the member states concerned.
Only the National Tax Authority referred to for cooperation with the other member states in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive such data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is carried out by the Department of international mutual assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The message" O_MCTL " is automatically sent to the CLO from the other member states.
It contains all the incorrect VAT ID no. which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
The incorrect VAT ID no. in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the revised ZM used, an entry in the list of false USt-IdNr.
The list contains a "message of doubt concerning USt-IdNr.".
The tax officer checks the data and enters the result of the verification into the System.
In the case of the acquisition of goods from another member state, the Taxable Person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the acquisition in the relevant rows of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisitions made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods specified by the supplier from the other member state in its customs code shall be forwarded by CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The persons in charge there must examine the deviations.
Three different situations can occur:
(a) the value of the supplies declared by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of its VAT return is lower than the value of the supplies declared by suppliers from other EC member states.
In this case, the tax officer checks the accuracy of the information.
(b) the difference is zero.
This Situation can arise either through a Change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier, ZM) are corrected or by a Change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech Taxable person shall submit, in the meantime, on its own Initiative to a supplementary VAT Declaration).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
(c) the value of the goods purchased from other member states as indicated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return is higher than the value of their supplies declared by the suppliers of the other EC member states.
In this case, it is the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax officer enters the results of his review in ATIS.
These results are sent to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination is shown for each quarter of 2005 in Graph 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by CLO den FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in 4. In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech CLO raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for a request for information to the other EC member states.
Deviations between the figures in the VAT returns and the EC data do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error of the taxpayer in another member state or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies are specified differently in the CTM in each EC member state.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited cases are shown in Table 1.
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany
Traders who make intra-community deliveries from Germany to other EC member states or participate in triangular transactions must make quarterly ZM, in which the intra-community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be notified no later than 10 April 2014. Of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a term extension is granted for the submission of advance VAT returns, this shall also apply to the ZM.
The ZM shall be submitted to the CLO.
Since 1. The electronic levy is mandatory from 1 January 2007.
The competent FA may allow exemptions for individual taxable persons in order to avoid unreasonable hardships.
If the taxpayer finds that the CTM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a correction CTM within one month.
In the event of non-delivery of the CTM, the CLO shall initiate a enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: – first reminder – second reminder, along with the threat of a periodic penalty payment and the fixing of the Penalty.
Although the German tax code allows for the imposition of a periodic penalty payment of up to € 25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO in three levels of penalties in the amount of 125, 250 and 500€.
In addition, Section 26a (1) No. 5 of the VAT Act provides that the taxable person acts in an improper manner, if he deliberately or recklessly fails to deliver a CTM correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he fails to rectify a CTM or not in time.
This violation can be punished with a fine of up to € 5,000.
Data on intra-community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ in the MIAS because the CLO is the exclusive responsibility for the processing of the CTM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary notifications is only available to the FA after the CLO has processed them.
The deadlines for processing CTM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.
The data of the CTM must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter (in MIAS) in question.
In the case of incorrect VAT ID no. in the ZM German Taxpayer, the German CLO receives a message "O_MCTL" of the other member state.
The CLO then applies to the entrepreneur and requests the correct data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the respective responsible FA.
It is then its task to request the correct information.
In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most traders had to pay the VAT ID no. at CLO's request.
However, the remembrance, threat and fixing of up to three consecutive periodic penalty payments requires too much time when a taxpayer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases were ultimately reported to the appropriate SKILLS, were usually completed within one to two months.
The FA, which is competent in each case, refused the tax exemption for intra-community deliveries declared in 73% of these Cases9.
The taxpayer submitted the correct VAT ID no. the FA asked him to submit a revised CTM to the CLO because the FA cannot correct the MIAS data itself.
The BRH found that neither the SKILLS nor the CLO-controlled delivery of the revised ZM.
Therefore, taxpayers often failed to comply with the request. Since the CLO has no access to the data of VAT declarations, there is no adjustment in the VAT returns and the VAT return information on delivery of goods with the corresponding information in the ZM before these data are sent to the CLOS of the other member States.
This adjustment can only be carried out by the FÄ. This is usually done when preparing a special VAT check.
Data received from other member states are processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID No. are detected and notified to the member states concerned.
The data is used to control the tax on acquisitions in the FA.
As soon as they are available in the System, the CLO matches the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications are issued and sent to the competent FEC.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a list of the acquisition data of All Taxable Persons is subsequently drawn up and forwarded to the FA.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares these data with those intra-community acquisitions.
The System checks in full (Only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-community supplies to a person registered for VAT in another member state must submit a CTM to the locally competent FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The NEED to edit the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-community supplies declared by taxable persons in the CTM shall be compared with the values of intra-community supplies declared by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the adjustment shall be taken into account in the context of the tax determination.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries are required to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar Quarter10.
Since 1. From January 1, 2007, taxpayers must submit the CTM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the CA are only available to the CA after its processing at the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and in Germany, the Taxable person in the ZM only deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech SKILLS, German SKILLS are not able to correct erroneous information in individual rows of the given ZM.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data incorrect VAT ID no. even if the taxpayer does not correct the correct VAT ID no. the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-community deliveries that German taxpayers provide in their VAT advance declarations with the information of the corresponding ZM.
Differences between pre-notification and CTM data are not regularly detected before the German CLO sends the MIAS data to other member states.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
The data on deliveries of goods to Czech taxpayers transmitted by other member states are compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchases of goods indicated by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO carries out the adjustment for each calendar quarter, separately.
The most serious cases of deviations shall be forwarded to the FAI for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-community acquisitions.
Such general control shall only be carried out by taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-community acquisitions of other taxable persons only if the RMS creates an audit notice or the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.
This method relieves the NEED of clarifying the reasons for any differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current ZM System, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that may be six months old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers would have to pay monthly DM.
The monthly levy would increase the bureaucratic burden not only irrelevant, as most Taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany anyway to submit monthly VAT declarations and are obliged to messages and the ZM is not more information is required than for the value added tax declarations and advance returns.
In order to avoid red tape, the submission of the CTM could be combined with the submission of VAT returns or pre –declarations.
However, an obligation to submit CTM monthly would cause more periodic discrepancies between the data on intra-community deliveries and those on intra-community purchases and increase the data flows between the CLO.
In 2006, the Federal government considered the General introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the länder.
They feared that a monthly transmission of MIAS data to the Clos of other member states could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order to ensure that the obligation to levy CTM monthly has an effect, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level so that MIAs data can be updated on a monthly basis.
Statistical information on goods and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both SAIs have requested data on the number of incorrect tax identification number or VAT-ID-no. in the O_MCTL messages, which were exchanged for the individual background of the quarters between the Czech Republic and Germany.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different basis for calculating the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers to the Numbers on the calendar quarter for which the ZM was made, the German CLO his Numbers on the calendar quarter in which O_MCTLMeldung received.
International exchange of information at Level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information makes it possible for financial officials to obtain from other member states information on intra-community transactions and on taxpayers who have exported them.
The regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 of the Council was repealed on mutual administrative assistance in the field of VAT Directive (EEC) no 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as “regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 of the Council”), distinguishes between two basic types of information exchange: The exchange of Information on Request and the spontaneous exchange of Information (without prior Request).
The international exchange of Information on Request is made through a request for information (engl. request for information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic shall send their RFIs or their replies to a received RFI to the CLO by the Finance Directorate. It shall ensure that the information provided in the standardised SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and forwarded to the other member states.
CLO also receives requests for information (RFIs) from other member states and replies to requests sent. It shall arrange for their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the competent FA for processing.
Art. 8 of regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from the receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period under review were examined by the NKÚ.
From the total of 94 of the RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%), this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no response was sent to Germany until the examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to the requests made by Germany can be found in graph 2.
The total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a response within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases no response was received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NKÚ (the remaining one could not be determined on the basis of the information declared when Germany responded to the request).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic have been answered from Germany can be found in graph 3.
The percentages of intra-community transactions shown in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graph 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information were mostly worth over € 60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials of other member states are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for the determination of the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, All information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between member states is carried out electronically.
“Automatic exchange”, in accordance with regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 of the Council, means the systematic communication of predefined information to other member States, at regular, predetermined intervals, without prior Request.
'Structured automatic exchange' means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to another member state without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic shall inform the other member States automatic exchange of Information about deliveries of new vehicles.
This Information is obtained by the tax official from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to § 19 of law no 235/2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the tax officer enters the required data in the corresponding document template and passes it directly to the responsible employee of the Tax Directorate, where these data are collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, these data shall be transmitted to the other member states within the specified time limit, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic shall also provide the other member states with information on mail order transactions exempt from tax in the country of origin, on intra - community transactions which appear inadmissible and on potential 'Missing Traders'.
This information shall be communicated to the other member States by means of a SCAC-form, in the spontaneous exchange of Information.
International exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the Initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information is based on the local FA.
The NEED to send the completed form to SCAC 2004 by E-Mail directly to the German CLO, which directs the SCACVordrucke to the foreign CLO.
The cases are instructed to only write their requests for information or spontaneous information in German, even the Scacvardruck used is unique.
Half of the BRH audited the German request for information was forwarded to the acquisition to ensure taxation in the other member state or to the tax exemption of intra-community supplies from Germany to the other member state to demonstrate.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another member state, it shall examine whether the value of the supplies referred to in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of € 15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover that is below the minimum amount.
In addition, the German CLO concerned the Translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC-form [(B1-17), or (E)], if they are written neither in German nor in English.
In order to respond to the request for information, the CLO forwards the request to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines are laid down at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor the maintenance of the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FA of the response to the requests for information which have not yet been made.
The FÄ receives the required information by writing to the taxpayer or carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
This short and flexible form of audit does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proven successful in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of Information, Germany shall send the following information to the other member state: – via VAT ID no.(B) the amount of the tax payable by the taxable person in the member state in which the Taxable Person is established; (C) the amount of the tax payable by the taxable person in the member state in which the Taxable Person is established;
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC member states with the following information as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. the supply of new vehicles to traders without VAT no. b. distance sales (mail-order trade) to other EC member states not subject to VAT in Germany, c.significant deviations between the MIAS data reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other member states, d. intra-community supplies of goods which have been taxed incorrectly in Germany, e. potential "Missing Traders" having made intra-community transactions, regardless of whether is still valid or has already been deleted and F. taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries to potential "Missing traders" or to customers who have received a VAT ID no. used improperly.
Comparison and evaluation
The dispatch of the request for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the Initiative of the local SKILLS, which provide the CLO with the corresponding SCACVordrucke.
While the Czech CLO used bilingual SCACVordrucke (Czech-English) and information provided in the English or German language, the German SKILLS of the statement, request for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form is the only German to be drafted.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period 1. May 2004 to 31. As of December 31, 2005, the NKÚ noted that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information sent to Germany were only dealt with by the German financial administration within this period in 40.6% of the cases.
Although the German CLO points out the FA to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of responses to requests for information.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The Situation has changed in the meantime.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the tax offices of the response to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT Risk Management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of the tax administration deal with risk management in the field of Value Added Tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:
The VAT methodology and economic management department or its risk management unit is concerned with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and is evaluating the Trends in these risks in domestic and intra-community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic evaluated Were high-risk, prepares risk management in the field of value added tax conceptually and cooperates in this area with the competent EC institutions and the other member States.
The Department of international mutual assistance in the field of turnover tax shall exchange information, assist in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluate the data available in the MIAS System of other member states, provide public information and provide other forms of inter-state mutual assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The Department of tax audit methodology and tax intelligence carries out risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, defines priorities for the work planning of the financial director regarding the selection of cases to be examined, produces risk analyses to combat tax evasion, collects information from the tax administration and other sources in this context, and makes proposals for
Tax investigation offices exist at the financial directorates. Its tasks include the search for taxpayers and sectors that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, Gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxpayers (e.g. Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in chain fraud cases and the information of local tax authorities.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected cases.
These have regional jurisdiction and carry out tax audits on the basis of appropriate authorisation, also outside the local jurisdiction of the FA.
The need to set up special audit units resulted from the increase in the number of new and 'improved' forms of tax evasion identified, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units examine in accordance with the needs of the tax investigation offices or concentrate on taxpayers with specific activities, multinationals and taxpayers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms to reduce risks in the field of VAT have been integrated into the Atis System: – the 'credibility of VAT returns' task to assess the risk – bearing nature of tax returns issued; – the 'selection of taxpayers to be audited' task, whereby taxpayers to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria;-the 'MIAS' task, which gives financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC member states.
The "MIAS" task allows, among other things, the following: – verification of the validity of the VAT ID no. of taxable persons from other member states, – confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech Taxable Person, as indicated in the CTM by all suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other member states, – establishment of a list of taxable persons who have not submitted CTM, – formal control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their CTM in which VAT returns do not match the information on goods delivered to other member states with the information in the CTM, – establish a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns do not match the information on the value of goods purchased from other member states with the information in the CTM of all their suppliers from other member states13.
As part of their role in combating tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from state authorities such as Commercial Registers, Land Registry, motor vehicle registers, trades register, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to its federal structure, both the federal finance authorities (in particular the CLO) and the tax authorities of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the federal states have a single database.
At CLO level, unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as the 'kiss' Coordination Unit for special VAT checks and tax investigation measures) collects the fraud findings in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up at the kiss. There, the tax offices can enter the names of discovered Missing Traders or value added tax fraud and also query.
The kiss coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the kiss is incorporated into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal Review of the composition of signed for and on behalf. other member states which appear in the CTM of German taxpayers are carried out at the CLO.
This formal review is carried out before the CTM is transmitted to other member states in order to improve the reliability of Mia data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The verification of the validity in the ZM named USt-IdNr. done on the basis of O_MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other member states (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID no. See also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO RMS relies on MIAS data transmitted by the other member states and generates various types of communications to detect alleged Missing Traders. As indications, certain characteristics are used, which usually occur in Carousel transactions.
The FES of the Länder are required to deal with these communications and have to send the outcome of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to be sufficiently close to a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the Federal Ministry of education and research has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of indications when preparing the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour, the economic sector or the company's ownership interests.
A second level of risk management in the financial administrations of the Federal States and focuses on the processing of VAT returns and Annual returns.
For example, the System creates a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-community deliveries in their pre-VAT declaration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete submission of the ZM.
In addition, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions made by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the MIA data.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
- Suppliers and purchasers assume different dates for the execution of intra-community turnover;
- different accounting records and tax declarations of discounts and rebates.
In addition to the comparison of the information from the VAT declarations with the VIES data, many Federal länder have certain mechanisms of risk management, based on the information provided in the VAT declarations and certain other indications (e.g., company name, age of the owner/partner, number of employees, and payment of the Taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a fixed rules-based risk management system that enables a Team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules to filter out alleged tax fraudsters.
This System is used when Fä processes VAT returns.
This gives the responsible FA the information of the RMS before the value added tax is fixed.
Since this System is not learable, the risk managers must adjust the rules according to the feedback from the FA.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neuronal network based on the data of detected cases of backtracking.
Based on these data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The System creates a monthly list of tax cases where there are indications of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FEC shall decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the examination, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the examinations proposed by it.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neuronal network is used in combination with a regulation-based Fuzzy System.
Based on many data from processed VAT returns and some other indications, this Neuro-Fuzzy System (also called Datamining System) calculates how likely a taxpayer is entangled in tax fraud.
It then creates a monthly list of alleged tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FEC shall select the taxable persons concerned for examination and report the examination results to the data centre concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is in the States.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the expected effects will adjust during actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each member state has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German Länder mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European member states on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – in particular carousel fraud-has not proved to be a national Problem but a European Problem.
The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several member states.
A member state alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC member state. If this is not the case, fraudsters will seek out the member state with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide fraud in value added tax do not necessarily affect the member state in which the Initiator is established.
Any other member state involved in the fraud may be affected.
This is why a European exchange of experience on the RMS should take place.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales within the framework of the parallel audits, the NKÚ and BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and services.
Of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, which had doubts as to how they were to be carried out, or which the taxpayers of both states declared differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the Request of the BRH, the NKÚ checked a total of eight transactions between the eight Czech and German Taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxpayers had indicated in their tax returns and ZM, on the basis of notifications from the BRH.
At the Request of the NKÚ the BRH examined a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech Taxable person.
The relevant information was exchanged solely on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases revealed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC member states lead to the problems referred to in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German taxpayer.
When the Czech taxpayer declared a purchase of only € 29,869, the Czech Tax Administration sent a request for information to Germany to check the value of the goods delivered.
The German side stated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German taxable person in question had submitted to his Czech business partner in the 2. In the third quarter, the value of € 31,997 and in the fourth quarter, the value of € 10,276 were delivered.
Further, it appeared from the answer that the USt-IdNr. the German taxable person is not entitled to tax until 28 February 2015. It was valid until 30 September 2004. The German CLO, however, had given a further request from the German Taxpayer, and the validity of the VAT ID no. retroactive to 1. The court referred to the court for a preliminary ruling on 15 May 2004.
The German taxable person adjusted the ZM.
Based on this Information, it was a (intra-community) acquisition of Goods by the Czech Taxpayer.
By making a request to the relevant tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ noted that in 2004 the Czech taxpayer had submitted supplementary VAT returns for each (under -) tax period during which he declared a higher value of the acquisitions from other member states and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from the acquisitions from other member states.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible administrator of the Czech finance office could not clearly determine whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for Information, the NKÚ the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered in September 2003 as sales tax.
However, at the time of registration he did not have the allocation of a VAT-IdNr. only one tax number valid for Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany, a taxable person with retroactive effect a VAT-ID no. in 2006, the responsible administrator of the German financial administration retrospectively with effect from January 1, 2006. Retrieved May 15, 2007.
The German CLO assigned a USt-IdNr. retroactive, if the German trader has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO has caused the delay after the Taxable Person's request for a VAT ID no. manmade.
In this case, the CLO issued to the USt-IdNr. retroactive, because the entrepreneur according to § 6 UStG for an intra-community delivery no valid VAT-IdNr. requires.
Conversely, a German buyer does not need the (valid) VAT ID no. to declare the intra-community acquisition.
In view of these procedural differences between the member states, the German CLO issued the VAT ID no. in this particular case retroactive.
2.
In the framework of the international exchange of Information, the Czech tax administrator requested Review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
From the MIAS data results as the day of registration of the 5. In a registration certificate issued by the locally competent German FA, 1. It is reported as of 31 October 2004.
The German authorities informed the German authorities in their reply that the German taxable person was on 1 January 1999. However, for organisational reasons, it was not possible to register the company until 16 October 2004. A VAT-ID no. allotted.
At the request of the local Czech financial officials of the NKÚ learned that the financial official had carried out in the Czech Taxpayer a sales tax audit for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
In this examination, the tax office found that the Czech Taxpayer declared in its VAT return services in the amount of 9.897 CZK, which he had made to the German Taxpayer whose sales tax registration (i.e., before the 1. October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office imposed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 on the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
Due to the request of the NKÚ the BRH found that the German Taxpayer, the VAT-ID-no. it was only when he was assigned on 16 May 1895. The company was founded in 2004.
In addition, the FA registered it retrospectively from 1. In order to monitor the submission of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxable intra-community acquisitions from the Czech Republic amounted to 160 € (about 5,000 CZK).
3. 3. 4. In its VAT return for September 2004 and in its CTM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable supplies of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxable person.
When reviewing the registration of the German taxable person in the MIA System, the Czech tax officer noted that this registration was not possible until 11 December 2012. The contract was valid on November 30, 2004 and thus after the goods were delivered to Germany.
The Czech taxable person made a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales of domestic supplies worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
By a request from the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ, that the Czech Taxpayer was subsequently an application for review of the taxation procedure in terms of the supplementary VAT return. As proof, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxable person has been resident in Germany for 1 year. It was registered on 27 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official verified the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer as part of the international exchange of information.
The German Information showed that the German taxable person was not entitled to a tax until 11 December 2012. A VAT-ID no. it was granted.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to resume the tax procedure.
The BRH noted that there was no intra-community acquisition of goods in this case because the German taxable person was not able to obtain the goods until 11 December 2012. A VAT ID no. had received.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-community acquisition and the value added tax, and also called for the reimbursement of input taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
In addition, the BRH found that the company of the German taxpayer mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in confusion between two German taxpayers.
This change in the name of the German taxpayer was also confusing for Czech tax officials.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech Taxable Person of a German taxable person worth €22,686 in the first quarter of 2005.
By asking the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had examined with the Czech taxpayer, in the context of an external audit, whether the intra-community delivery had actually been effected and whether the Czech tax official had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech Taxpayer declared intra-community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier in the invoice, not its USt-IdNr. but only indicated his tax number for business within Germany.
According to the MIA's data, the German Taxpayer is only 21. April 2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech Taxable person for the VAT in connection with intra-community transactions registered.
The Czech tax administrator requested that the German financial administration should be a copy of the certificate of registration of the German Taxpayer, so that he could initiate an appropriate taxation method.
The Czech FA considered this business as the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private)Person in Germany and therefore did not establish a Value Added Tax for the acquisition of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, under German law, a taxable person supplying goods to other member states does not have a VAT identification number. for intra-community supplies, in order to be able to benefit from the VAT exemption for such supplies.
The supplier only has to pay the VAT no. of the purchaser in the other member state and can prove the Transport of the goods in question to the other member state.
In this case, the revenue is according to German tax law, a (tax-exempt) intra-community supply, which should be subject to acquisition taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-community transactions if they are below the minimum threshold of € 15,000: 5.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech Taxable Person acquired goods worth €12,561 from a German taxable person.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
As part of the Intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the verification of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech taxable person stated that he had not received the goods, had never been in business contact with the German company and that the acquisition of the goods in question had not been recorded in his accounts.
The German financial administration rejected the Request for the Transmission of Documents, contracts, orders, invoices, and transport documents – because of the turnover under € 15,000 and no other justification was given.
Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documentation for subsequent taxation of the acquired goods, the tax audit remained ineffective and the original tax was in place.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative" (Section 22 (A) – (e) UStG).
The German taxable person declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the German tax administration's replies to requests for information exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the Czech tax administration's replies:
6. What are you doing? In its audit, the NKÚ noted that the Czech financial administration was informed on 5 December of the results of its audit. A request for information on the value of im 4. Deliveries to Germany in the third quarter of 2004.
In the CTM for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person in the value of € 86,307; however, the Czech taxable person declared only the purchase of goods in the value of €35,314 for the same period in his VAT return.
In the reply to the request for information sent to the Czech Republic on 9 September, the commission sent a letter of formal notice to the applicant. The German side stated that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Since the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using a SCAC form, asked for the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person worth € 1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with indications of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ noted that at the time of its examination a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
By a request from the locally competent financial officials of the NKÚ found that the Czech Taxpayer declared in its VAT Declaration, the delivery of new motor vehicles at this German Taxpayer at a value of 11.816.103 CZK.
The Czech financial officials corrected the information in the tax Declaration and the Czech Taxpayer had an adjusted ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out at the German purchaser in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all motor vehicles in question had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. What do you mean? According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2004, a German Taxable Person purchased a car worth € 48,500.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-community acquisition.
By asking the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not issue tax returns even upon request by the tax officer. As a result, the FA continued to play a leading role on 23 May 2012. As of 31 May 2005, the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 was set at zero.
On the second day On 30 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to verify the said delivery by the German taxpayer.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax officer, the latter made a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
As the response to the request for information was not received until 7 December 2012, the commission decided not to proceed. The nkú audit was not known how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained from the international exchange of information until the end of the audit.
As a result of non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the Czech taxpayer's VAT registration became effective on 23 December 2007. It was deleted on August 15, 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and BRH the FA responsible had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested via a SCAC form, the Review of a in the third quarter of 2004 and delivery of motor vehicles to a German Taxpayer at a value of 16.991 €, with indications of carousel fraud templates.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech taxable person for deliveries worth € 16,335.
On the basis of the request of the NKÚ, the BRH noted that the external examination carried out by the Deutsche FA with the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer stated that the acquisition of goods worth € 16,335 was double the amount of his VAT advance notifications for the months of August and September 2004.
I don't know. In 2005, a Czech tax official requested, using a SCAC form, to review the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, worth € 198,167, with indications of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration submitted a partial request for information to the Czech Republic in which it confirmed that the German taxable person had purchased several motor vehicles and that, moreover, the investigation has not yet been completed in Germany.
The NKÚ noted that the local FA had carried out several external checks with the Czech taxpayer in order to check the deduction of above-average input taxes.
However, an unjustified claim was not established.
The BRH found that the German Taxpayer for the period concerned, in his VAT returns, had declared the acquisition of Goods from other member States in the total value of 579.114 €, and that the examination of the German FA is not completed at the acquirer in Germany.
In Section 4.4.1, the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-community acquisitions in the VAT return of the consignee and the information in the CTM of the supplier are described.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-community delivery were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to the MIA data, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth € 35,716 from the German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
As the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax officer and did not carry out any business activities at the legal seat of the company, the Czech tax officer asked for an international exchange of information on how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech Republic.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address indicated and the goods were collected by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was 155,000 €, but the German taxable person supplied only goods worth 21,659 €.
The Czech taxable person sent the German taxable person an incorrect payment confirmation for the amount of € 155,153 in favor of the German taxable person.
After detecting the fraudulent conduct of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the delivered Material with the exception of a part in the value of € 7,916.
By means of a request from the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ noted that the tax administration, on the basis of the information received, retrospectively applied to the Czech taxpayer, inter alia, the turnover tax on deliveries of goods from other member states in the amount of CZK 388,522.
On the basis of a request from NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had reported only one delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth € 7,916 after corrections.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxable person declared the withdrawal of the supply and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the withdrawal.
Its CTM contained the following information concerning Czech taxpayers:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested, by means of a copy of the SCAC code, the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question the Czech taxpayer had supplied to the German taxpayer goods with a total value of € 396,126 and provided services of € 11,885.
The NKÚ noted that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit with the Czech taxpayer to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and installed a production plant to the German company.
The Czech taxable person supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was manufactured on the basis of the order placed after 1 January 1999. May 2004.
The German taxable person did not remove the installed production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech Taxpayer calculated the German production plant for 107.100 € 11.885 € for services.
The German taxpayer received the tax but did not recognise it and did not pay it.
Upon request from the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ noted that all invoices had been duly recorded in the Czech taxpayer's books.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after May 1, 2004.
The BRH noted that the locally competent FA concluded, on the basis of the Czech financial administration's reply, that these transactions were a uniform (goods) supply of the Czech taxpayer to the German, including the assembly.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is installed.
The German customer for the supply of works is liable for VAT in accordance with the German Value Added Tax Act (Umsatzsteuergesetz).
At the same time, the recipient may claim an input tax deduction of the same amount.
Since the German taxable person's income from sales tax remained unchanged, the German FA did not make any adjustment to the VAT return.
This is the first time. According to MIAS data, Czech Taxable Person A acquired a machine worth € 58,000 from German Taxable Person C in February 2005.
The Czech tax official addressed a request for review of this Information to Germany.
As a response to the request for information, the German side informed that the German Taxpayer C supplied this machine in the year 2004, the Czech Taxpayer B, the have returned, however, in October 2004, the German Taxpayer C.
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not returned to Germany, but a branch of the German Taxpayer C in the Czech Republic transported.
From the response to the request for information revealed that the German Taxpayer C supplied to the machine in February 2005, the Czech Taxpayer A.
It received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) only took place within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-community delivery of goods.
Upon request from the local tax officer responsible for Taxable Person B, the NKÚ found that according to MIAS data, German Taxable Person C had supplied the Czech taxable goods (another machine) worth € 88,027 in the third quarter of 2004.
The Taxable Person B stated that he had not received the goods, so that the locally competent Czech tax officer addressed a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with taxable person B, the tax officer found that the machine, worth € 88,027, had not been booked with taxable person B and that it could be the same type of machine as the one supplied to the Czech Taxable Person A by the German Taxable Person C in February 2005.
The NKÚ also noted that the Czech tax officer responsible for Taxable Person A had carried out an audit with the latter.
The tax official had the account of the German Taxable Person C of 7 December 1912. In this case, the Taxable Person A is to be indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official noted that Taxable Person A had not recorded this invoice.
Taxable Person A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on September 9, 2012. It also provided Transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the Taxable Person A.
The BRH found that the German Taxpayer C have delivered the machine to the value of 88.027 € in the Czech Republic, but to another German Taxpayer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-community supply of goods, but a taxable supply within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not accept the German tax exemption C and corrected the information in its tax return.
The German taxable person d supplied the machine to the Czech Taxable Person B.
Under German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that German Taxable Person C had indicated in its CPM for the first quarter of 2005 the supply of a machine worth € 58,000 to Czech Taxable Person A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by Deutsche FA.
The chart below shows the contractual relationships between the counterparties involved in the above-mentioned transactions.

During the examination of requests for information received, the NKÚ noted that the Czech financial administration was informed on 4 December of the results of its investigations. A request for information from Germany had been received by a German tax official on 26 October 2005, asking for an inspection of intra-community supplies by a German taxable person worth € 879,680,625 to a Czech taxable person.
The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-community delivery of goods.
The German taxpayer had not been active in business since 1999.
The NKÚ noted that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit with the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company stated that it was a German taxpayer's claim against the German tax administration, which the Czech taxpayer claimed as a shareholder in the German company with the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official has not yet been informed that the German tax administration has dealt with the case with respect to the Czech taxpayer.
However, the amount in question is still stored in the MIA as an intra-community delivery from Germany to a Czech taxable person.
The main reason for this inconsistency was the failure to indicate intra-community acquisitions in the tax returns of beneficiaries (see Section 4.4.1 below):
This is the first time. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person supplied a Czech taxable product with a total value of €33,205 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-community acquisition.
The Czech tax official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the Intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person and that the other goods had been collected personally.
By request from the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ noted that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period concerned before receiving a response to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be resolved, so that the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxpayer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
This is the first time. According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a German taxable person had delivered goods to a Czech taxable person worth € 46,854.
For the same period, a Czech taxable person declared the intra-community acquisition of goods worth only €14,856.
In the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of Information, the Czech tax administrator requested Review of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent, showing a total value of the goods delivered of € 31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
Upon request from the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ noted that, after receiving the reply from Germany, the NKÚ had turned to the Czech taxpayer's accountant and remained with her in such a way that, after reviewing the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about the filing of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary VAT return has been submitted.
The Czech tax officer informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the time limits for retroactive VAT fixing would be respected for the relevant tax period.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German Taxable Person delivered goods worth € 11,600 to the German taxable person.
As part of the Intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for verification that the Czech taxpayers mentioned were indeed present, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had set up a number of sham firms in Germany.
In the course of the FA review, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.
However, according to the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not supplied by Germany to the Czech Republic, but resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer provided evidence for the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as a taxable person in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech financial officials provided this information in its response to the request for information to the German financial administration.
Upon request from the local Czech tax officer, the NKÚ noted that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, inter alia, the value of the goods which he had acquired from a German taxable person and at the same time claimed the right of deduction for the acquisition from other member states.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not report any VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax officer fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
Under Czech law, there was no acquisition of goods from other member states in this case, as the goods were not dispatched or transported from another member state to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official drew a false conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH noted that the German tax official immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of VAT of € 1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent to the actual recipient of the goods FA a control notification to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth € 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by a copy of the Czech taxable person's VAT registration certificate.
As a further annex was attached a photocopy of the passport of the Person who transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person mentioned in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that it had no contacts with a German taxpayer.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, was not issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information, the Czech tax official replied to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
Upon request from the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ noted that the Czech taxpayer is not domiciled at the address given in the commercial register and that the company's managing director is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period in February 2005, the Czech tax official established the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH noted that the locally competent German tax official had rejected the German taxpayer's right to exemption from VAT on this supply on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
It's not like it. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was not able to clarify a difference of € 3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT return and the values reported from other member states.
A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth € 89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond with the MIAS data, the German tax official asked for the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the Intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech Financial Officer stated that the only managing director of the Czech company was on 8 December 2008. A new managing director has not yet been entered in the commercial register.
The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a Relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer submitted a VAT return and a CTM, which had been signed after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register by a person not authorized to do so, that shareholder of the company.
The Accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax officer that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the goods invoiced in Euro into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
Upon request from the Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax administrator had acknowledged the Czech taxpayer's entitlement to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other member states of CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax administrator corrected the tax Declaration of the German purchaser, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German Taxpayer.
Since the earlier external audit did not show any signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to charge a fixed VAT liability.
It's a good idea. According to the MIAS data, a German Taxable Person acquired goods from the Czech Republic in 2005 worth € 4,251,196, after which he had purchased goods in the previous year worth € 43,274.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-community acquisitions in either its 2004 VAT return or the 2005 VAT return.
In addition, it did not declare any output sales corresponding to their value.
Due to these inconsistencies, the deutsche FA submitted a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2014. The first quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2005. Quarter 2006.
In the CTM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6. On 30 September 2006, the German side submitted a request for information in which it was requested to check whether the delivery had actually taken place, as reported by the Czech taxable person.
In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
The documents provided to the NKÚ by the relevant tax officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxable person, on 30 June 2009, the tax authorities of the Czech Republic issued a declaration of compliance with the tax code. A protocol on the start of the VAT assessment for the fourth quarter of 2006 was issued on 15 March 2006. The period from January to December 2005.
At the same time, the taxpayer was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for that period, but failed to do so.
According to the commercial register, the term of office of the single managing director was on 16. The board of directors expired on 15 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
Since April 2006, the Czech taxpayer has not submitted any sales tax returns.
In the context of the parallel examination, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two sais exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
This is the first time. A Czech company (UCR), which is not established in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct taxable transactions in Germany.
On the basis of this Information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID no.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish Customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German taxable person (UDE) established in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its own risk and for its own account for installation.
Because of the Assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the Transport carried out on his own behalf, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the Transport has started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC member state (AU) and the receiver is registered in an EC member state (CR) as taxable could be claimed for the delivery of the German Sub-contractor (BUILDING) no tax exemption, since the EC member state, for the delivery of another was determined as the seat of government of the Czech Unternehmens19.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the input tax deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the Transport has started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The supply of the other wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH noted that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-community deliveries in a uniform manner as intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ noted that (UCR) did not report intra-community deliveries to Austria but intra-community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion in this case.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs in order to show the size of the differences between the figures in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legal provisions of 2004.
The audited cases also show that it takes some time for taxpayers and the FA to apply the new legal provisions:
It's a good idea. In its CTM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable supply of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 reported to a German taxable person.
In the same period, another Czech Tax registered taxpayer in its ZM intra-community supplies to another German Taxpayer in a total value of 18.157.265 CZK.
From the information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ, it was found that in both cases electricity was supplied.
Both Czech taxpayers included the above-mentioned supplies in their CTM in accordance with Czech law no 235/2004 in force in 2004.
In a further review of these transactions, one of the Nkú's audit groups noted that in 2004 different legal provisions on the supply or purchase of electrical energy were in force between the Czech Republic and Germany.
While in the Czech Republic, the Taxpayer declared the deliveries of electrical energy according to the in 2004, the applicable Provisions of the act No. 235/2004 as intra - community supplies of goods, it was in 2004, and the applicable German statutory provisions, not an intra-community acquisition of Goods, but controllable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions in the Czech Republic have been eliminated by the adoption of law no 635/2004, which will take effect from 1 January 2004. As of January 31, 2005, some tax provisions were amended.
23. In the examination of intra-community supplies or acquisitions, in cooperation with the BRH has been further found that a Czech taxpayer declared payable in its ZM for the first and fourth quarter of 2005, intra-community supplies to a German Taxpayer in a total value of 240.411.163 CZK and another Czech taxpayer in its ZM for the same period, intra-community supplies to another German Taxpayer in the value of 263.470.776 CZK.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that in both cases it had been deliveries of electrical energy.
According to the wording of the from 1. Law no 235/2004 in force since 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place of performance for which the purchaser has its legal seat, registered office or permanent establishment for which the supply takes place.
Therefore, Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the supply of electricity in their CTM for 2005.
The fact that both the Taxpayer treated the supply of electrical energy in your ZM as intra-community supplies, in the VIES to a monetary difference of 503.881.939 CZK.
Final remark
Through the collaboration, the objectives of the BRH and NKÚ were achieved.
Both sais gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation disclosed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions occurred.
Some of them are worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both sais drew up recommendations for the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the Form of a control audit should be part of further observation.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both sais is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of Value Added Tax Administration.
