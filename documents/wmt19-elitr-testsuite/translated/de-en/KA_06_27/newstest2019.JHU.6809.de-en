Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasizes that the courts of auditors have the power to audit the entire public finances.
The statement calls for the courts of auditors to have the power to scrutinise tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the audit courts.
One of the most important steps on the way to optimising the audit work of a Court of Auditors is to develop a special strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is particularly true for taxes, which are the largest source of public income with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation can arise in which national audit bodies can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit bodies of other states.
As an example, the examination of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is required in the fight against such crimes.
Audit bodies in this area must be prepared to work closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the turnover tax as well as the MIAS system arose at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating audit courts first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
On the basis of the analysis of the available information, we made the selection of the subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem, and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to the improvement of the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of the sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT following the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(De) Examination of administrative co-operation in the field of value added tax in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The Commission's audit objective is:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the area of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.
(De) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT, in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to remedy them.
VAT information exchange system The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NK") and the Bundesrech-nungshof ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany, on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international mutual assistance between the financial authorities, and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the examinations was prepared in accordance with European Guideline 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The period under review covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two audit bodies.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of tax evaders, tax returns and summary notifications.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation with regard to cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for the purpose of VAT.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is to exceed the turnover threshold set out in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, tax evaders only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, for the purposes of turnover tax, the person entitled to tax will receive a tax number that applies only to domestic sales.
If the German tax authorities want to make intra-Community transactions, they must apply for a special identification number, the so-called UST-IdNr., to be issued.
As problems arise as a result of the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach is tax-free, but there is a right to deduct the advance tax.
In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to standardize the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, tax receipts have to be filed only for lower-year tax periods (month or quarter), tax evaders in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Pre-registration of sales tax and, after the end of the calendar year, an annual declaration of sales tax.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax authorities in Germany have to submit advance VAT declarations electronically.
The introduction of the directive on the electronic filing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While tax authorities in the Czech Republic are required to submit their summaries to the Financial Services (FÄ), German tax authorities are required to submit the summaries to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the FÄ in the Czech Republic will have access to the information from the summaries immediately after they have been submitted.
The information from the summary reports will only be available to German FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, up-to-date information on intra-Community sales is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summaries would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the update of the MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely review of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
In the event of requests for information, the Czech CLO will monitor compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the specified time limit.
Due to these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO that the deadlines be monitored on a permanent basis (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS), with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NAC and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EU Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the co-operation, the two audit bodies examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed through the use of CLO's legal capabilities, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the tax liability of the tax authorities concerned.
In these cases, the tax authorities either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not disclose the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the information requested.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax evaders have misrepresented turnover in their summaries.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly faulty, so that the staff (the FÄ) had to find out in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
CR examinations
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - "State Budget Income" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, North West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NK approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.
Examinations in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the Traffic Tax Division and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NK, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
In addition to interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following FÄ have been included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich bodies, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innstadt, Cologne, Stuttgart-Mitte, Cologne
In addition, talks were held with FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the examination were reported to the BMF in May 2007.
Co-operation between the two audit bodies
In the run-up to the parallel audit, a number of meetings were held between representatives of both audit bodies.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in each other's countries.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics for the parallel examinations were determined: 1.
Registration of tax evaders.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the handling of requests for information by financial officials and the review of selected problems identified in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the area of sales tax.
At a meeting in December 2006 to vote on the further examination of the NK and the BRH, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests that had already been achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000, will be eligible for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning turnover tax; hereinafter "Law No 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow for the retroactive registration of a tax collector if he has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or a business establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides value added tax services or benefits exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for the VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements mentioned in Law No 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, can voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure in accordance with Law No 337 / 1992 begins with the receipt of the registration application by the local financial officer.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you have to specify in your application the date from which you apply for registration as a value-added tax holder.
The financial officer must examine the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has any doubts about the information contained therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If, by means of a review, the financial officer has established that the entrepreneur meets the conditions for registration, he must issue a written notice on the registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the financial officer has to indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for the value added tax and the investment period for the sales tax.
The investment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the allotment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur, whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year, is entitled to choose the calendar month as the investment period and must inform the financial officer of this change.
The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The tax controller must provide the tax number for any communication (including payments) with the financial officer, and in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No 235 / 2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the encoding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification sign.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, as far as a specific law determines it. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law No 337 / 1992).
If the entrepreneur has failed to fulfil his obligation, despite a request from the financial officer, the local financial officer has to register him on his own initiative.
A communication will also be issued on this subject, which will be sent to the tax authorities.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business will receive a tax number on their first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as a tax payer.
According to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the tax law for the registration of turnover tax, the financial officer may require that the tax payer should have registered up to 10% of the proceeds from the tax law, which the person concerned has made unlawfully without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur was registered as tax collector, until the date on which the tax law was passed.
The payment of the amount set in this way is considered to be a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a tax payer can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the tax collector, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No 235 / 2004).
A tax controller can apply for the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force mentioned in the registration notice.
2) deletion of the registration on its own initiative (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004), if: A) the taxable person did not perform for 12 consecutive months and did not inform the financial officer of the reasons for doing so; b) the taxable person did not fulfil his obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004; c) the former tax person no longer meets the requirements for the tax penalty.
B) Tax persons without legal seat, registered office or premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic has neither his legal seat, place of business nor establishment, or a tax-exempt foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who, in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235 / 2004, has to make a tax return and pay taxes on these services ("non-resident").
He must submit an application for registration with the FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to indicate in this application all the UST ID numbers assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first tax-sensitive service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became subject to VAT on the day of the first tax-sensitive service provision in the Czech Republic, according to Law No 235 / 2004.
In the event of a retroactive registration, the FA Prague 1 has to demand proof (invoices or written explanations) of the performance from the companies concerned.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the FA Prague 1 is required to submit the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is entitled to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to submit tax applications or declarations and to pay tax.
In the examination of the NK, it turned out that in the case of the submission of a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for the filing of a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax evaders in Germany
According to the provisions of the tax ordinance (§ § 137, 138 AO), all business operations must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after the start of the business.
The municipality will forward the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been started, but has not been notified, it can also register the tax authorities on its own initiative retroactively.
In Germany, tax evaders, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are penalised for registering for Zwekke's sales tax if they meet the requirements set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (USTG).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
There is special responsibility for entrepreneurs based abroad.
For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of April 30, 2004, INSGE- and 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of March 1, 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the BRH's findings, these FÄ, with special responsibilities, frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed workers resident in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted following the accession of these ten countries to the European Union, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (appearances) self-employed persons do not meet the conditions laid down in Section 2 of the USTG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they are generally dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the way in which they perform their work.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill out a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a pre-print that is binding on all FÄ in Germany.
It will be processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the organizational units generally responsible for the tax assessment.
With the help of this requirement, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual tax person prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the controller, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to take part in intra-community trade, he needs a UST-IdNr in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for tax purposes.
The UST ID number will be automatically allocated by the CLO if the tax person declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT advance filings or in his annual VAT declaration.
The UST ID number is comprised of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (for example, if he ceases to do business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (investment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the UST ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the cancellation of the VAT number, so that the validity of the UST ID number can be terminated there at this time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (§ 19 (1) USTG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year, plus the resulting turnover tax, has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. The following year will probably not exceed the amount of €50,000.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay a turnover tax, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and make an annual VAT return.
A small business owner can explain the non-application of Section 19 (1) USTG.
This declaration will be binding for the next five years.
He is then allowed to charge the sales tax and deduct the advance tax.
Non-residents can appoint a fiscal representative (Section 22a of the USTG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the deduction.
The fiscal representative meets the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for the purposes of the sales tax.
The accounts state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold set out in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration process in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur in the individual federal states due to different organisational structures.
In the Czech Republic, at the time of its first registration, the person in charge of tax will receive a tax number for any tax.
In the case of his registration for the turnover tax, this tax number also applies to intra-Community sales.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who can register for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-community sales, he has to apply specifically for the allocation of a UST ID number.
Both the NAC and the BRH found that the German two-step registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which gives a single identification number for both national registration for VAT and intra-Community sales, could lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-step system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the tax payer does not register his business with the municipality or the relevant FA.
This retroactive registration allows for an accurate calculation of the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole of the EC should be standardised.
The German parliament recently approved the introduction of a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated to every natural person after birth by the Federal Central Office for Taxation.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person starts a business, the competent FA will apply for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a UST ID number.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of the UST ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of the numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduction of VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the carriage is carried out by persons registered in other Member States as taxable persons or by foreigners who are subject to tax in their own country.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus or coach, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as subject to VAT.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from the VAT requirement under the Act on the accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, the Czech Republic may maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport, either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or until the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b (1) USTG, a transport service will be carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not differentiate between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident person is transported through Germany, the part of the carriage, which originates in Germany, is considered to be a tax-free transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
The latter registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and gives a special certificate for each coach mentioned in the registration of the taxman.
The entrepreneur has to indicate his tax-sensitive transport services in a German tax return.
As of March 1, 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided for an entrepreneur resident in the country, the non-resident tax payer does not have to pay the turnover tax himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services must pay the turnover tax to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident tax payers, which is known as the "transfer of tax liability" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax collector and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the correctness of the tax return with regard to tax breaks:
Mobile customs control groups are examining the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the value added tax paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his tax return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out by the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established turnover tax, the FA can ask for mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters to be too burdensome in relation to the low cost of VAT on tax-sensitive passenger transport to check the VAT return or compliance with the tax penalty by a non-resident bus operator.
In particular, checking the books of a non-resident tax collector causes disproportionately high costs for the tax collector himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit can be expected to take more time than that of a resident tax resident, although the audit is limited to the number of passenger carriages taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, as far as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single carriage of persons is carried out, the taxable person must comply with all existing tax provisions in the various languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the financial authorities of the relevant EC Member States.
As a result, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger services leads to a disproportionately high administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States, as well as between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT under the Act on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax in accordance with the transport route that originates in German territory.
If a non-resident tax controller provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the relevant FA beforehand.
This registers the tax payer, who has to declare the tax-deductible portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax authorities registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The amount of tax in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high costs of investing in VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the carriage begins or where the service provider is based.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
To the extent that the law does not stipulate otherwise, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur will be penalised for issuing a VAT return on the pre-print provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiration of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the expiration of the deadline for filing the VAT return. In accordance with law no. 235 / 2004, the VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here, the due date of the tax is determined by the customs regulations.
If, as a result, there is an above-average deductible advance tax claim, this amount will be refunded to the tax payer within 30 days of setting this deduction, without the need to make an application for it.
The time limit is not applied in cases where the financial officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the tax payer.
In accordance with § 73 (11) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduct VAT can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct VAT arose.
At the end of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period, during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
In order to do this, however, it is necessary to submit a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Law No 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been invoked for the first time.
A tax collector must make a supplementary VAT return if: A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections that do not change the last known tax liability, but only change the previous information, c) he makes corrections to the turnover tax rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of Law No 235 / 2004.
A tax collector can make a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month, which follows the month in which the facts in question were established.
The sales tax declaration can be made electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The delivery via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.
The preprint for the VAT return contains separate lines for the indication of the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary checks within the framework of the Atis system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as subject to tax will be compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summaries.
With the help of MIAS, the value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as subject to tax will be compared with the information provided in the summaries of the tax authorities from other EC Member States.
Within the framework of the Atis system, the FA will carry out a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility test includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under that law.
Automated tax information system - automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its examination, the NK found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person in question in the event of a non-payment of the VAT return.
Filing and processing of tax returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registration and the annual VAT return.
Those who are penalised for submitting VAT advance applications must nevertheless make an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not hired to pay the VAT will have to make an annual VAT return.
The tax payers are, in principle, suspended until the 10th day after the expiration of the calendar quarter, in which the turnover tax is generated, to submit a pre-registration for VAT (§ 18 (2) USTG).
However, if the VAT debt in the previous year is more than €6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is penalised for submitting monthly VAT advance declarations no later than the 10th day after the expiration of the month in question.
The tax collector can also choose to submit monthly VAT advance applications if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (Section 18 (2a) USTG).
If the annual turnover tax is no more than €512, neither VAT advance declarations nor VAT returns are to be made.
A resulting VAT liability is to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
There are no (legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
As a matter of principle, tax returns, including refunds, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (surrender and / or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) USTG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the pre-registration of VAT and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly reports, a special advance payment must be made for this.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-filing period in December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance notification.
There is no "supplementary" tax return.
Once the VAT declaration to be filed by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur will no longer be able to correct an incorrect VAT advance notification, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the person in charge of the tax are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was made.
At the end of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of careless tax cuts or tax evasion.
The tax authorities are required to submit the VAT advance declarations electronically.
The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual tax return can be made in paper form or via the Internet, with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the tax payer must also make the statement on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT advance declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the tax payer.
In the event of a late charge, the tax payer can be charged with a delay surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier audit, the BRH found that the FÄ often did not charge this delay surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ levied the delay surcharges, the amount was set unevenly and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, particularly in the submission of the annual VAT return.
The preprint of the VAT return contains separate lines for information on the value of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT declarations filed on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated staff.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the tax authorities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to which all data are recorded electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The sales tax declarations selected in this way must be verified by the competent agent on the basis of the automatically drawn up inspection notices (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the value-added tax debt, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the tax payer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, the tax authorities must submit their advance applications no later than 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual VAT declaration must be made no later than 31 May of the following year.
The decision to issue an annual tax return has a number of advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax payer can correct the errors in the monthly advance filings by submitting a single VAT return;
- if the tax authority corrects its information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The federal states do not match MIAS data on intra-Community purchases of German tax evaders until the annual sales tax declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs have to make a tax return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This deadline will enable the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only check the level of turnover on the basis of the income tax declaration issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax authorities are pilloried for the electronic filing of the VAT advance application.
The introduction of the tax bill for electronic tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary messages
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit such summaries ("zm" below).
The value of the goods delivered is stated in the zm always in Czech currency, broken down according to the UST-IdNr7, the individual tax authorities under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
Tax payers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period will have to hand over the zm to the local FA at the latest on the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected within 15 days after the error has been detected.
Faulty data in the zm will always be replaced by the data from the correction zm.
Similar to the tax returns, the tax authorities can also surrender the ZM electronically.
If a tax collector does not give up zm or rectification zm, even though he is penalised for this under Law No 235 / 2004, the financial officer must ask him to surrender the relevant zm and, in so doing, assign the consequences of the non-levy. If non-monetary liabilities are not met, the financial officer is entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No 337 / 1992.
In its investigation, the NK found that the FÄ mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax evaders.
In particular, in the case of the ZM levy, the tax evaders are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to levy a ZM does not affect the amount of their tax liability.
According to Section 102 (5) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or rectification ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
If there is no agreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which The tax payer corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The financial officer will have to correct the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States in the Atis system if:
- the tax controller does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the zm (or rectification zm) and therefore corrects it by issuing a correction zm,
- the financial officer has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the tax authorities in the zm or rectification rate.
Corrections entered by the financial officer, without a correction rate being issued by the tax controller, do not replace the tax controller's decision to issue a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT is allowed to transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is carried out by the Department for International Mutual Assistance in the area of VAT in the Ministry of Finance), and the "O _ MCTL" message is automatically received by the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect UST-IdNr., which were specified in the transmitted ZM-lines.
If the incorrect UST ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry will be made to the list of the wrong UST ID.
The list includes a "Notification of doubts regarding UST-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the tax collector must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the corresponding lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech tax authorities in their VAT return and those of the supplier from the other Member State in its zm values for the delivery of goods will be passed on by the CLO to the relevant FA for examination.
The staff there will have to investigate the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
A) The value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant sections of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can be caused either by a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or by a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax authority, meanwhile, makes a supplementary VAT return on its own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information contained in the VAT return.
C) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech tax authorities in their VAT return, is higher than the value of their supplies reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is up to the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer gives the results of his review in Atis.
These results will be sent to the CLO.
For the individual quarters of 2005, the number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination can be seen in Figure 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO has decreased for each quarter of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Differences between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic buyer.
There may also be a mistake made by the tax authorities in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the ZM are indicated differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the FÄ examined can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Traders who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or take part in triangular transactions must surrender quarterly zm, in which intra-Community deliveries are listed according to purchasers (§ 18a (1) USTG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of the VAT advance applications, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM are to be handed over to the CLO.
Since January 1, 2007, the electronic levy has been punctuated.
The responsible FA can allow exemptions for individual tax breaks in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the tax payer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is paused to submit a correction within a month.
In the case of non-payment of the zm, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first remembrance - second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be imposed and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows for a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalties of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, Section 26a (1) No. 5 of the USTG determines that the tax payer acts unlawfully if he or she intentionally or lightly gives away a ZM not correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he or she does not correct a ZM or does not rectify it in time.
This infringement can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the FÄ, because the processing of the ZM is solely the responsibility of the CLO.
The data of the zm will only be stored with the CLO.
The information from the summarising messages will only be available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect UST ID number in the ZM German tax authorities, the German CLO will receive a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the correct data.
If the CLO fails to get the correct information, the case will be handed over to the relevant FA.
It is then up to him to ask for the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the UST ID number at the request of the CLO.
However, the memory, as well as the threat and imposition of up to three consecutive fines, takes too much time when a tax evader may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were eventually reported to the competent FÄ, were usually completed within one to two months.
The relevant FA refused to grant the tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases.
If the taxman presented the correct UST ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected zm.
Therefore, the tax authorities often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, no comparison is made between the information given in the VAT advance declarations or the VAT return on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before these data are sent to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ, which is usually done in the preparation of a special VAT check.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect UST ID numbers will be identified and reported to the affected Member States.
The data will be used to control employment tax in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications will be drawn up and sent to the relevant FÄ.
This happens on an ongoing basis, whereas the acquisition data of all VAT holders is later compiled and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment process then compares this data with those for intra-community purchases.
The system checks fully (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the advance tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax evaders who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State will have to surrender a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and transmit the data to the CLO.
In the case of FÄ, the values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax authorities will be compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the framework of the tax setting.
In Germany, tax evaders who have made intra-Community deliveries are liable to pay quarterly interest within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM will only be available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax authorities only indicate the deliveries of goods in the ZM.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot itself correct incorrect information in individual lines of the ZM issued.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect UST ID number was not corrected even if the tax controller reported the correct UST ID number to the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries, which German tax authorities make in their VAT advance declarations, with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the data from the pre-registration and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German CLO sends the MIAS data to other Member States.
On the basis of the BRH's findings, it is clear that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
The data provided by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech tax authorities will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods provided by the Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes a separate comparison for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations will be referred to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community purchases.
Such general control will only be carried out in the case of tax evaders who are not fully entitled to deduction.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community purchases by other tax authorities if the RMS has drawn up an audit notice or if the tax authority has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves FÄ of the need to clarify the reasons for the differences that arise.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, up-to-date information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.
The current ZM system, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that may well be six months old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax payers had to surrender monthly zm.
The monthly levy would only increase the administrative burden insignificantly, since the majority of tax evaders in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-filings, and for which no more information is required than for the VAT returns or advance declarations.
In order to avoid red tape, the levy of the zm could be linked to the submission of VAT returns or advance declarations.
However, a break with the monthly levy of zm would create more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community purchases, and would increase the flow of data between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly zm.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the allocation to the monthly levy to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is set out in Table 2.
Both audit bodies requested data on the number of false tax numbers or UST ID numbers in the O _ MCTL reports, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.
This data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different basis for calculating the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the zm was submitted, the German CLO refers its numbers to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL reported.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions as well as on the tax authorities who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of value added tax, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: Exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out through a request for information (Request for Information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic are sending their RFI or their responses to a received RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO, which is concerned about translating the information provided in the standardised SCAC preprint into the foreign language and passing it on to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the responses to sent requests. It is concerned about their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the relevant FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from the date of receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period have been examined by the NK.
Out of a total of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%), this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NK. More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, a reply was received in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and, in 19 cases, no reply had been received from Germany (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to find out when the information was given).
More detailed information on the deadlines for responding to requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community turnover stated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The chart above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information were mostly worth over €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for setting the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected from the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-determined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transfer of previously determined information to another Member State, without its prior request, as soon as the information in question is available.
In the automatic exchange of information, the Czech Republic informs the other Member States about deliveries of new vehicles.
The financial officer receives this information from the pre-print notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No. 235 / 2004, as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer inserts the required data into the relevant document template and forwards it directly to the responsible staff of the financial directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which these data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, namely within two months at the latest after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on mail-order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."
This information will be transmitted to the other Member States by means of an SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local FA.
The FÄ will send the completed SCAC 2004 preprint directly to the German CLO via e-mail, which will forward the SCAC pre-prints to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCACpre-print used is unique.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State, or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community deliveries from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information on a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO is concerned about the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC preprint [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are not written in German or English.
In response to the request for information, the CLO directs it to the relevant FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary staffing capacity to remind the FÄ to respond to the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ will receive the information they need by writing to the tax authorities or carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: The VAT special audit, which covers all tax-sensitive transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
In this short and concise form of examination, it is not necessary to make an announcement to the tax authorities, and it has proved its worth in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany will provide the other Member State with the following information: - via UST-IdNr., which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of the input tax to traders established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has agreed to provide the following information to the other EC Member States as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States, which are not subject to turnover tax in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the purchases reported by a tax authority and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods that have been improperly subject to taxation in Germany, have already been misused, or have been misappropriated by the Community.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information is carried out both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local FÄ, who transmit the corresponding SCACpre-printed information to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACpre-prints (Czech-English) and translates information provided into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instructions, requests for information or spontaneous information on a one-language preprint only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NAC found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were only completed in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of requests for information that have been answered for a limited period of time.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a continuous process of remembrance.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities to respond to the outstanding requests for information.
Value-added tax risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of turnover tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department for Methodology and Economic Management of Value Added Tax, or its risk management unit, is looking at identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluating trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the criteria for "the credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect potential tax evasion within the framework of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares the risk management in the area of turnover tax conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The department for international mutual assistance in the area of value added tax provides, among other things, for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and implementation of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system in other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental mutual assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Tax Audit and Investigation Methodology Department conducts, among other things, risk analyses within the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets out priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, compiles risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigators are in charge of the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax evaders and industries that are at risk in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax evaders (e.g. in the sectors of internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of misappropriation in the case of chain fraud.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected FÄ.
They have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in the number of new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators, or focus on tax professionals with specific activities, multinational companies, and tax professionals with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of value added tax have been integrated into the Atis system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk of tax returns, - the task of "selecting the tax authorities to be audited," selecting the tax authorities to be audited on the basis of certain criteria - the task of "MIAS," which provides financial officials with access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task allows, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the UST ID number of tax payers from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax authority, as stated in the zm of all suppliers of the tax revenue from other Member States, tax returns from other Member States, tax returns from other Member States, and tax returns from those Member States, which have not been submitted to them, - formal control of the information in the tax information in the Czech Republic.
As part of their mission to fight tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from state authorities such as commercial registers, land registry offices, motor vehicle registrars, business registers, etc.
More detailed information on this can be found in section 4.4.1 of the submission and processing of the summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
In the Federal Republic of Germany, due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial authorities of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial authorities of the federal states have a fully unified set of data.
At the level of the CLO, the ST I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as the "Kuss" - Coordinating Centre for Sales Tax Examining and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on cases of fraud in the Opus database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called Zauber was set up at the kiss, where the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or sales tax fraudsters.
The Kuss coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at the national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the kiss will be incorporated into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. of other Member States, which appear in the German tax authorities, will be carried out by the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the ZM is sent to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and, therefore, its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validation of the validity in the so-called UST ID number is carried out on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers provided by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid UST ID, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on MIAS data provided by other Member States and generates various types of communications to detect suspected missing traders. As evidence, certain features are used, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features need to be included in order to be sufficiently likely to suggest a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has advised the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the messages.
The risk management system should also take into account other points of reference, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the industry or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial authorities of the federal states and focuses on the processing of the VAT advance declarations and the annual declarations.
For example, the system compiles a list of those who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT advance notification or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the CLO to monitor the full delivery of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the tax collector in his annual tax return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial authorities of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
- Supplier and acquirer are based on different dates for the execution of intra-Community turnover;
- Different accounting and tax declaration of Skonti and discounts.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms, which are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owners / shareholders, number of employees and method of payment of the tax authorities).
Bavaria has introduced a rules-based risk management system that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are singled out.
This system is used in the processing of the VAT advance reports by the FÄ.
As a result, the competent FA receives the advice of the RMS before the turnover tax is set.
As this system is not capable of learning, risk managers will have to adjust the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neuronal network based on the data of detected cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FÄ will decide on the audit of the tax authorities in question.
After the audit, the tax examiners will have to report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it has proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the datamining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax collector is involved in tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the tax authorities concerned for examination and report the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.
Whether the hoped-for effects will materialise in actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in the present report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NAC and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three German states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
At the moment, there is an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State cannot develop an effective RMS on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in every EU Member State. If this is not the case, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In the context of the parallel tests, the NK and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and / or
Which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial authorities of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, which were in doubt about their execution, or which the tax authorities of both states explained differently in their tax returns, or at least in different ways.
At the request of the BRH, the NK investigated a total of eight business transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax authorities.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of BRH communications, the NK examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax authorities had stated in their tax returns and zm.
At the request of the NK, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax evaders.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax collector.
When the Czech tax authorities declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech financial administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In response to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax authority in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
Furthermore, it emerged from the reply that the UST ID number of the German tax authority was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had accepted a further request from the German tax authority and had brought forward the validity of the UST ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax watchdog corrected the zm.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax authorities.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NK found that, in 2004, the Czech tax authority had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (lower-year) tax periods in which it declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States, while at the same time seeking the deduction of pre-tax from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the responsible person in charge of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was also included in the declared acquisitions.
In response to a request for information from the NK, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered in September 2003 as subject to VAT.
At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a UST-IdNr., but only a tax number, which ultimately applies to Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a UST ID number to a tax payer, in 2006 the responsible person in charge of the German financial administration did so retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO grants a UST ID number retroactively if the deut entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay following a request from the tax collector to grant a UST ID number.
In this case, the CLO grants the UST ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not require a valid UST ID number for an intra-Community delivery according to Section 6 of the USTG.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) UST ID number of its supplier to explain the intra-community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the UST ID number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for a review of the German entrepreneur's tax registration.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities said that the German tax collector had been registered on 1 October 2004, but had not been allocated a UST ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005 for organisational reasons.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NK learned that the financial officer had carried out a sales tax audit for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech tax collector had declared in his VAT return services to the value of CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German tax authorities prior to their registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office set a tax liability of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 vis-à-vis the Czech tax authorities.
On the basis of the request from the NK, the BRH found that the German tax authority had only been allocated the UST ID number when it notified the FA of its company, which was founded in 2004, on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA retroactively registered him as of 1 October 200415 for the purpose of VAT, in order to be able to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the tax collector reported intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In its sales tax return for September 2004, as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax receipt of goods worth CZK 114,615 was issued to a German tax collector.
When reviewing the registration of the German tax collector in the MIAS system, the Czech financial official stated that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004, and therefore after the goods were delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax collector issued a supplementary sales tax return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries of CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
In response to a request from the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NK found that the Czech tax authority subsequently filed an application to reopen the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, it submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax authority had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech financial officer verified the validity of the registration of the German tax collector in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to the German information, a UST ID number was not allocated to the German tax authorities until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech finance official rejected the request to reopen the tax procedure.
The BRH found that, in this case, there had been no intra-Community purchase of goods, because the German tax collector had only received a UST ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient explained both the purchase as an intra-Community acquisition and the value added tax on it, and also demanded the reimbursement of advance taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German tax collector, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German tax authorities named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax authorities.
This change in the name of the German tax authorities also confused the Czech finance officials.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German finance official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax collector of €22,686 from a German tax collector.
In a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NK found that the Czech financial officer had checked with the Czech tax officer during an external audit whether the intra-municipal delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax officer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax collector did not explain the intra-communal acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax collector will not be registered for the turnover tax in connection with intra-Community sales until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax authorities.
The Czech finance official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax collector, so that he could initiate an appropriate tax procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the purchase of goods from a non-business (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose any sales tax on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, under German law, a tax collector who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a shipment.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's UStId number in the other Member State and must be able to prove that the goods in question have been transported to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to employment tax in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum salary limit of €15,000: 5.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German tax collector.
The Czech finance official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the context of intergovernmental mutual assistance, the Czech financial administration asked for the examination of this supply of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech tax expert explained that he had not received the goods, had never been in a business relationship with the German company, and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech financial officer did not receive documentation for a subsequent tax on the purchased goods, the tax audit remained inconclusive, and the original tax provision remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the NK, the BRH found that the German tax authority acted as a "fiscal representative" (§ 22 (a) - (e) USTG).
The German tax expert explained these deliveries in his tax return and in the ZM.
His right to a tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. In the course of its examination, the NAC found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech financial authorities had sent a request for information on the value of Wa-rendition deliveries to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the zm for this quarter, the German tax authorities had reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax authorities only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period in their VAT return.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period set out in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side indicated that the request for information could not be processed, since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documentation necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using an SCAC template, asked for a review of the delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax collector in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, worth €1,265,554, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NAC noted that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request to the local financial officer, the NK found that the Czech tax collector had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new vehicles to these German tax authorities in the value of CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech financial officer corrected the information in the tax return, and the Czech tax officer issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not pass on this request for information to the local FA for examination.
According to the BRH communication, a special VAT check was carried out by the German purchaser in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all the vehicles in question had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold to other tax holders in Germany.
8. According to MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech tax collector purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German tax collector.
However, the Czech tax authority did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In a request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NK found that the Czech tax collector had not made a return on sales tax since August 2004.
The Czech tax collector did not make any tax returns even after being asked to do so by the financial officer. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period from October to December 2004 at zero.
On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German tax authorities.
As the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the financial officer, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known, until the conclusion of the examination of the NK, how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
As a result of the failure to comply with the provisions of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax collector was cancelled with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial word was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NK and the BRH, the relevant FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial officer, using an SCAC template, requested a review of the delivery of motor vehicles in the third quarter of 2004 to a German tax payer worth €16,991, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his response to the request for information, the German financial official stated that he only had the invoices for deliveries worth €16,335 issued by the Czech tax authorities.
On the basis of the request from the NK, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the purchaser in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT advance filings for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using an SCAC template, requested a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005 to a German tax payer worth €198,167, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax collector had purchased several vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NAC found that the local FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech tax authorities in order to check the deduction of above-average pre-tax rates.
However, an unauthorised claim has not been established.
The BRH found that for the period in question, the German tax authority had declared in its VAT declarations the purchase of goods from other Member States for a total value of €579,114, and that the examination of the German FA by the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the receiver's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German tax authority, but the Czech tax authority did not declare the acquisition.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the financial officer and there was no business activity at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech financial officer requested, as part of the international exchange of information, a review of how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech.
The German response to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax authorities were unknown at the given address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax authorities sent the German tax authorities a false payment confirmation of the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax authorities.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech buyer, the German tax collector, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the delivered material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
In a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NK found that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech tax authorities, the financial administration subsequently carried out, among other things, the sales tax on goods delivered from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
On the basis of a request from the NK, the BRH confirmed that, following corrections, the German supplier had only reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authority declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested, by means of a SCACpreprint, a review of the supply of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax collector had delivered goods worth a total of €396,126 to the German tax authorities and provided services worth €11,885.
The NK found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit with the Czech tax authorities in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax authorities had supplied and assembled a production plant for the German.
The Czech controller delivered the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC, and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after May 1, 2004.
The German tax collector did not take down the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax authority charged the German production facility for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax collector received the receipts, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
In a request to the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the NK found that all invoices on the books of the Czech tax collector had been duly recorded.
The sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax authorities, which related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply from the Czech financial administration, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax payer to the German, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the work supply owes the sales tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
As the turnover liability of the German tax authorities remained unchanged, the German FA did not request a correction of the VAT return.
13. According to the MIAS data, in February 2005, Czech tax collector A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax collector C.
The Czech finance official sent a request to Germany for a review of this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax authority C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax authority B in 2004, but that it had returned it to the German tax authority C in October 2004.
According to information provided by the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax authority C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it also emerged that in February 2005, the German tax authority C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax authority A.
He picked up the machine at the headquarters of the German tax office in the Czech Republic.
As this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no internal supply of goods.
In a request to the local financial officer responsible for the tax case B, the NAC found that, according to MIAS data, the German tax authority C had delivered €88,027 worth of goods (another machine) to the Czech tax authorities in the third quarter of 2004.
Tax officer B said he had not received the goods, so the local Czech finance official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with the tax authority B, the financial officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been recorded with the tax authority B and that it could be the same type of machine that the branch of the German tax authority C had delivered to the Czech tax authority A in February 2005.
The NAC also found that the Czech financial officer responsible for tax liability A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The financial officer had the invoice of the German tax authority C of 7 February 2005, in which the tax authority A is indicated as the receiver of the machine.
The Czech finance official noted that the tax-payer A had not recorded the bill.
The taxman A had signed a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also took care of the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the tax collector.
The BRH found that the German tax authority C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax authority D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-free delivery within Germany.
As a result, the German finance official did not recognise the claim of the German tax authority C for VAT exemption and corrected the information in its tax return.
The German tax controller D delivered the machine to the Czech tax controller B.
According to German law, this shipment was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that, in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005, the German tax authority C had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax authority A.
This delivery was not verified during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below represents the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NK found that, on 4 October 2005, the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German financial official requested the inspection of intra-Community deliveries of €879,680,625 to a Czech tax collector.
The German finance official said that there was a suspicion that this was a frenzied intra-community supply of goods.
The German tax collector has not carried out any active business activity since 1999.
The NAC found that the Czech financial officer had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax authorities.
The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim made by the German tax authorities against the German tax authorities, which the Czech tax authorities had asserted as a shareholder in the German company to the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NK, the Czech financial official has not yet been informed that the German financial administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax authorities.
It is clear from the available information that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax collector.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the failure to disclose the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax collector supplied a Czech tax receiver with a total value of €33,205.
However, the Czech tax authority did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.
In its response to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax collector had dispatched part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax collector, and that he had personally picked up the remaining goods.
In response to a request from the local Czech tax official, the NK stated that, prior to receiving a reply to the request for information, the Czech tax authority had issued an additional VAT return for the period in question.
Nevertheless, the differences in the value of the purchases could not be clarified, so the Czech financial officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech tax authorities.
This examination has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German tax collector had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax collector.
For the same period, a Czech tax collector declared the intra-EU purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial official asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German reply to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax authorities and the MIAS data.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NAC stated that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax authority and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about issuing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no additional VAT return has been issued.
The Czech financial official told the NK that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT setting for the tax period in question would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax authorities delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax authorities.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial official asked for an examination of whether the aforementioned Czech tax authorities actually existed, as the alleged capital owner of the German tax authorities had set up a number of bogus funds in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax authorities confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authorities, however, the goods were not shipped from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were sold on in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax expert presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax collector was not registered in Germany as subject to VAT and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany, and the Czech finance official provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German financial administration.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NK found that the Czech tax collector had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which, among other things, he declared the value of the goods he had purchased from a German tax collector and, at the same time, asserted the right of deduction for the purchase from other Member States.
In his Czech sales tax return, he did not register any sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return, which had been issued after the external audit, the Czech financial officer fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech law, in this case, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
As a result, the Czech financial officer drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German financial official corrected the tax return of the German tax collector and demanded the payment of VAT worth €1,600.
In addition, the relevant FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods, in order to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, contractors declared intra-community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech finance official received a request for information from the German tax administration on whether the Czech tax collector had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax authority in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied as an attachment by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax authorities.
A photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have carried the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had no contact with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech financial officer responded to the request for information and, at the same time, stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the NK stated that the Czech tax collector does not have his seat at the address indicated in the Commercial Register and that the managing director of the company is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech financial officer set the tax liability of the Czech tax collector at zero.
As part of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial official had rejected the German tax authority's claim to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax collector should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax collector in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax authorities was not in line with the MIAS data, the German financial officer asked for verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his response to the request for information, the Czech finance official said that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax collector issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by a person not authorised to do so, namely the company's shareholder, following the deletion of the managing director in the Commercial Register.
The accountant of the Czech tax office informed the financial officer that the owner of the capital had deposited the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts have not been issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NK found that the financial officer had accepted the Czech tax authority's claim for VAT exemption for goods delivered to other Member States, worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German financial officer did not correct the German buyer's VAT return, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax collector.
Since the previous external audit showed no evidence of tax fraud, there is no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax collector purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, according to which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German tax expert did not explain the intra-Community acquisitions either in his 2004 tax return or in the 2005 tax return.
In addition, he did not declare any corresponding initial sales in terms of value.
Due to these inconsistencies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community deliveries of goods totaling CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax authorities had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech Finance Administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
It can be seen from the documents provided to the NK by the competent financial officer that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax authority, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the commencement of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.
At the same time, the tax payer was asked by the financial officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech tax collector has not issued any tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NK, in collaboration with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two audit bodies exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the relevant FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do tax-sensitive business in Germany.
On the basis of this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German UST-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf of, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax authority (Ude), which is based in Germany.
The following illustration depicts the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account to be installed in Austria.
Due to the installation, its delivery will take place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines will be controllable in Austria.
- Because the forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in his own name, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (Ude) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as subject to tax in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (Ude), as the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the seat state of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany, and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The location of the delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) delivered both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria as well as intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare in its German tax returns or in its domestic deliveries to the German CLO.
As a result, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NAC found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, it would be necessary to cooperate with at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although in this case there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NAC and the BRH examined case designs in order to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation in 2004 between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for the tax authorities and the FÄ to apply the new legislation:
22. In its zm for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax collector reported deliveries of goods totaling CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax collector.
During the same period, another Czech tax collector reported a total value of CZK 18,157,265 in his intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector.
From the information provided by the BRH to the NK, it emerged that in both cases it was a matter of electricity supplies.
Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in accordance with Czech Law No 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NK found that in 2004 there were different legal regulations governing the supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the deliveries of electrical energy to be intra-Community deliveries in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legislation in force in 2004 it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and tax-sensitive sales in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. In the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax collector, in his ZM for the first and fourth quarter of 2005, made intra-Community deliveries to a German tax collector with a total value of CZK 240,411,163, and another Czech tax controller, in his ZM for the same period, declared intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector at C3.76.
Information sent from the BRH to the NK showed that in both cases it was a matter of supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No 235 / 2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal seat, place of business or place of business for which the delivery takes place.
For this reason, the Czech tax authorities should not have indicated the electricity deliveries in their zm for 2005.
The fact that both controllers treated the supply of electrical energy in their zm as intra-Community deliveries led to a pay difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Conclusion
Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NK have been achieved.
Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations that govern the VAT administration.
During the parallel examinations, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions were revealed.
For some of them, it is worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both audit bodies drew up recommendations on the management of turnover tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the collaboration between the two audit bodies is the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the area of VAT administration.
