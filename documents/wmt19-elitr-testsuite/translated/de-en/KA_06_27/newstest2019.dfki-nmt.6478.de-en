Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the courts of auditors are authorized to audit all public finances.
The statement requires that the courts of auditors have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.
The organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the Sixth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the courts of auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit work of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is particularly true of taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, a situation may arise where national audit bodies can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with other states' audit bodies.
As an example, the examination of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant losses of revenue in many states.
The fight against such crimes requires cooperation between the authorities.
Audit bodies in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the turnover tax and the MIAS system was developed at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn, which was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of thorough preparation, the Audit Bodies involved first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the analysis of the available information, we made the selection of the subject-matter for the examination planning.
Achieving the efﬁcient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC member states) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but will also provide the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
File number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject-matter of the examination:
(CZ) administration of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(de) examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The aim of the Commission's audit is to:
(CZ) the objective of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the Financial Administration in the area of VAT after the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "the EC") with the free movement of goods and services and the use of mias1, in particular the control of the claim of VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.
(de) The objective of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("nkú") and the Federal Audit Court ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained by international administrative assistance between the financial authorities and the comparison of the turnover tax management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The period under review covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects have also been examined, such as the registration of tax evacuees, tax returns and summary notifications.
The audit also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany, business owners are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is to exceed the turnover threshold laid down in the Turnover Tax Act.
In the Czech Republic, tax payers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax payer receives a tax number that applies only to domestic sales for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German tax-resident wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the issuance of a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is tax-free, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).
3) tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic, tax-deductible VAT returns are only required for tax periods of less than one year (month or quarter), tax payers in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Pre-Registration of VAT and a declaration of VAT after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany have to file VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The introduction of the right to electronic sales tax returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech Financial Administration (see 4.3).
4) summary messages.
While tax payers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax authorities (FÄ), German tax payers have to submit the summary reports to ClO2.
Accordingly, FÄ in the Czech Republic will have access to the information from the summary reports immediately after they have been submitted.
The information from the summary reports is only available to Germans after they have been processed by the CLO.
To combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary messages would shorten the period between the date of sales and the update of MIAs data.
This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.
5) international exchange of information in the area of sales tax.
In the case of requests for information, the Czech clo will monitor compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German clo does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German Financial Administration has carried out a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the specified period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German clo a constant monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) risk management.
Each of the two Member States is to develop its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The ncú and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using CLO's legal options, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The courts of auditors noted the following:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the tax liability of the tax payers concerned.
In these cases, tax evaders had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or failed to declare the purchase of goods in their VAT returns.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal regulations in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been revealed where tax evaders misstated sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the officers (the FÄ) had to determine in these cases (see 6).
Examination proceedings
Examination procedures in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State budget revenues" and the territorial audit departments of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, southern Bohemia, southern Moravia, Central Moravia and northern Moravia.
The audited positions were: the Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of ncú approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.
Examination proceedings in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the Traffic Taxes and employees of the associated PAB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the Work Plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the nkú, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the test was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following areas were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Stadtmitte, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
Talks were also held with the FÄ Augsburg City, Aurich, Düsseldorf's Old Town, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The test results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors took place.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the financial administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics for the parallel tests were determined: 1.
Registration of tax evaders.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the way in which financial officials handle requests for information and review of selected problems mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the VAT area.
At a meeting to vote on the further examination of the ncú and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months, will be paid on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (Section 94 (1) of Law no. 235 / 2004 Coll., on turnover tax; hereinafter "law no. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a tax payer if he has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides VAT-related services or benefits exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other conditions specified in Law no. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet the requirements set out in the law, may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
Upon receipt of the registration application by the local financial officer, the registration process begins in accordance with Law no. 337 / 1992.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must indicate in your application the deadline date from which you apply for registration as a VAT resident.
The Financial Officer must examine the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all assets.
If he has doubts about the information provided, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the financial officer has verified that the entrepreneur meets the conditions for registration, he must give a written notification of the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the Communication, the Financial Officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the tax assessment period.
The taxation period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the preceding calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 is entitled to choose the calendar month as a period of taxation and has to inform the financial officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The tax payer has to provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the financial officer, as well as in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. law No. 235 / 2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification sign.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, as far as a special law determines it. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law no. 337 / 1992).
If the Entrepreneur has not complied with his obligation despite a request from the financial officer, the local financial officer has to register him ex officio.
A communication will also be issued to the tax payer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business receives a tax number for any type of tax at the time of their first registration.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
In accordance with Law no. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the law on the registration of the turnover tax, the Financial Officer may require that the tax payer obtain up to 10% of the proceeds of the tax-related turnover, which the person concerned has unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a tax payer, until the date on which on which the registration as tax payer was made by order of the Financial Officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
The payment of the amount set in this way is considered to be a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law no. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a tax payer can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of the registration at the request of the tax payer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the registration threshold (section 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
A tax payer can request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the effective date specified in the registration notice.
2) Cancellation of the registration ex officio (section 106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004), if: a) The tax resident did not perform for 12 consecutive months and did not inform the Financial Officer of the reasons for this, b) the tax resident did not fulfil his obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004, C) the previous tax resident did not meet the requirements for tax protection any more fulfilled.
B) tax evaders without legal domicile, place of business or premises in the Czech Republic a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic does not have a legal domicile, place of business or establishment, or a tax eventer who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for such services or supplies in accordance with Section 108 of Law no. 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur")) will be tax-deductible with the provision of the service in question.
He must file an application for registration with the Prague 1 Company no later than the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to indicate in this application all UST identification numbers assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first tax-deductible performance in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 company will have to register him retroactively, as he became subject to VAT in accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004 on the day of the first tax-deductible performance in the Czech Republic.
In the event of a retroactive registration, the Prague 1 company shall require the relevant companies to provide proof of performance (invoices or written explanations).
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the company Prague 1 has to request the presentation of the contract documents which provide the basis for the service.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of section 106 (9) of Law no. 235 / 2004, the Financial Officer is authorized to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax applications or declarations and to pay taxes.
When examining the ncú, it emerged that in the event of a tax return by mail sent abroad on January 25, that is, according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the Fa until January 31.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of registration, become known to the Fa later than 31 January, the cancellation of the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question is no longer possible.
Registration of tax payers in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the Tax Code (§ § 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business activities.
The municipality will forward the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has been started but not notified, it can also register the tax payer ex officio retrospectively.
Tax payers in Germany, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are required to register for zwekke VAT if they meet the requirements of Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special responsibility lies with foreign entrepreneurs.
For example, the chemnitzsüd company is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
On 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with the company; on 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the BRH, these authorities, with special powers, refused to register so-called false self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten states to the EC, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (sham) self-employed persons do not fulfil the conditions for recognition as entrepreneurs specified in § 2 UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single client, who determines their working time and the type of work execution.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill out a questionnaire from the relevant Fa and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the FÄ or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
With the help of this imprint, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual tax payer before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the relevant Fa, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the Fa, the following five (or four) digits are the identifying feature for the tax payer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This will be allocated by the clo on request if the Entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the tax payer declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-registration or in his annual sales tax declaration.
The Ust Id number consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer runs a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the cancellation of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated at this time.
According to the Turnover Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax-payers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting turnover tax did not exceed the amount of 17,500 €and 2. Will probably not exceed the amount of 50,000 €in the following year.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay a turnover tax, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and submit an annual turnover tax return.
A small business owner can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the VAT and deduct the VAT.
Non-residents can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that you only make tax-free sales and waive the deduction of VAT.
The fiscal representative meets the tax requirements of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices state that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold specified in the Turnover Tax Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences can occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax collector receives a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for domestic sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he has to apply specifically for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both nkú and BRH noted that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which provides a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the tax payer does not register his business with the municipality or the relevant Fa.
This retroactive registration allows a true tax assessment for previous tax periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole of the EC should be harmonised.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for taxes to every natural person after birth.
This number is valid for life for natural persons resident in Germany.
If a natural person starts a business, the responsible company applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT identification number.
In the future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a tax payer and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law no. 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, passenger transport between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT applies even if the transport is carried out by persons registered as tax evaders in other Member States or by foreigners who are tax evaders at home.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than cross-border passenger transport by bus, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as a tax payer.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, chapter 5 (1) (b).
"for the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the directive is met or until the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is tax-exempt in Germany.
Nor does German taxation distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident tax-resident transports a person through Germany, the portion of the transport due to Germany is considered a tax-deductible transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the relevant company.
It registers it for tax purposes (Compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus named in the tax payer's application.
The entrepreneur must state his tax-deductible transport services in a German VAT return.
As of March 1, 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd company.
If the transport service is provided for a domestic entrepreneur, the non-resident tax payer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the company.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services must pay the VAT to the Tax Office and the net amount charged to the non-resident tax resident, which is referred to as the "transfer of the tax liability" and is in accordance with article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax resident and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means to verify the accuracy of the tax return with regard to tax-related passenger transport:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the relevant Fa.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can ask the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing the journey.
The non-resident tax payer can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the Fa, or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign tax payer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA can request assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to check the VAT return or the compliance with the tax law by a non-resident bus operator to be too expensive in relation to the small amount of VAT on tax-exempt passenger transport.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident tax resident causes disproportionately high costs for the tax resident himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination will require a higher amount of time than a resident tax resident, although the examination will be limited to the passenger transport carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident tax resident must not only accept the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States where he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the tax payer must comply with all existing tax law requirements in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
The correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport thus leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States as well as between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the route covered by the German state.
If a non-resident tax payer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must first notify the relevant Fa.
This registers the tax payer who has to declare the tax-deductible portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
The law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax evacuees registered with the Chemnitz-Süd Company have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The amount of tax in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the service provider is located.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales Tax Returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise stipulated by the law, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit a VAT return within 25 days of the end of the tax period, even if no tax liability has been incurred, on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The tax liability arises at the end of the period for the delivery of the VAT return. The VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation according to Law No. 235 / 2004. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
If, as a result, there is a claim for reimbursement of above-average deductible taxes, this amount will be refunded to the tax payer within 30 days of setting this deduction, without having to make an application for it.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the financial Officer Starts a Tax Procedure regarding the tax liability of the tax payer.
Pursuant to section 73 (11) of Law no. 235 / 2004, the right to deduct VAT may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct VAT arose.
At the end of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been asserted for the first time.
A tax collector must issue a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax liability, but only change the previous information, c) He makes corrections of the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with Section 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax collector can issue a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The tax payer must make the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
The sales tax return can be issued electronically either via the Internet or by means of a data carrier.
The submission via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be filed on data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for specifying the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the sales tax return.
Some categories are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered as tax evaders is compared with the data provided by Czech tax evaders in their summary reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered as tax residents is compared with the information in the summary reports of tax payers from other EC Member States with the help of the MIA.
Under the ATIS system, the credibility of the VAT returns will be checked by the FA.
This is done automatically, as the sales tax return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law no. 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated Tax Information System - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
The ncú found during its audit that FÄ rarely made use of the possibility to impose a fine on the tax payer in case of non-delivery of the VAT return.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.
Those tax payers who are obliged to file VAT pre-registrations must nevertheless file an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners, who are not obliged to pay the sales tax, must make an annual sales tax return.
Tax payers are, in principle, obliged to file a VAT advance notification by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the turnover tax is generated (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the sales tax liability in the previous year was more than €6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to file monthly sales tax advance registrations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The tax payer may also opt to file monthly VAT pre-registration if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (Section 18 (2a) of the VAT Act).
If the annual turnover tax is not more than 512 €, neither VAT pre-registration nor VAT returns are to be made.
The resulting VAT liability is to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(legal) there are no deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German Sales Tax Act allows an extension of these (delivery or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the time limit must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period of December.
If an error is detected, the entrepreneur must file a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the sales tax return submitted to the Tax Office by 31 May of the following year has been submitted, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect sales tax advance notification, but only the incorrect annual sales tax return.
Corrections of this VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the tax payer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was issued.
At the end of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of frivolous tax cuts or tax evasion.
Tax payers are required to file VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unfavorable hardships.
The annual sales tax return can be issued either on paper or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the tax payer must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT pre-registrations or declarations are made, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover generated by the tax payer.
In the event of a late Levy, the tax payer may be charged a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
During an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not charge this late surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ charged the late payment, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The late surcharge therefore misses its purpose to reduce the average delay, particularly in the submission of the annual sales tax return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines of information on the value of intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be indicated in a separate line of the sales tax return.
The sales tax returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by dedicated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
After which all data is recorded electronically, they are subject to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain criteria.
The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible person on the basis of the automatically created Audit notes (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the tax payer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, tax payers have to file their advance registrations at the latest 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.
The annual sales tax declaration must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The right to submit an annual sales tax return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ after the end of the calendar year, the tax payer can correct the errors in the monthly advance registrations by submitting a single VAT return;
- If the tax payer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- the federal states only compare MIAs data on intra-Community purchases of German tax evaders when the annual sales tax declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy will enable the German Financial Administration to verify compliance with the turnover limit for small business owners.
In addition, the competent company can align the annual sales tax declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only verify the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax payers are obliged to submit their VAT registration electronically.
The introduction of the right to electronic tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech Financial Administration.
Summary messages
Submission and processing of summaries in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law no. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, according to the Ust-idnr7, the individual tax payers under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The tax payers with a calendar-monthly or quarterly tax period have to hand over the ZM to the local company at the latest on the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the finding of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, tax payers can also hand over the ZM electronically.
If a tax collector does not issue a ZM or correction ZM, although he is required to do so under Law No. 235 / 2004, the Financial Officer must ask him to surrender the ZM in question, pointing out the consequences of the non-Levy. In the event of non-monetary compliance, the Financial Officer is authorized to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million, in accordance with section 37 of Law no. 337 / 1992.
The ncú found during its audit that the FÄ mostly did not use its authority to impose fines on its defaulting tax payers.
In particular, the tax payers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations when handing over the ZM, as the failure to levy a Zm does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
In accordance with Section 102 (5) of Law no. 235 / 2004, the Financial Officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or the amendment, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 The information in the ZM with which the tax payer rectifies false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on its own initiative or on request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the tax payer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction-ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction-ZM,
- The financial officer has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the tax payer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Corrections made by the financial officer, without a correction fee from the tax payer, do not replace the tax worker's right to make a correction, but only lead to the correction of the data in the balance sheet, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM will be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the clo (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department of International Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance), and the "o _ mctl" message is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect UST IDNr., which were indicated in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect USt Id number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry in the list of the incorrect USt Id number is made.
The list contains a "notification of doubt regarding USt-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the tax payer must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return specified for this purpose.
The CLO will forward selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech tax payer in its VAT return and the values indicated by the supplier from the other Member State in its ZM for the delivery of goods to the relevant company for examination.
The experts there have to investigate the deviations.
There may then be three different situations:
A) the value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant sections of its VAT return is lower than the value of supplies indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can result either from a change of the information within the EC (the foreign supplier rectifies his ZM) or from a change of the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax payer, meanwhile, makes a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the Financial Officer's discretion to verify the accuracy of the information in the sales tax return.
(C) the value of goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech tax payer in his VAT return, is higher than the value of their goods delivered by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, it is up to the Financial Officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer enters the results of his review into Atis.
These results will be sent to the CLO.
For each quarter of 2005, the number of transactions sent by the CLO for examination can be seen in Graph no. 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the clo to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech clo has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for requests for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on a fault of the domestic buyer.
There may also be an error on the part of the tax payer in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies are given differently in the ZM in the different EC Member States.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the audited FÄ are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summaries in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC member states or take part in triangular transactions must hand over ZM quarterly, in which intra-Community deliveries are listed by acquirer (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of VAT pre-registrations, this also applies to the Zm.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been compulsory.
The competent FA can allow exemptions for individual tax-resistant measures in order to avoid unfavorable hardships.
If the tax payer finds that the ZM was defective, he is obliged to submit a correction ZM within one month.
In the event of a non-submission of the ZM, the CLO will initiate a coercive procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, linked to the threat of a penalty payment and - fixing the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows the imposition of a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets a three-stage penalty payment of €125, €250 and €500.
In addition, section 26a (1) No. 5 of the UStG stipulates that the tax payer acts in breach of the law if he intentionally or recklessly fails to deliver a Zm correctly, not completely or in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This infringement can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS BY THE FÄ, because only the CLO is responsible for the processing of the Zm.
The data of the ZM is stored only with the CLO.
The information from the summary reports is only available to the FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
ZM data must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID number in the ZM of German tax evaders, the German clo will receive a notification "o _ mctl" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant Fa.
It is then his job to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the Ust Id number at the request of the CLO.
However, remembering, threatening and fixing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time when a tax payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were finally reported to the competent authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.
The relevant company refused to grant tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these forces9.
If the tax collector provided the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the levy of the corrected ZM.
As the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information on goods deliveries in the VAT pre-registration or the VAT return with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is transmitted to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT identification numbers are identified and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of the income tax in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data of previous Calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), Control Notices will be issued and sent to the competent authorities.
This happens on an ongoing basis, whereas the acquisition data of all tax payers is later compiled and forwarded to the FÄ.
The Risk Management System (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares this data with those for intra-Community purchases.
The system verifies in full (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must hand over a ZM to the local company within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by tax payers in the CME are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the same tax payers in their VAT returns.
The results of the settlement will be taken into account in the tax assessment.
In Germany, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are obligated to pay quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter 10.
Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have had to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM will only be available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, tax payers in the ZM only specify the supply of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the ZM issued.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAs data, incorrect USt Id numbers were not corrected, even if the tax payer communicated the correct USt Id number to the Fa.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German tax evaders in their VAT pre-registrations with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German clo forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
The data provided by other Member States on the supply of goods to Czech tax payers is compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchase of goods specified by Czech tax payers in their VAT returns.
The Czech clo performs the adjustment for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations will be sent to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech Financial Administration, the German Financial Administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control will only be carried out for tax evaders who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community purchases of other tax evaders if the RMS produces an audit note or the tax evader has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves FÄ from clarifying the reasons for differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
To combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAs, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax-payers had to hand over monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, since most tax-payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-registrations, and ZM does not require more information than for VAT returns or pre-registrations.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be linked to the submission of the VAT returns or pre-registrations.
However, a monthly levy on ZM would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community purchases and increase the flow of data between CLO.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed because of the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAs data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the commitment to the monthly levy of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of the intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT Id numbers in the O _ mctl reports exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter audited.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ mctl messages.
While the Czech clo refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German clo refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ mctl was reported.
International exchange of information at Level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax evaders who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on Mutual Assistance in the field of Value Added Tax, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information (RFI) using the standard SCAC form.
Financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to a preserved RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO, which ensures that the information provided in the standard SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and forwarded to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and answers to requests sent. It ensures their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent authorities for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFI exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period under review were examined by the ncú.
Out of the total of 94 RFI received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the ncú had examined it. More detailed information on the time limits within which the Czech Republic responded to the requests made by Germany can be found in Graph 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) a reply was received within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases no reply was received from Germany at the time of the ncú's examination (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine when Germany received the information). Has answered searches).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Graph no. 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community sales indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Chart no. 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information, without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected by the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
"automatic exchange" under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals, without prior request.
"structured Automatic Exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously established information to another Member State without its prior request, once the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The financial officer receives this information from the pre-printed notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law no. 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
In processing this form, the Financial Officer will enter the required data in the relevant document and forward it directly to the relevant Financial Directorate employee, where the data will be collected and sent to the CLO for further processing, after which it will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on mail-order transactions tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community transactions that appear to be illegal and potential "missing traders."
This information will be sent to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information emanates from the local Fa.
The FÄ will send the completed SCAC 2004 form by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which will forward the scacforms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the scacforeprint used is unique.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were submitted in order to ensure the income tax in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community deliveries from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German clo receives a request for information from another Member State, it will examine whether the value of the supplies specified in the request exceeds the minimum threshold of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German clo refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum threshold.
In addition, the German clo provides for the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are not written in German or English.
In order to answer the request for information, the CLO directs it to the relevant Fa and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German clo has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ of answering the uncompleted requests for information.
The FÄ will receive the required information by writing to the tax payer or conducting an external audit.
External auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the VAT special audit, which covers all tax-related transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
With this short and flexible form of Audit, an announcement to the tax payer is not required and it has proved its worth in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the automatic exchange of information, Germany will provide the other Member State with the following information: - on VAT identification number allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of the VAT to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has decided to provide the other Member States with the following information as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The supply of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT, B. distance selling (mail order) to other EC Member States not subject to VAT in Germany, C. significant deviations between the purchases reported by a tax payer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods subject to taxation by the tax payer in Germany, E. potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as for tax evaders who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have misused a VAT ID number.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities, who send the corresponding scacforms to the CLO.
While the Czech clo uses bilingual scacforms (Czech-English) and translates information given into English or German, the Germans follow the instructions to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German clo does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the ncú found that the Czech Financial Administration completed 74.5% of requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information sent to Germany were handled by the German financial administration only in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German clo refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of reminders, a high proportion of frozen requests for information are made.
That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German clo is now reminding the tax authorities to respond to the pending requests for information.
VAT Risk Management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of the financial administration are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and economic management of VAT, or its risk management unit, deals with the identification of potential areas of risk for tax revenue and evaluates trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, the agency coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasions in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risk-bearing goods, conceptually prepares risk management in the area of sales tax and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Mutual Assistance in the area of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system of other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

Among other things, the tax audit and tax investigation methodology department conducts risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of financial directorates regarding the selection of cases to be examined, produces risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigators are in charge of the financial services. Their tasks include searching for tax evaders and industries that are at risk in terms of the prevalence of tax evasion (e.g. Internet shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searching for unregistered tax evacuees (e.g. Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), investigating cases of chain fraud and providing information to local financial authorities..
Special audit units have been set up in 12 selected FÄ.
They have a regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in established new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax evaders with specific activities, multinational companies and tax evaders with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - The task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-bearing nature of tax returns; - the task of "selecting tax beneficiaries to be examined," Selecting tax evaders to be examined on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAs" to provide tax officials with access to data provided by other EC Member States made possible.
The "MIAs" task allows, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of tax payers from other Member States, - Confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax payer, as stated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax payer in question from other Member States, - establishment of a list of tax payers who have not submitted ZM, - formal control of the information provided by tax payers in the Czech Republic, before sending this information to other Member States, to draw up a list of tax payers whose VAT returns do not match the information on goods delivered to other Member States with the information in the ZM, to draw up a list of tax payers whose VAT returns do not match the information on the value of goods purchased from other Member States with the information in the ZM of all their suppliers from other Member States 13.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, financial officials have access to data from state agencies such as commercial registers, land registry, motor vehicle registers, commercial registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 submission and processing of summaries in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial authorities of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an rms in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint Development Working Groups, neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the federal states have a complete set of data.
At the CLO level, the ST i 2 Unit (hereinafter "kiss" - Coordination Unit for Special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects the findings of the audit on fraud in the Opus database.
In cooperation with the countries, the Kiss has set up another database called magic, where the tax authorities can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters.
The Kiss coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at the national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KISS are brought into the development of the RMS by their cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStID no. Other Member States, which appear in the ZM of German tax authorities, is carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the UST identification number referred to in the ZM is assessed on the basis of the O _ mctl identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure of rectification of invalid UST identification number, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on MIAs data transmitted by other Member States and generates various types of communications to detect suspected missing traders, using certain characteristics that usually occur in carousel transactions.
The authorities of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to report the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH's audit has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different points of reference in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other factors, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the industry or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists with the tax authorities of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of tax payers who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete submission of the Zm.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the tax payer in its annual sales tax return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The tax administrations of the Federal States avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, because it would result in too many discrepancies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- suppliers and purchasers assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community sales;
- different accounting records and tax returns of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the information from the sales tax returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the sales tax returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, Age of the owners / partners, number of employees and payment method of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a rules-based risk management system that allows a team of tax fraud specialists ("risk managers") to program their own rules to identify suspected tax fraudsters.
This system is used in the processing of VAT pre-registrations by FÄ.
This will give the relevant Fa the advice of the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adapt the rules according to feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected backups.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system creates a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the tax evaders in question.
After the audit, the auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it has proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other evidence, this Neuro-fuzzy system (also known as datamining) calculates how likely it is that a tax payer is entangled in tax fraud.
It then creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ will select the relevant tax payers for consideration and report the audit results to the data centre in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems to be a good idea.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will materialise during actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the ncú and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German states mentioned above, the RMS of each European State has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - particularly carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national problem, but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC member state. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by pan-European VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why a European exchange of experience on the RMS should take place.
The nkú and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected Deliveries and / or deliveries, selected results from the examination of individual sales within the framework of the parallel tests.
Purchases which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial authorities of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, the implementation of which was in doubt, or which the tax authorities of both states stated differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, nkú examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax evaders.
In addition, in 43 cases, the ncú examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, as indicated by Czech tax evaders in their tax returns and ZM, on the basis of communications from the BRH.
At the request of the ncú, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax evaders.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector purchased goods worth €60,500 From a German tax resident.
When the Czech Tax Collector declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech Financial Administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German tax payer in question stated that in the second quarter of 2004 the Czech business partner had delivered goods worth €27,381, in the third quarter goods worth €31,997 and in the fourth quarter goods worth €10,276.
In addition, it emerged from the reply that the VAT ID number of the German tax payer was not valid until 28 September 2004. However, the German clo had accepted another application from the German tax payer and moved forward the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax authority corrected the Zm.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax payer.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the ncú found that in 2004 the Czech tax resident had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-YEAR) tax periods during which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time requested the deduction of VAT from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible officer of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the nkú, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as a tax payer in September 2003.
At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number that was valid exclusively for Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to assign a tax payer a VAT ID number retroactively, in 2006 the responsible person in charge of the German Financial Administration did so retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German clo grants a VAT ID number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the application of the tax payer to issue a VAT ID number.
In this case, the CLO issues the VAT ID number retroactively, because the contractor does not need a valid VAT ID number for an intra-Community delivery according to § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of its supplier to explain the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German clo issued the Ust Id number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for the review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
According to the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
The German authorities said in their reply that the German tax payer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but had not been allocated a VAT ID number in Germany for organisational reasons until 16 February 2005.
The nkú learned from a request from the local Czech tax official that the tax official had conducted a VAT audit for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During the audit, the Tax Office found that the Czech tax collector had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German tax collector before his VAT registration (i.e. before October 1, 2004).
The (Czech) Tax Office imposed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 on the Czech tax payer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the ncú's request, the BRH found that the German tax payer had not been assigned the Ust Id number until he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the filing of the sales tax return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the tax-exempt intra-Community acquisition from the Czech Republic, worth 160 €(approx. 5,000 CZK), stated.
3. In its sales tax return for September 2004 and in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax-deductible supply of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax payer stated.
When reviewing the registration of the German tax payer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official noted that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods were delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax collector issued a supplementary VAT return stating sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
In a request to the local Fa in the Czech Republic, the nkú found that the Czech tax resident subsequently filed a request for the resumption of the Tax Procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, it submitted a confirmation from the German Tax Administration that the German tax resident had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax payer in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to the German information, the German tax payer was not assigned a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to reopen the Tax Procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German tax payer had not received a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004.
However, the German Receiver explained both the acquisition and the intra-Community acquisition as well as the sales tax, and also demanded the reimbursement of taxes at the same level.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German tax payer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
In addition, the BRH found that the company of the German tax payer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the Answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax payers.
This change in the name of the German tax collector also confused the Czech Financial official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax resident of a German tax resident worth €22,686.
In a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the ncú found that the Czech tax official had examined in the course of an external audit with the Czech Tax Collector whether the intra-Community supply had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax payer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech Tax Collector did not explain the acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax payer will not be registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community sales until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax payer.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German Tax Administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax resident so that he could initiate a tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a turnover tax for the acquisition of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a tax collector who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the VAT number of the acquirer in the other Member State and must be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, under German tax law, turnover is A (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery that should be subject to employment taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech Financial Officer took note of this business incident because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German clo rejects requests for information on intra-Community sales if they are below the minimum threshold of €15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax collector acquired goods worth 12,561 €From a German tax resident.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
Within the framework of the intergovernmental assistance, the Czech Financial Administration asked for the examination of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech tax collector said that he had not received the goods, that he had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been booked with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documents for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax determination was in place.
Following a request from the ncú, the BRH found that the German tax collector acted as "fiscal representative 17" (§ 22 (A) - (e) UStG).
The German tax authority explained these deliveries in its sales tax return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the BRH notification, the German FA will send to the Czech Republic the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods.
In Section 4.6.1 it was shown that the answers of the German Financial Administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the answers of the Czech Financial Administration:
6. During its audit, the ncú found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech Financial administration submitted a request for information on the value of deliveries to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax payer reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax payer worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax payer declared in his VAT return only the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed, since the German company was dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech Tax Administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, worth €1,265,554, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The ncú found that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request to the local financial officer, the nkú found that the Czech tax collector had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new vehicles to these German tax payers, valued at CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax collector issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German clo did not pass on this request for information to the local Fa for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out by the German acquirer in Germany, which found that the purchase of all motor vehicles in question had been correctly taxed, and that the vehicles were sold to other tax payers in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech tax collector acquired a car worth €48,500 From a German tax collector.
However, the Czech Tax Collector did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
Through a request from the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the ncú found that the Czech tax collector had not issued a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech Tax Collector did not issue any tax returns, even at the request of the Financial Officer. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA determined the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 with zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an order to examine the said delivery from the German tax payer.
Since the Czech tax clerk did not cooperate with the financial officer, he made a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the ncú audit how the Czech Financial official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the provisions of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax resident has been deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only one partial word was sent because, at the time of the ncú and BRH examination, the relevant Fa had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech Financial official asked, using a SCAC form, for a review of a delivery of motor vehicles in the third quarter of 2004 to a German tax payer worth 16,991 €, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his response to the request for information, the German tax official said that he had only received invoices issued by the Czech Tax Authorities for deliveries worth 16,335 €.
On the basis of the ncú's request, the BRH found that the external examination carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth 16,335 €double in its VAT Pre-Registration for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using a SCAC form, asked for a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with signs of carousel fraud.
The German Financial Administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax payer had acquired several motor vehicles, and that the investigation in Germany has not yet been completed.
The ncú found that the local Fa had conducted several external audits of the Czech tax resident to verify the deduction of above-average high taxes.
However, an unauthorised claim has not been established.
The BRH found that, for the period in question, the German tax authority had declared in its VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States for a total value of €579,114, and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
In Section 4.4.1, the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions are described in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic discrepancies or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAs, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech tax collector acquired goods worth €35,716 from the German tax collector, but the Czech Tax Collector did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech tax clerk did not cooperate with the tax clerk and did not do business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax clerk asked for a review of how the German tax clerk had communicated with the Czech as part of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German Financial Administration, the Czech tax payer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German Tax Collector only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech Tax Collector sent the German tax collector a false confirmation of payment of €155,153 in favour of the German tax payer.
After discovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech buyer, the German tax collector, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the supplied material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
In a request to the local company in the Czech Republic, the ncú found that the tax administration, based on the information received from the Czech tax payer, subsequently applied the vat of goods from other Member States in the amount of 388,522 CZK.
Following a request from the ncú, the BRH confirmed that after corrections the German supplier had only notified a shipment of goods to the Czech tax payer worth 7,916 €.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authority declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
Its ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech Tax Authorities:
12.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German Financial Administration asked for the review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a scacprintout.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax resident had supplied the German tax resident with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.
The ncú found that the Czech Financial Administration had carried out an audit with the Czech tax collector to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech Financial Administration said that the Czech tax collector had supplied and installed a production plant for the German.
The Czech tax collector supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was installed on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax collector did not accept the installed production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax payer charged the German with the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax collector received the Rech-rations, but did not acknowledge them and did not pay them either.
Through a request from the local financial officer in the Czech Republic, the ncú found that all invoices in the books of the Czech tax collector had been properly booked.
The sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech tax payer and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH found that, based on the response of the Czech Financial Administration, the local Fa concluded that these revenues were a uniform (goods) Delivery of the Czech tax payer to the Germans, including the assembly performed.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is installed.
The German recipient of the work delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German Sales Tax Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction in the same amount.
As the turnover tax liability of the German tax payer remained unchanged, the German FA did not make a correction to the turnover tax return.
13. According to the MIAS data, in February 2005, the Czech Tax Firm a acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax firm C.
The Czech Financial official asked Germany to review this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax authority C had delivered this machine to the Czech Tax Authority B in 2004, but that it had returned it to the German tax authority C in October 2004.
According to the German Financial Administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax subsidiary C in the Czech Republic.
In response to the request for information, it also emerged that the German tax firm C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax firm A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German tax administrator's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no internal delivery of goods.
Through a request from the local tax officer, the nkú found that, according to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, the German tax authority C supplied the Czech tax-exempt goods (another machine) worth €88,027.
The tax collector B said that he did not receive the goods, so that the local Czech financial officer made a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations of the tax payer B, the Financial Officer stated that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been registered with the tax payer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German tax payer c delivered to the Czech tax payer a in February 2005.
The ncú also found that the Czech Financial Officer responsible for the tax resident had carried out an audit on the latter.
The financial officer had the invoice of the German tax employee C of 7 February 2005, in which the tax employee A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official found that tax payer a had not booked this bill.
Tax resident a had concluded a lease with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
Leasingﬁrma delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the tax payer A.
The BRH found that the German tax firm C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic but to another German tax firm d.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-exempt delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the claim of the German tax resident c to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German operator D delivered the machine to the Czech operator B.
Under German law, this delivery was not tax-deductible in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that the German tax firm C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 that a machine worth €58,000 had been delivered to the Czech Tax Firm A.
This delivery was not verified during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The following figure shows the contractual relations between the business partners involved in the above mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the ncú found that on 4 October 2005, the Czech Financial Administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German financial official asked for the review of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German finance official said that there was a suspicion that this was a fictional intra-Community supply of goods.
The German tax authority has not carried out any active business since 1999.
The ncú found that the Czech Financial official had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax collector.
The head of the Czech company said that this was probably a claim made by the German tax payer to the German Financial Administration, which the Czech tax payer claimed as a shareholder in the German company to the German company.
According to the information given to the ncú, the Czech Financial official has so far no information that the German financial administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax payer.
It is clear from the information available that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as as intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax payer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax resident delivered a total value of 33,205 €to a Czech tax resident.
However, the Czech Tax Collector did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech Financial official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In response to this request for information, the German side said that the German tax collector had sent some of the goods to the address of the Czech tax collector, and that he had personally picked up the remaining goods.
By means of a request from the local Czech fi- Nanz official, the nkú found that the Czech tax collector had issued a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit with the Czech tax collector.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a German tax collector delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax resident.
For the same period, a Czech tax collector declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech Financial official asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.
The German response to this request sent three invoices, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount equal to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax payer and the MIAS data.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the nkú found that after receiving the reply from Germany, the nkú approached the accountant of the Czech tax payer and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about issuing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary VAT return has been issued.
The Czech tax official told the ncú that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT determination for the relevant tax period would be met.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax resident delivered €11,600 worth of goods to the German tax resident.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial official asked for an examination of whether the aforementioned Czech tax evaders actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax evader had founded a number of bogus stocks in Germany.
In the course of the company's review of the transaction, the Czech Tax Authority confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax payer, however, the goods were not delivered to the Czech Republic by Germany, but sold on in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax collector presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax payer was not registered as a tax payer in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official sent this information to the German tax administration in his response to the request for information.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the ncú found that the Czech tax collector had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax collector and at the same time asserted the right of the pre-tax deduction for the acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech sales tax return, he did not report any sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return issued after the external audit, the Czech tax official determined the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported to the Czech Republic from another Member State.
Thus, the Czech Financial official drew the wrong conclusion in the external audit.
The BRH found that the German tax official immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the tax return of the German tax payer and demanded the payment of VAT worth 1,600 €.
In addition, the relevant Fa sent a control notice to the FA, which is responsible for the actual recipient of the goods, to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries, which may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German Tax Administration on whether the Czech tax payer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax payer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by a copy of the VAT registration certificate issued by the Czech tax payer.
A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was attached as a further attachment.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech Financial official found that the passport was stolen, that the person named in it had not brought a vehicle into the Czech Republic and said that he had no contact with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the copy of which was sent by the German side, was not issued by the Czech Financial Administration.
With this information, the Czech Financial Officer answered the request for information and said at the same time that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
In a request to the local Czech financial officer, the nkú found that the Czech tax collector does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the Commercial Register and that the company's managing director is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period of February 2005, the Czech tax official determined the tax liability of the Czech tax payer with zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial officer had rejected the claim of the German tax payer to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German company was not able to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods indicated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech tax collector should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax collector.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax payer was not in line with the MIAS data, the German tax official asked for the verification of deliveries and their payment within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech Financial official said that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was probably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax collector issued a sales tax return and a ZM, which was signed after the CEO was removed from the commercial register by a person not authorized to do so, namely this shareholder of the company.
The accountant of the Czech tax payer told the Financial Officer that the owner of the capital had paid the payment received for the goods in euros into the company's account.
Receipts have not been issued.
In a request to the local Czech company, the ncú found that the financial officer had accepted the claim of the Czech tax payer for VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States, valued at CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the sales tax return of the German acquirer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax payer.
Since the previous external audit did not show any signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to charge a fixed VAT debt.
20. According to Mias data, in 2005, a German tax collector purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196, after which he purchased goods worth €43,274 the previous year.
The German tax authority did not explain the intra-Community acquisitions in its 2004 sales tax return or in the 2005.
In addition, he did not declare any value-related initial sales.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax payer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech Financial Administration said that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
The documents provided to the ncú by the responsible financial officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech Tax Office, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.
At the same time, the tax collector was asked by the tax official to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but he did not do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech tax collector has not issued any sales tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the ncú, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the Responsible Company (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do tax-related business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but did not receive a German USt-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UdK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax payer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- the Danish company (UdK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UdK) and the latter had the transport carried out on its own behalf, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC member state (AU) and the recipient is registered as a tax resident in an EC member state (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC member state for which the delivery was intended is different from the state of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) made the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- the delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- the delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) delivered both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The ncú found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community purchases in Austria, cooperation between at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the ncú and the BRH examined case designs to show the extent of differences between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data caused by the different Laws of 2004.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the tax payers and the tax authorities to apply the new legal regulations:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax-exempt supply of goods with a total value of 792,977,452 CZK was reported to a German tax payer.
In the same period, another Czech tax collector reported in his ZM intra-Community deliveries to another German tax collector in the total value of 18,157,265 CZK.
From the information provided by the BRH TO THE nkú, it emerged that both were electricity supplies.
Both Czech tax payers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
During a further examination of these transactions, an nkú Audit Group found that in 2004, different legal regulations governing the supply and purchase of electrical energy were in force between the Czech Republic and Germany.
While in the Czech Republic, tax payers declared the supply of electrical energy as intra-Community goods, in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legislation in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and tax-free sales in Germany.
The differences in the legal regulations were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of the Law no. 635 / 2004, which changed some tax regulations with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax collector in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 intra-Community deliveries to a German tax payer for a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax collector in his ZM for the same period intra-Community deliveries to another German tax resident for a value of CZK 263,470.776 CZK declared.
Information provided by the BRH TO THE nkú showed that both were electric energy supplies.
According to the wording of Act No. 235 / 2004, which applies from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place of performance where the acquirer has his legal domicile, his place of business or his place of business for which the supply is made.
Therefore, the Czech tax authorities were not allowed to specify the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both tax payers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies resulted in a difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAs.
Final comment
The cooperation achieved the objectives of the BRH AND THE nkú.
Both courts of auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing the VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions were revealed.
Some of them are worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both audit offices drew up recommendations for the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the further observation.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation between the two courts of auditors is the basis for the successful execution of future audits in the area of turnover tax administration.
