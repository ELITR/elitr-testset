Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the Court of Auditors have the power to audit the entire public finances.
The statement requires the Court of Auditors to have the power to scrutinise tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of Europe's Top Audit Authorities (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national auditors carry out their audit activities only in cooperation with the auditors of other countries. to be able to.
As an example, the examination of internationally organized fraud may be considered, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed to combat such offences.
Auditors who scrutinise this area must be prepared to work closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of VAT as well as the MIAS system was born at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating Court of Auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the analysis of the available information, we made the selection of the examination subject-matter for the audit planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT, and Creating greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Case number: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Examining subject:
(CZ) Management of VAT after Czech Republic joins the European Union
(DE) Audit on the cooperation of administrative authorities in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
The Commission's audit target:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures used by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (' EC '). ) with free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.
(DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on administrative assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above regulations.
As a result of the audit, vulnerabilities should be identified and recommendations should be made to address them.
VAT information exchange system The audits were jointly carried out by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKcomo") and the Federal Court of Justice ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany as a result of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006. Performed.
The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of international administrative assistance between the financial administrations. Information and comparison of VAT management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the examinations was prepared in line with European Guideline 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The period audited covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audit
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two Court yards.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary summaries. Messages.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by bus and bus and coach comparisons.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for sales tax purposes.
While in Germany the entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is the exceeding of the revenue threshold set out in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community sales.
In Germany, the taxpayer receives a tax number valid only for domestic sales for the purposes of sales tax.
If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the issuance of a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be standardised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is tax-free, but there is a right to deduct input tax.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Directive 2006/112/EC of the Council of 28 November 2006 on the Common VAT System (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic taxpayers only have to file VAT returns for underyear tax periods (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany (monthly or quarterly) have
Sales tax pre-registrations and a sales tax declaration after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany have to submit the VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic are required to submit their summary reports to the tax offices (FIS), German taxpayers must submit the summary reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary reports is available to the FIS in the Czech Republic immediately after they have been submitted.
The information from the summary reports is only available after they have been processed by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community sales is needed as promptly as possible.
The monthly submission of summary messages would shorten the period between the time of sales and the updating of MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the buyer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
In the case of requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the specified time limit.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended constant monitoring of deadlines for the German CLO (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKcomo and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
As part of the cooperation, the two Court of Auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed by using the legal options of the CLO, where there were doubts about the correct taxation or suspicions of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FIS used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxpayers concerned.
In those cases, taxpayers had either unlawfully taken advantage of the VAT exemption or had not reported the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FIS could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial management of another Member State refused to provide information requested.
Some cases have been uncovered where taxpayers misreported sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in MIAS were therefore incorrect, requiring the caseworkers (the FIS) to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II – "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Departments Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.

The College of the NKcomo approved the exam findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedure in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the audit area for traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKcomo, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and CLO, the audit was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.

The results of the examination were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings were held by representatives of both Court of Auditors.
Participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the financial administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of VAT management in each other's countries.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At that meeting, a timetable for further proceedings was drawn up and the following examination topics were identified for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of taxpayers.
2nd.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach – legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of financial officials in dealing with requests for information and reviewing selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5th.
Summary messages.
6th.
Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the sales tax sector.
At a meeting to coordinate further examination of the NKkok and BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel audits already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal headquarters, registered office or an establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of 1.000.000 CZK is arrested on the first day of the third month after the month in which In which he has crossed the threshold, subject to payment (§ 94 (1) of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., concerning sales tax; "Law No. 235/2004" below).
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which they have exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow a taxpayer to register retroactively if they have exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal headquarters, registered office or a company in the Czech Republic who provides VAT benefits or benefits exempt from VAT with the right to deduct input tax must also apply to VAT Then register if its turnover does not exceed 1 million CZK, but it meets other requirements set out in Law No. 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal headquarters, place of business or an establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure under Law No. 337/1992 begins with the receipt of the registration application by the local finance officer.
If you wish to register voluntarily for VAT, you must specify in your application the cut-off date on which you apply for registration as a VAT payer.
The financial officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts as to the information provided therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the finance officer has determined by review that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written opinion on the registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the finance officer must indicate the effective date of registration for VAT and the investment period for sales tax.
The investment period is the calendar quarter; Unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least 10.000.000 CZK.
If this is the case, the investment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least 2.000.000 CZK in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the investment period and must inform the financial officer of this change.
The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive in nature.
The taxpayer must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the financial officer, in addition, in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235/2004, concerning the elimination of tax Documates s)3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as a special law determines this. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).
If, despite its request from the financial officer, the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation, the local tax officer must register him on his own initiative.
A communication will also be issued on this, which will be sent to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur approved for business will receive a tax number when they first register for any type of tax.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
Pursuant to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, the financial officer may, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register the sales tax, require that the taxpayer receive up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover attributable to the taxpayer Reliant unlawfully carried out without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxpayer, until the date on which registration as a taxpayer by the injunction of the financial officer (Section 98 (1) of Law 235/2004).
The payment of the amount set in this way is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
In the event of the legal requirements, the registration of a VAT payer can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
A taxpayer may request the cancellation of their registration at the earliest one year after the effective date referred to in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of registration on its own merits (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235/2004) if: (a) the taxpayer did not perform during 12 consecutive months and has not informed the financial officer of the reasons for (b) the taxpayer His obligations under Law No. 235/2004 has not been fulfilled, (c) the previous taxpayer no longer meets the requirements for the tax liability.
(B) Taxpayers without a legal seat, place of business or premises in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and in the Czech Republic neither their legal seat, registered office Has still a place of establishment or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235/2004 (" Non-resident entrepreneur ") becomes taxable with the provision of the service in question.
He must apply for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.
It is obliged, in this request, to include all VAT ID allotted to it in other Member States or third countries. Specify.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 must register him retrospectively, since he or she is entitled to law No. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable Service provision in the Czech Republic was subject to VAT.
In the event of retrospective registration, the FA must require Prague 1 to provide the entrepreneurs concerned with a document (invoices or written explanations) for proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, the FA must require Prague 1 to submit the performance documents.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235/2004, the financial officer has the power to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of January 31 of the following calendar year if the latter has the obligation to submit tax applications or – Statements and accepted for tax payment.
When examining the NKcomo, it emerged that in the event of a tax return being filed by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory cut-off date for the filing of a tax return, this declaration had not yet been made by the FA by 31 January. It has been received.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, an erasure of the non-resident entrepreneur's registration for VAT in the Czech Republic is No longer possible in the calendar year in question.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the Tax Regulations (§ § 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be registered with the municipality and/or the relevant tax office.
This application must be made no later than one month after commencement of business.
The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has started but has not been registered, it may also register taxpayers retrospectively on its own initiative.
In Germany, taxpayers, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for Zwekke of the sales tax if they meet the requirements in § 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special FIS are responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.
For example, the FA ChemnitzSouth is responsible for those entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic.
On 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with it; On 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the findings of the BRH, these FIS with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new central and central property. Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since, after the accession of these ten countries, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed persons tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (sham) self-employed persons do not meet the requirements set out in § 2 of the UStG for recognition as an entrepreneur, since they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working hours and the type of work execution.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the relevant FA and provide information about the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory pre-print for all FIS in Germany.
It is processed either in special organizational units within the FIS or in the organizational units generally responsible for the tax assessment.
This prepression is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the relevant FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, The following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxpayer, the last digit Is always a control figure.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a USt-IdNr in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The USt-IdNr. Automatically allocated by the CLO is when the taxpayer declares intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-registrations or in their annual sales tax declaration.
The USt-IdNr. Consist of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he ceases to do business), but only after processing all tax transactions (predisposition of all financial years) or 2. if the financial administration determines that he has no Business more operates.
As a rule, the validity of the USt-IdNr depends. The validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FIS must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number, so that the validity of the VAT ID number there. Can be terminated at this time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting sales tax did not exceed the amount of €17,500 and will be 2nd The following year probably does not exceed the amount of €50,000.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge other entrepreneurs sales tax, nor for the pretax deduction.
Although they don't have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the Tax Office and file an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner may declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the next five years.
He is then allowed to charge the sales tax and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for sales tax purposes.
The invoices indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceeding of the threshold amount mentioned in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer will receive a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community sales.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community sales, he must specifically allocate a USt-IdNr. to apply for.
Both the NKcomo and the BRH noted that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which has a single identification number for both national registration for VAT and Generating intra-Community sales can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows retrospective (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the relevant FA.
This retroactive registration allows for a correct predisposition to sales tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole of the EC should be standardised.
The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxes to every natural person after birth.
This number applies to individuals residing in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up business, the relevant FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which is known as VAT ID No. Serves.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the USt-IdNr. To give.
Work to implement an IT process for managing numbers is ongoing.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal requirements in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004, the transport of passengers between the individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and it exists since 1 May 2004. Entitlement to pre-tax deduction.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons registered as taxpayers in other Member States or by foreigners liable to tax domestically.
The return journey is considered a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not engage in any economic activity other than cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach, they are not obliged to act as subject to VAT in the Czech Republic To register.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic was excluded from VAT liability as a result of the Law on Accession of the Czech Republic Annex No. V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The listed body states in the wording:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with paragraph 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the requirement of the Article 28 (4) of the Directive is complied with or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States. "
The legal requirements in Germany
According to Article 46 of Directive 2006/112/EG of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the part of the transport service attributable to the country is subject to taxation in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxpayer promotes persons through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany is considered a taxable transport.
Before providing his services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the relevant FA.
This registers him for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and grants a special certificate for each bus of strength mentioned in the taxpayer's application.
The entrepreneur must state his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided to a domestically resident entrepreneur, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the sales tax to the FA himself.
In its place, the domestic buyer of the services must pay the sales tax to the tax office and the net amount charged to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is known as the "shift in tax liability" and is in line with Article 196 of Directive 2006/112/EC of the Council.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German financial administration has several means of examining the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable personal transport:
Customs mobile control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each audit, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the relevant FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the sales tax paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his sales tax return.
If the FA has doubts as to the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the FA or use the administrative assistance funds referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally fixed VAT, the FA may request administrative assistance under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or compliance with the tax liability by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the small amount of revenue from the sales tax on Taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the examination of a non-resident taxpayer's books incurs disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit is expected to result in a higher amount of time than for a resident taxpayer, although the audit is limited to the personal transport carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States insofar as he carries out personal promotions there.
In addition, for each Member State in which even a single person is transported, the taxpayer must have all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the relevant Member State. EC Member States.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation varies between the two countries.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between various EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Czech Republic's accession law.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the route of transport generated by German territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must register this with the relevant FA beforehand.
The taxpayer registers the taxpayer who has to declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with the FA Chemnitz-South have the transport of persons as their business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to administrative expenses.
Member States – levy VAT under Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EG of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system – have a high administrative burden relative to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state where promotion begins or where the care provider is based.
Such a form of taxation would call for an amendment to the Council's Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Delivery and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise determined by the law, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur is in charge of filing a VAT return on the requirement set by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period. Committed.
The tax liability arises at the expiry of the deadline for filing the VAT return. The exception to this scheme is, in accordance with Law No. 235/2004, the VAT on the import of goods. This is where the due date of the tax is determined by customs rules.
If, as a result, there is an above-average deductible input entitlement, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of this deduction being set, without any application being drawn up for it must.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the Treasury officer initiates a tax procedure regarding the taxpayer's tax liability.
Pursuant to Section 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the right to deduct input tax may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the entitlement to pre-tax deduction was created.
After this period, the deduction of input tax can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period in which the assertion would have been possible for the first time.
For this, however, a supplementary VAT return is required.
An amendment to Law No. 235/2004, which came into force on 1 January 2005, allows a supplementary VAT return to be made only for the period in which the entitlement to deductions for VAT could have been asserted for the first time.
A taxpayer must file a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the adjustments leads to an increase in the tax liability, (b) he makes adjustments which do not alter the recently known tax liability, but only previous ones Details are amended (c) he makes adjustments to the VAT rate and tax liability in accordance with Section 49 of Law No. 235/2004.
A taxpayer can file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the adjustments reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
The revenue tax return can be delivered electronically either via the Internet or via a medium.
Delivery via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to disks.
The preprint for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some sections are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States as taxable persons is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States registered as taxable persons is compared with the help of MIAS with the information in the summary reports of taxpayers from other EC Member States.
Under the ATIS system, the FA is subject to a credibility check of VAT returns.
This is done automatically because the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior audit.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No. 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who have their non-monetary obligations under this or any particular tax code or a decision under this Act. Not comply.
Automated tax information system – Automated Tax Information System, which the Czech tax authorities use to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its audit, the Commission found that the Commission rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxpayer concerned in the event of non-filing of the VAT return.
Delivery and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are required to submit VAT advance registrations will still have to submit an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not required to pay sales tax must file an annual sales tax return.
Taxpayers are generally obliged to submit a VAT pre-registration by the end of the calendar quarter in which the sales tax is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability is fraud in the previous year more than €6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The taxpayer can also opt for the filing of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has been reimbursed in the previous year for an amount of €6,136 (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual sales tax has not exceeded €512, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT returns must be issued.
A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund may result in a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) There are no deadlines for processing VAT returns and for refunding VAT overpayments.
In order to receive a timely refund, security can be offered for the refund amount.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows these (levy or payment) deadlines to be extended (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the delivery of the VAT pre-registrations as well as the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special prepayment must be made for this.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability found for the pre-registration period in December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the VAT return to be filed by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-registration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Adjustments of this VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.
After this four-year period expires, a sales tax return can usually only be corrected in cases of frivolous tax shortening or tax evasion.
Taxpayers must submit the VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The FIS may grant exceptions to this rule to avoid unreasonable hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the taxpayer must make the declaration on additional paper and with his personal signature.
If no pre-sales tax applications or declarations are submitted, the financial administration is entitled to provide a rough estimate of the revenue generated by the taxpayer.
In the event of a late levy, the taxpayer may be subject to a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to €25,000).
In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FIS often did not charge this delay.
In cases where the fee collected the delay surcharges, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose in reducing the average delay, particularly in the filing of the annual VAT return.
The pre-print of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-tax transactions must be reported in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially determined personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is collected electronically, they undergo a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the competent clerk on the basis of the automatically prepared inspection notices (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the taxpayer's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers must submit their advance applications no later than 10 days, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, either after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual VAT declaration must be made by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to file an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by filing a single VAT return;
– If the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
– The federal states do not match MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the VAT annual declarations have been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy obligation enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the revenue limit for small business owners.
In addition, the relevant FA may match the annual VAT statement with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only verify the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to file the VAT pre-registration.
The introduction of the obligation to file the tax return in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary messages
Delivery and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit relevant summary notifications (' ZM ').
The value of the delivered goods is always given in Czech currency in the ZM, broken down according to the USt-IdNr7, the individual taxpayer under whom they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxpayers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must surrender the ZM to the local FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the error being detected.
Faulty data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, taxpayers can also hand over ZM electronically.
If a taxpayer does not give up ZM or correction ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No. 235/2004, the Chief Financial Officer must invite him to surrender the ZM in question, referring to the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-performance of non-monetary obligations, the financial officer has the power to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992.
In its audit, the Commission found that the Commission mostly did not use its power to impose fines on its defaulting taxpayers.
In the case of the filing of the ZM in particular, taxpayers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the omitted levy of a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
Pursuant to Section 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the Chief Financial Officer is obliged to verify the information in the ZM or correction ZM, to remove any ambiguities and to use the information for fixing the tax liability.
In the event of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxpayer corrects false information in the ZM by filing a correction ZM either on his own initiative or after request.
The financial official must correct the data on the supply of goods to other Member States in the system ATIS if:
– the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction-ZM) and therefore corrects it by issuing a correction ZM,
– the tax officer has demonstrated the incorrectness of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Recounts entered by the tax officer without a correction-ZM being submitted by the taxpayer do not replace the duty of the taxpayer to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that These are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
Data from the ZM will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority referred to for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the Ministry of Sales at the Ministry of Finance). The CLO automatically receives the message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member States.
It contains all the incorrect VAT idNo. specified in the ZM lines transmitted.
Will be the inaccurate USt-IdNr. Used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of false VAT idNo.
The list contains a "Notice of Doubt concerning USt-IdNr."
The finance official reviews the data and enters the outcome of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxpayer must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the designated lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech taxpayer in their VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods specified by the supplier from the other Member State in their ZM are provided by the CLO forwarded to the relevant FA for consideration.
The clerks there must investigate the discrepancies.
There may then be three different situations:
(a) The value given by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of its VAT return is lower than the value of deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the finance officer checks the accuracy of the disclosures.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation can be determined either by a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or by a change of information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer gives in the meantime on his own Initiative a supplementary VAT return).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
(c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States as indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return is higher than the values of their goods supplies reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the finance official enters the results of his review in ATIS.
These results are forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for review can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 from Figph No. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO has decreased the number of cases submitted by the CLO for the individual quarters of 2005.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the data in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error on the part of the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error on the part of the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the different types of deliveries in the ZM in the individual EC Member States.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions in the verified FIS are shown in Table 1.
Delivery and processing of summary notifications in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must surrender on a quarterly basis to ZM, which lists intra-Community deliveries by acquirer (§ § 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be handed over no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension for the filing of VAT pre-registrations is granted, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
Electronic levy has been mandatory since 1 January 2007.
The relevant FA can allow exemptions for individual taxpayers to avoid undue hardship.
If the taxpayer determines that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a correction ZM within one month.
In the event of non-surrender of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: – first reminder – second reminder, coupled with the threat of a penalty being set and – fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows the setting of a penalty of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets fines €125, €250 and €500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxpayer acts unlawfully if he intentionally or recklessly does not hand over a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he does not correct an ZM or does not correct it in time.
This breach can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into MIAS by the SIS because the CLO is solely responsible for processing the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary messages is not available to the FIS until they have been processed by the CLO.
The time limits for processing ZM are laid out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT idNo. In the ZM of German taxpayers, the German CLO receives a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.
It is then up to him to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs were the USt-IdNr. Corrected at the request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, as well as the threat and imposition of up to three consecutive penalties, takes too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were ultimately reported to the relevant subject, were usually closed within one to two monties.
The FA responsible refused the exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these maturities.
The taxpayer set the right VAT idNo. The FA asked him to hand over a corrected ZM to the CLO because the FIS cannot correct the MIAS data itself.
The BRH found that neither the FIS nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.
That is why taxpayers often failed to comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information provided in the VAT pre-registrations or the VAT return on the delivery of goods with the corresponding information in the ZM, before this data complies the CLO of the Be forwarded to other Member States.
This comparison can only be done by the subject. This is usually done when preparing a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States are processed by the CLO.
Incorrect USt-IdNr. Will be recognised and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data are used to control employment taxation in the FIS.
Once available in the system, it matches the CLO with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notices will be prepared and sent to the relevant FIS.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT payers is later drawn up and forwarded to the FIS.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment process then matches this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully (only) reviews those entrepreneurs who are not fully eligible to deduct input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must have a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter. relinquish.
The FIS process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by taxpayers to the ZM are matched by the FIS with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same taxpayers in their VAT returns.
The results of the reconciliation will be taken into account in the context of tax fixing.
In Germany, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, taxpayers have been required to file ZM electronically with the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FIS after they have been processed by the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, taxpayers in the ZM only state the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech Republic, the German FIS cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the ZM handed in itself.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT idNo. Even if the taxpayer has the correct VAT idNo. Shared to the FA.
The German financial administration does not match the information on intra-Community deliveries that German taxpayers make in their VAT pre-registrations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German CLO directs the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings from the BRH, it is obvious that matching would improve the reliability of the MIAS data submitted.
The data provided by other Member States on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers is compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchases of goods provided by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns Have indicated.
The Czech CLO makes the reconciliation separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FIS for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally check the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control is carried out only on taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community purchases of other taxpayers if the RMS has drawn up an audit notice or if the taxpayer has been selected for an audit anyway.
This procedure relieves the burden on the FIS from clarifying the reasons for any differences that arise.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time lag could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to hand over ZM monthly.
The monthly levy would only slightly increase red tape, as most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to file monthly VAT returns or – pre-registrations and for the ZM. No more information is required than for VAT returns or – forward.
In order to avoid red tape, the filing of the ZM could be linked to the filing of VAT returns or – in advance.
However, a duty to issue ZM on a monthly basis would create more periodic discrepancies between intra-Community delivery disclosures and intra-Community acquisitions, and increase data flows between CLOs.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed because of the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to submit ZM on a monthly basis to have an effect, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on the supply of goods and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both Court of Auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT points. In the O _ MCTL notifications exchanged for the individual audited quarters between the Czech Republic and Germany.
This data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTLNews was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community turnover and on the taxpayers who have carried it out.
Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of the Council on Administrative Assistance in the field of Additional Tax, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (' Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of the Council '), distinguishes between two basic types of Exchange of information: Exchange of information at the request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is made by a request for information (RFI) using the standardised SCAC preprint.
Finance officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to an RFI received through the Finance Directorate to the CLO. This ensures the translation of the information provided in the standardised SCAC pre-print into the foreign language and the forwarding of it to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the responses to submitted requests. It concerned their translation into the Czech Republic and their distribution to the relevant experts for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFI exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NKcomo.
70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were reported from the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany. processed within the three-month period; In a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) This processing period has been exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no response had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NKcomo. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Graph 2.
The total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic was made in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) A response within the three-month period; Another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) After the expiry of this period, a reply from Germany had not yet been received in 19 cases (in the remaining one case, it could not be determined when Germany made the request for information. ).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Graphics No. 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community turnover shown in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graphics No. 4.
The graphs above show that the sales audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structures automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Finance officials from other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for fixing the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States is made electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
' Structured automatic exchange ' means the systematic transmission of previously established information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States of the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the pre-print notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with section 19 of Law No. 235/2004 as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.
In processing this advance, the Treasury Officer enters the required data into the relevant document template and forwards it directly to the responsible member of the Finance Directorate, where this data is collected and processed to the CLO for further processing. Be sent. Thereafter, this data will be sent to the other Member States within the specified time limit, no later than two months from the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides the other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and potential "missing traders" .
This information will be communicated to the other Member States by means of a SCAC preprint in the spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.
The FIS send the completed pre-print SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC preprints to the foreign CLO.
The experts are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC pre-print used is single-language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by BRH were sent to ensure the taxation of employment in the other Member State or to ensure the tax exemption of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member State. Prove.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information on a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO shall take care of the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC pre-print [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or English.
In order to respond to the request for information, the CLO directs this to the relevant FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor the time limit, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FIS of the answer to the unfinished requests for information.
The FIS receive the required information by writing to the taxpayer or conducting an external examination.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: The VAT Special Audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT follow-up, which may only refer to a recent Operation took place.
This short and flexible form of examination does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proved its worth in examining a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany transmits the following information to the other Member State: – on VAT, which have been allocated to companies located in other EC Member States, – on the reimbursement of input tax to entrepreneurs who are in Other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC Member States as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., (b.) distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a taxpayer and The MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of items inadvertently subject to taxation by the taxpayer in Germany. Potential "Missing Traders," which are intra-Community Have made sales, regardless of whether their UStIdNr. Is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as f. taxpayers who have made intra-community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have a VAT ID. Misand used.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local experts, who transmit the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information into English or German, the German experts follow the instruction, requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual Pressure only to be drafted in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
In considering requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005, the NKcomo found that the Czech Financial Administration had 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period While requests for information addressed to Germany were settled by the German financial administration only in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO points the FIS to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of short-term answered requests for information.
That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has changed in the meantime.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities of answering the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Risk Tax Policy and Economic Administration Department or its Risk Management Unit deals with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenues and evaluates trends in these risks in domestic and domestic and national Intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "Credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk goods, conceptually prepares risk management in the area of VAT and works in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the others. Member States together.
The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the area of VAT provides, among other things, the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system, provides Public relations and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The Tax Assessment and Investigation Department conducts, inter alia, risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, Compile risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collect information from the financial administration and other sources, and make proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigators are held by the financial directorates. Its tasks include finding taxpayers and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), finding unregistered taxpayers (e.g. in the Sectors Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of interconnectedness in chain fraud cases and the information of local tax authorities.
Special test units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.
They have regional jurisdiction and, as a result of appropriate authorization, carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the FIS.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in relation to chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of the tax investigators or focus on taxpayers with certain activities, multinationals and taxpayers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the system ATIS: – the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-bearing tax returns, – the task of "selecting The taxpayers under audit, "whereby the taxpayers under audit are selected on the basis of certain criteria, – the task of" MIAS, "which allows the finance officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task "MIAS" makes the following possible: – check the validity of the USt-IdNr. Taxpayers from other Member States, – confirmation of the value of goods delivered to a Czech taxpayer, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxpayer concerned from other Member States, – creation of a List of taxpayers who have not provided ZM – formal control of the information provided to taxpayers in the Czech Republic before these disclosures are transmitted to other Member States, – draw up a list of the Taxpayers in whose VAT returns do not match the information in the ZM on the delivery of goods to other Member States – draw up a list of taxpayers in whose VAT returns provide the information on the value of the Other Member States did not match the information in the ZM of all their suppliers from other Member States.
As part of their responsibility to combat tax evasion, financial officials have access to the data from state authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, commercial registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in the section 4.4.1 submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Because of their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (especially the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a uniform data base.
At CLO level, the ST I 2 unit (' KUSS ' – Coordination Unit for Recorded Tax Examinations and Tax Investigation) collects the audit findings on fraud cases in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up in the USS. There, the tax offices can enter and also query the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of sales tax fraud nationally and cases of cross-border sales tax fraud.
The experience of the KUSS is brought to bear in the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other CLO and BMF organisational units are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. Other Member States that appear in the ZM of German taxpayers are carried out by the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The examination of the validity of the USt-IdNr. The O _ MCTL identifications submitted by the other Member States are carried out on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifications (for the procedure of correcting invalid VAT ID, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS relies on the MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of communications for the discovery of suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics are used as clues, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The State's officials are instructed to process these communications and must forward the outcome of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features must be included in order to infer a case of tax fraud with sufficient probability (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different indications in the preparation of the messages.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the taxpayer's payment behaviour, the industry or the company's shareholding relationships.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system compiles a list of those taxpayers who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-registration or declaration of the annual financial year.
This list will be sent to the CLO to monitor the full submission of the ZM.
Furthermore, this type of risk management compares the purchases indicated by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return with the data in MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; Such as.:
– Supplier and purchaser assume different times for the execution of intra-Community turnover;
– different accounting collection and tax explanation of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on data in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. Company words, age of the owner partner, number of employees and payment method of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a fixed rules-based risk management system that allows a team of anti-tax fraud specialists (' risk managers ') to programme their own rules so that suspected tax fraudsters Filtered out.
This system is used in the processing of VAT forecasts by the FIS.
This gives the relevant FA the guidance of the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adjust the rules according to feedback from the FIS.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data uncovered in the rear of the background.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics for tax evasion.
The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent subjects decide on the examination of the taxpayers concerned.
After the audit, tax auditors must report their findings so that the RMS can learn from the results of the exams it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called a data-mining system) calculates how likely a taxpayer is to be mired in tax fraud.
After that, it creates a monthly list of suspected tax cheats.
Based on this list, the FIS select the taxpayers in question for examination and report the exam results to the data center in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the federal states.
Because each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems purposeful.
Whether the hoped-for effects will materialize with the actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
While it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech and German, the NKcomo and BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – carousel fraud in particular – has proved to be a problem not a national but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. Failure to do so, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their offences.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is located.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales As part of the parallel audits, the NKcomo and BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and the
The international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two Rech-ding Courts jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, which there were doubts about the implementation, or which the taxpayers of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKcomo examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKcomo examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxpayers had stated in their tax returns and ZM, on the basis of communications from the BRH.
At the request of the NKkok, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 via the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases revealed, among other things, that the different procedures for registration in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased €60,500 worth of goods from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech Financial Administration sent a request for information to Germany to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer in question had goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €31,997 in the fourth quarter and €31,997 in the fourth quarter. Quarter worth €10,276.
It also emerged from the reply that the USt-IdNr. The German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted another request from the German taxpayer and the validity of the USt-IdNr. Retroactive to 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was an (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
By asking the relevant tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKcomo found that in 2004, the Czech taxpayer had submitted supplementary VAT returns for the individual (subannual) tax periods during which he Declared a higher value of acquisitions from other Member States and, at the same time, coveted the deduction of input tax from acquisitions from the other Member States.
The competent clerk of the Czech Tax Office could not clearly determine on the basis of these additional VAT returns whether the value of the deliveries of the aforementioned German supplier was also included in the declared acquisitions.
In response to a request for information from the NKkok, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as liable to VAT in September 2003.
When registering, he had not applied for the allocation of a USt-IdNr., but only a tax number that eventually applies to Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively give a taxpayer a VAT idNo. In 2006, the competent clerk of the German financial administration did so retroactively to 1 May 2004.
Germany's CLO shares a VAT idNo. Retrospectively, if the deaf entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; For example, if the CLO has the delay according to the request of the taxpayer to issue a VAT ID. Caused.
In this case, the CLO grants the VAT IdNr. Retroactive because the entrepreneur does not have a valid USt-IdNr for an intra-Community delivery in accordance with § 6 UStG. Required.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID. Its supplier to explain the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted the VAT ID. In this particular case, retroactive.
2nd.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech finance official requested a review of the German entrepreneur's VAT registration.
The MIAS data show that the date of registration of 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA states 1 October 2004.
The German authorities said in their reply that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons it was not until 16 February 2005 in Germany that the German taxpayer had a USt-IdNr. Get allocated.
By request from the local Czech finance official, the CFO learned that the tax officer had carried out a VAT check on the Czech taxpayer for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
In that audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9.897 that he had provided to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration. i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) Tax Office set a tax liability of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 against the Czech taxpayer.
On the basis of the request of the NKkok, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had the USt-IdNr. Was only assigned when he registered with the FA on 16 February 2005 when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004.
In addition, the FA retroactively registered him for VAT purposes from 1 October 2004 in order to be able to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxpayer stated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approximately CZK 5,000).
3. In his VAT return for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer indicated deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxpayer.
When reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS system, the Czech finance official found that this registration was not valid until 11 November 2004 and therefore after the deliveries of goods to Germany.
The Czech taxpayer issued a supplementary VAT return declaring sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and CZK 21.777 in sales tax, which he paid.
By asking the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKcomo found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted an application for the resumption of the tax procedure in relation to the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he filed a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech finance official checked the validity of the German taxpayer's registration as part of the international exchange of information.
It emerged from the German information that the German taxpayer did not become a VAT ID until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of the delivery of goods. had been assigned.
As a result, the Czech finance official dismissed the request for the resumption of the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German taxpayer did not become a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004. Had received.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the sales tax on it, and also requested the reimbursement of input taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the German taxpayer's tax liability, the German finance official did not correct the disclosures in the VAT return.
The BRH also noted that the German taxpayer's company referred to in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.
This change of name with the German taxpayer also confused the Czech finance official.
4th.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German finance official reviewed the purchase of goods by a Czech taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005 from a German taxpayer worth €22,686.
By asking the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKcomo found that the Czech finance official had examined to the Czech taxpayer as part of an external audit of whether the intra-communal delivery In fact, and whether the Czech taxpayer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-municipal acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier in the bill did not use his VAT ID. Only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxpayer will not be registered for the VAT in connection with intra-Community sales until 21 April 2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech Finance Officer also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the German taxpayer's registration certificate so that he could initiate an appropriate tax procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA regarded this transaction as the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set VAT for the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a taxpayer delivering goods to other member states did not have a VAT ID. For intra-Community deliveries must have in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier only needs the UStIdNr. The purchaser in the other Member State and can prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, under German tax law, turnover is an intra-Community delivery (tax-exempt), which should be subject to employment taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech finance official took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community sales if they are below the minimum amount limit of €15,000:5.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech Finance Officer carried out an audit for this tax period.
As part of intergovernmental administrative assistance, the Czech Financial Administration requested the examination of this shipment of goods through a SCAC proposal.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he had not received the goods, had never been in business contact with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been booked with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transfer of documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – because the turnover was below €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech finance official did not receive any documents for a subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax fixing endured.
On the basis of a request from the NKkok, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as "Fiscal representent17" (§ 22 (a) – (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
As a result of the communication by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the German financial administration's responses to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the responses of the Czech financial administration:
6. During its audit, the NKcomo found that, on 5 October 2005, the Czech Financial Administration had submitted a request for information on the value of Wa-renrendeliver to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxpayer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €86,307; However, the Czech taxpayer only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period in his VAT return.
In response to the request for information which was given to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 of the Council, the German side stated that the request for information could not Because the German company was disbanded at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech financial official, using a SCAC preprint, requested that a supply of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth 1.265.554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, indicating that Carousel fraud.
The NKcomo noted that a German response to the request for information had not yet been received at the time of its examination.
By asking the local finance official, the NKcomo found that the Czech taxpayer had not explained in his VAT return the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German taxpayer worth 11.816.103 CZK.
The Czech financial official corrected the details in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for consideration.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out on the German acquirer in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all the vehicles in question had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were resold to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By request from the local finance official in the Czech Republic, the NKcomo found that the Czech taxpayer had not issued a VAT return since August 2004.
Even after the request of the tax official, the Czech taxpayer did not issue tax returns. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to indit the said delivery from the German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax officer, the taxpayer made a request for information on the above delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the audit of the NKkok how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-fulfillment of the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxpayer was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only one partial answer was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKcomo and the BRH, the relevant FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9th.
In 2005, the Czech finance official requested, through a SCAC preprint, that a delivery of a motor vehicle shipment to a German taxpayer worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, indicating carousel fraud Templates.
In his response to the request for information, the German finance official stated that he had only the invoices issued by the Czech tax-payer for deliveries worth €16,335.
On the basis of the request of the NKkok, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA by the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth €16,335 double in its VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech finance official requested, through a SCAC preview, for a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth €198.167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with signs For carousel fraud.
The German financial administration sent a partial advertisement to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had acquired several motor vehicles, and that, moreover, that the investigation in Germany had not yet been carried out. Be completed.
The NKcomo found that the local FA had carried out several external audits with the Czech taxpayer in order to check the deduction of above-average upfront taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns for the period concerned the acquisition of goods from other Member States totalling €579,114, and that the German FA's audit of the acquirer in Germany Is not yet complete.
Section 4.4.1 outlines the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic dissenteat18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11th.
According to data from MIAS, the Czech taxpayer acquired €35,716 worth of goods from the German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005; However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the finance official and no business activity was carried out at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech finance official requested a review as part of the international exchange of information, such as: The German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed carrier.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer only supplied goods worth €9,659.
The Czech tax-payer sent the German taxpayer a false payment confirmation over the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
After detecting the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech purchaser, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the supplied material with the exception of part worth €7,916.
By asking the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKcomo found that the financial administration, on the basis of the information received to the Czech taxpayer, was, among other things, the return taxation of goods In the amount of 388,522 CZK to other Member States.
On the basis of a request from the NKkok, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €7,916 after corrections.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12th.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested, through a SCAC warning, to verify the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, the Czech taxpayer had delivered goods totalling €396,126 to the German taxpayer during the period in question and provided services worth €11,885.
The NKcomo found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit on the Czech taxpayer to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech Finance Administration announced that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and assembled a production facility for the German taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production facility prior to the Czech Republic's accession to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer did not take down the assembled production facility and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German production facility for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the regulations, but did not acknowledge them, nor did they pay for them.
By request from the local finance official in the Czech Republic, the NKcomo found that all invoices had been properly recorded on the Czech taxpayer's books.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer, which related to invoiced invoices after May 1, 2004.
The BRH found that, as a result of the Czech financial administration's response, the local FA concluded that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German, including the German The assembly done.
In this particular case, the place of fulfillment of this so-called plant delivery is where the production plant is assembled.
The German beneficiary of the factory delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a pre-tax deduction of the same amount.
As the German taxpayer's VAT bill remained unchanged, the German FA did not allow the VAT return to be corrected.
13. According to the MIAS data, Czech taxpayer A purchased a €58,000 machine from German taxpayer C in February 2005.
The Czech finance official made a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German site stated that German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, who returned it to German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but was transported to the establishment of German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.
It was also apparent from the reply to the request for information that German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) was only made within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
By request to the financial officer in charge of the taxpayer B, the NKcomo found that, according to the MIAS data, the German taxpayer C had the Czech taxpayer goods (another machine) in the third quarter of 2004, worth €88,027. Had delivered.
Taxpayer B said that he had not received this product, so that the local Czech finance official made a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigation by the taxman B, the finance officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been booked with the taxpayer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German Taxable C had delivered to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The NKcomo also found that the Czech finance official in charge of taxman A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The Finance Officer had the invoice of German taxpayer C dated 7 February 2005, in which the taxpayer A is to be specified as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech finance official noted that taxpayer A had not posted this bill.
Taxpayer A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company whose subject was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transportation.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of taxpayer A.
The BRH found that German taxpayer C had delivered the machine, worth €88,027, not to the Czech Republic but to another German taxpayer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not acknowledge the claim of German taxman C for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
German taxpayer D delivered the machine to Czech taxpayer B.
Under German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to sales tax in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also found that German taxpayer C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to Czech taxpayer A.
This delivery was not reviewed at the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below shows the contractual relationship between the business partners involved in the above transactions.
14th.
When examining requests for information received, the NKcomo found that, on 4 October 2005, the Czech Financial Administration had received a request for information from Germany in which a German financial official reviewed intra-Community deliveries. A German taxpayer worth 879.680.625 asked a Czech taxpayer.
The German finance official stated that there were suspicions that this was a fictitious intra-Community shipment of goods.
The German taxpayer had not carried out any active business activity since 1999.
The NKcomo found that the Czech finance official had carried out an external audit on the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company said that this was probably a claim of the German taxpayer to the German financial administration, which the Czech taxpayer, as a shareholder in the German company at the German FA Claim.
According to the information provided to the NKcomo, the Czech Finance Officer has so far no information that the German financial administration is handling the case with respect to the Czech taxpayer.
It is clear from the available information that it was not a delivery of goods; Nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in MIAS as an intra-Community shipment of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to disclose intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer delivered goods totalling €33,205 to a Czech taxpayer in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech finance official requested an audit of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the goods had personally collected the goods.
By request from the local Czech fi-nas official, the NKcomo found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the relevant period before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech finance official recommended a tax check on the Czech taxpayer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were submitted which showed a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount which was the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data. In line.
By request to the local Czech finance official, the NKcomo found that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the Czech taxpayer's accountant and remained with her in such a way that, after reviewing the Inquiring, together with the company owner, about the filing of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary sales tax return has been filed.
The Czech Finance Officer informed the NKcomo that it would proceed in such a way that the time limits for retroactive VAT fixing for the tax period in question were met.
17th.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered €16,600 worth of goods to the German taxpayer.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German finance official asked for a review of whether the aforementioned Czech taxpayers actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had a number of sham companies in Germany had founded.
In the course of the FA's review of the operation, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech taxpayer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer provided evidence for the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as liable for VAT in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech finance official sent this information to the German financial administration in his reply to the request for information.
By request to the local Czech finance official, the NKcomo found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of a tax audit, in which he, among other things, had the value of the goods. Declared which he had acquired from a German taxpayer and at the same time asserted the right of the deduction for acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech sales tax return, he did not report sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
Due to a supplementary VAT return issued after the external audit, the Czech finance official set the VAT liability unchanged.
Under Czech legislation, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech finance official drew a wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the response to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German taxpayer's tax return corrected and the payment of Sales tax worth €1,600.
In addition, the relevant FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods was properly taxed.
In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18th.
The Czech Finance Officer received a request for information from the German tax authorities on the question of whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
As an attachment, the request for information was accompanied by an imprint of the Czech taxpayer's VAT registration certificate.
As a further facility, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech finance official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had no contacts with a German taxpayer.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech Financial Administration.
With this information, the Czech finance official replied to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By request to the local Czech finance official, the NKcomo stated that the Czech taxpayer is not based at the address specified in the Commercial Register and that the managing director of the company is not reachable.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the tax period February 2005, the Czech finance official set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer with zero.
In the course of further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it based on an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German finance official had rejected the German taxpayer's claim to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer was said to have delivered €89,424 worth of goods to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not comply with the MIAS data, the German finance official requested the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech finance official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a relative of the Czech company's shareholder.
The Czech taxpayer issued a VAT return and an ZM signed after the cancellation of the managing director in the Commercial Register by a person not authorised to do so, namely that shareholder of the company.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax officer that the owner of the capital had paid the payment for the goods charged into the company's account in euros.
Box office receipts were not issued.
By request from the local Czech FA, the CFO found that the Czech taxpayer's entitlement to VAT exemption for goods deliveries to other Member States worth 1.326.307 CZK in the first quarter of 2004 and Recognized by 1.416.180 CZK in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German finance official did not correct the German acquirer's VAT return, as in the meantime a German court had upheld the German taxpayer's insolvency.
Since the earlier external audit showed no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to levy a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, in 2005, a German taxpayer acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth 4.251.196, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in his 2004 VAT return or in the 2005 return on sales tax.
In addition, he did not declare any output sales corresponding in value terms.
Because of these discrepancies, the German FA made a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community goods deliveries totalling 167.246.083 CZK.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech Finance Administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
The documents handed over to the NKcomo by the relevant financial officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, on 30 March 2006, a protocol on the commencement of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period From January to December 2005.
At the same time, the taxpayer was asked by the tax officer to provide all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.
The Czech taxpayer has not issued VAT tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel audit, the NKcomo, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of prior exchange of information between the two countries. Were.
The two Court of Auditors exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the relevant FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct taxable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but did not receive a German USt-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the manufacture of wind turbines and for their delivery to Austria in the name, risk and account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German taxpayer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to the German legal situation, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
– The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account for assembly.
Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
– Because the carrier was contracted by the Danish company (UDK) and had the latter carry out the transport in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-entrepreneur (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as liable for taxation in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), Since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the seat state of the Czech company.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
– The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
– The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria as well as intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all of its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKcomo found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there were no signs of Tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the NKcomo and BRH examined case designs to show the magnitude of the differences caused by the different legislation of 2004 between the data in VAT returns and the MIAS data.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for taxpayers and the subject to apply the new legal requirements:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxpayer reported shipments of goods totalling 792.977.452 CZK to a German taxpayer.
During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-Community deliveries to another German taxpayer with a total value of 18.157.265 CZK.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKcomo showed that both cases involved electricity deliveries.
Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKcomo found that in 2004, different legal requirements were in place for the supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
While in the Czech Republic taxpayers will supply electrical energy in accordance with the votes of Law No. Declared as intra-Community goods in 2004, according to the German statutory provisions in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal requirements were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further found that a Czech taxpayer was in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 intra-Community deliveries to a German Taxpayers with the total value of 240.411.163 CZK and another Czech taxpayer in his ZM declared intra-Community deliveries to another German taxpayer worth 263.470.776 CZK for the same period.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKcomo showed that in both cases they had been deliveries of electrical energy.
According to the wording of Law No. 235/2004, applicable on 1 January 2005, the place of performance in the case of the supply of electrical energy is the one where the purchaser has his legal place, place of business or place of establishment for which this delivery takes place.
That is why the Czech taxpayers should not have reported the supply of electricity in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a equivalent difference of 503.881.939 CZK in MIAS.
Final remark
The cooperation achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKcomo.
Both Court of Auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences between the two systems and the legal requirements applicable to VAT management.
During the parallel examinations, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions emerged.
For some of them, another observation is worthwhile.
Based on the audit results, both Court Courts developed recommendations for managing VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control check should be part of further monitoring.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both Court of Auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the area of VAT management.
