Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of turnover tax in the Czech Republic and Germany
The foreword:
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the Court of Auditors has the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration calls for the Court of Auditors to have the power to examine tax collection as broadly as possible.
The organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxation to be an important component of public revenue.
The main thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit work of an Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenues.
This is particularly true of taxes, the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which the national auditors can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the auditors of other countries.
Consider, for example, the audit of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant loss of revenue in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Court of Auditors auditing in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the VAT and the MIAS system arose at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Court.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating Court of Auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures for VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the examination objects for the examination planning.
Achieving consistent and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual Member States (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and increase transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but may also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international information exchange.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of turnover tax in the Czech Republic and Germany
An introduction to the game
File number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT following the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
Commission's audit target:
(CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the "EC") with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on administrative assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to remedy them.
Based on an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006, the audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Justice ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The main areas of cooperation were the verification of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between financial administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The period examined covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two Court of Auditors.
In addition to the focus on the exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were examined, such as the registration of tax liabilities, tax returns and summary notices.
The examination also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for purposes of VAT.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is the violation of the VAT threshold laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, tax fleets receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax filer receives a tax number valid only for domestic sales for purposes of VAT.
If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but is entitled to deduction of VAT.
In Germany, as far as the route passes through Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities are only required to file VAT returns for tax periods of less than one year (month or quarter), tax authorities in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Pre-registrations of VAT and after the end of the calendar year a declaration of annual sales tax.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax preparers in Germany must submit VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the VAT electronic levy in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summarized messages.
While tax preparers in the Czech Republic are required to file their Summary Notices with the Internal Revenue Service (FÄ), German tax preparers are required to file the Summary Notices with the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information contained in the Summary Notices will be available to the FÄ in the Czech Republic as soon as they are filed.
The data from the Summary Reports are only available to German FÄ only after their processing by the CLO.
Updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed to combat VAT fraud as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of Summary Notices would shorten the period between the time of the turnover and the update of the MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In the event of a request for information, the Czech CLO will monitor compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German tax administration has dealt with a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the prescribed time limit.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a permanent monitoring of the time limits (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful RMS criteria, elements or approaches must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
In the context of cooperation, the two Court of Auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using CLO's legal options where there were doubts about correct taxation or suspected VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the tax subject.
In these cases, the tax authorities had either unlawfully taken advantage of the VAT exemption or failed to declare the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to differences in legislation between the two Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which tax authorities have incorrectly reported turnover in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the experts (the FÄ) had to determine in these cases (see 6).
The review process
Examination procedures in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Examination Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
Verified bodies were: Ministry of Finance and 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of NKÚ approved the findings of the audit on 23 April 2007.
Testing procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the examination area Traffic Taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual testing began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the audit with several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following cases were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich Corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-North and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-North, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig and Zopschau.
Talks were also held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both Court of Auditors took place.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the legislation on the sales tax and the system of the sales tax administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were identified for the parallel tests: 1.
Registration of tax fugitives.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the approach of financial officials to the processing of requests for information and the verification of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous exchanges between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summarized messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the sales tax area.
At a meeting in December 2006 to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests already achieved.

An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000, shall be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of the Law Nr. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning the VAT; hereinafter "Law Nr. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow for the retroactive registration of a taxable person who has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to turnover tax or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must also be registered for VAT if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other conditions set out in Law No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
The registration procedure under Law No 337 / 1992 commences with the receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer.
Those who wish to register voluntarily for VAT must specify in their application the date on which they apply for registration as a VAT subject.
The financial officer has to check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information contained therein, he shall ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
Once the financial officer has verified that the trader meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written communication on the registration and allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the tax officer is required to indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the period of disposition for the VAT.
The investment period is the calendar quarter; unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the disposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the preceding calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 is entitled to choose the calendar month as the fixed period and has to inform the financial officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration decision always has a constitutive character.
The taxable person has to give the tax number in every communication (including payments) with the tax officer, and also in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law Nr. 235 / 2004 concerning the preparation of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the encoding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as this is determined by a special law. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No. 337 / 1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligations despite the corresponding request by the financial officer, the local responsible financial officer shall register him as such.
A communication will also be issued, which will be sent to the taxman.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business will receive a tax number at the time of his first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to the registration as a VAT payer.
According to law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register the VAT, the tax officer may require that the taxable person should have registered up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover that the person has unlawfully made without taxation for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person, up to the date on which the registration as a taxable person was made by order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of the law Nr / 235).
The payment of this amount shall be deemed to be a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law Nr. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements exist, the registration of a VAT subject can be deleted for two reasons:
1) There's no getting away from the fact that there's a lot of people out there who don't know what's going on.
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxable person, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
A tax preparer may request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force mentioned in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of the registration of official acts (§ 106 (7) of Law Nr. 235 / 2004) if: a) the taxable person has not performed any service in the period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax official of the reasons for it; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations in accordance with Law Nr. 235 / 2004; c) the previous tax person no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax liaison.
B) Tax subject without legal domicile, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have a legal domicile, registered office or place of business in the Czech Republic, or a tax resident foreigner who performs services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes ("non-resident entrepreneur") in accordance with § 108 of Law Nr. 235 / 2004 for these services or deliveries shall be liable to pay tax on the provision of the services in question.
He must submit an application for registration with the FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
In this application, he is obliged to indicate all the USt-IdNr. assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than the date of the first tax-efficient provision of services in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively as he became subject to turnover tax on the date of the first tax-efficient provision of services in the Czech Republic, in accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004.
In the event of a retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require a document (invoices or written explanations) from the contractors concerned to provide proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the contractual documents justifying the performance.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with the FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
According to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law Nr. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is authorized to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or tax returns and to pay taxes.
During the examination of the NKÚ, it turned out that in the case of the filing of a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of deletion of registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to cancel the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax preparers in Germany
Pursuant to the provisions of the Ordinance on Taxation (§ § 137, 138 AO), any business operation must be notified to the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This notification must be made no later than one month after the start of business.
The municipality will forward the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has commenced but has not been notified, it may also register the tax lien retroactively.
Regardless of whether they are resident or not, tax evaders in Germany are required to register for VAT on Zwekke if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the level of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special FÄ are responsible for entrepreneurs residing abroad.
For example, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who have their registered office in the Czech Republic.
As of 30 April 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs had been registered with this company; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs had been registered there.
According to the findings of the BRH, these special jurisdictions frequently refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new or Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the Community, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own businesses.
These self-employed persons do not fulfil the conditions laid down in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the way in which they carry out their work.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire drawn up by the competent FA and provide information on the company and the activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all German universities.
It is processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the organizational units generally responsible for the tax planning.
With the help of this preprint, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual tax subject before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the controller, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries, he needs a USt-IdNr.
This is assigned by the CLO on request, if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for sales tax purposes.
The USt-IdNr. is automatically assigned by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-Community deliveries in his or her VAT declarations or in his or her annual declaration of VAT.
The USt-IdNr. is composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. when he ceases to do business), but only after the completion of all tax transactions (predisposition of all financial years) or 2. If the tax administration determines that he is no longer running a business.
As a rule, the validity of the USt-IdNr. depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID can be terminated at that time.
According to the German Sales Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax fleets do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. is unlikely to exceed the amount of €50,000 in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and file an annual sales tax return.
A small businessman can explain the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then invoke the VAT and deduct the pre-tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a Fiscal Representative (§ 22a UStG).
A precondition for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfills the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for the purposes of the VAT.
The accounts indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two countries is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but due to different organisational structures in the different federal states, differences can occur.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the case of its registration for the VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for sales tax purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically request the allocation of a USt-IdNr..
Both NKÚ and BRH found that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which grants a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where the taxman does not register his business activities with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows a valid predisposition to the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT debt.
As the different registration procedures cause problems, the rules should be harmonised across the EC.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office of Taxation to each natural person after birth.
This number is valid for natural persons resident in Germany for life.
When a natural person commits a business activity, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as the USt-IdNr..
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a tax subject and the allocation of the USt-IdNr..
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the administration of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of § 70 of Law No. 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004 the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States as well as between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduction of VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport of persons who are registered as tax subject in other Member States or foreigners who are tax subject in their own country is carried out.
The return journey is considered to be a separate transport procedure.
If non-resident entrepreneurs do not carry out any economic activity in the Czech Republic other than cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as taxable entities in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport has been exempted from VAT in accordance with the Act on the Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b), which states in the text:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, pursuant to point 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the conditions of Article 28 (4) of the Directive are met or until the same exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as transposed in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a carriage service shall be carried out where the carriage is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.
Nor does German taxation distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person is transported through Germany, the part of the carriage which is attributable to Germany is deemed to be taxable.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each motor bus mentioned in the registration of the tax subject.
The entrepreneur must state his taxable transport services in a German VAT declaration.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the Chemnitz-Süd FA.
If the transport service is provided for a domestically resident entrepreneur, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is called the "transfer of tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax preparer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transportation:
Customs mobile control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups submit an inspection report to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer may deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT declaration, it may order an audit to be carried out in the FA or use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see no. 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the legally established value added tax, the FA may request administrative assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT declaration or the compliance with the tax law by a non-resident bus operator to be too burdensome in relation to the low income from the VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, auditing the books of a non-resident tax preparer causes disproportionately high costs for the tax preparer himself and for the tax administration.
The latter must check the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language but also of the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, in the case of such an examination, a higher amount of time is to be expected than in the case of a resident tax inspector, although the examination is limited to the passenger transport carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national tax administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxing entity must comply with all existing tax legislation in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two countries.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States as well as between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Czech Republic's Act of Accession to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to turnover tax in accordance with the route of carriage which falls within German territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify this to the competent FA in advance.
This registers the taxable person who has to declare the taxable part of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax fleets registered with the Chemnitz-South FA have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The amount of tax involved is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
The Member States which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax burden.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state in which the carriage begins or where the service provider is resident.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
Sales tax returns
Taxation and processing of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic
Insofar as the law does not stipulate otherwise, the entrepreneur, even if no tax liability has arisen, is obliged to file a VAT return on the pre-print provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.
The tax liability arises with the expiry of the deadline for submitting the VAT declaration. According to Law No. 235 / 2004, the VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
In the event of a refund claim resulting from higher than average deductible taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the determination of this deduction, without the need for an application.
The time limit shall not be applied in cases in which the tax officer initiates a tax procedure concerning the tax liability of the taxable person.
Pursuant to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the right to deduction may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim to deduction of deduction arose.
After the expiry of this period, the deduction can still be claimed within three years of the end of the period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary tax return.
An amendment to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT declaration only for the period during which the right to deduction of VAT could have been claimed for the first time.
A tax litigant must file a supplementary VAT declaration if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections by which the last known tax liability is not changed, but only previous information is changed, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax debt in accordance with § 49 of Law No. 235 / 2004.
A tax preparer may file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
Revenue tax returns can be filed electronically either via the Internet or via data carriers.
The delivery via Internet can be made with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on a medium.
The preprint for the VAT declaration contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT declaration.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls within the framework of the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as taxable will be compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their Summary Notices.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered as taxable persons is compared by means of the MIAS with the information contained in the Summary Statements of tax fleets from other EC Member States.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, a credibility check of VAT returns is carried out by the FA.
This is done automatically, as the VAT declaration cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility test involves a calculation of the measures of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
According to the provisions of § 37 (1) of Law Nr. 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by Czech tax offices for technical support of tax collection.
The NKÚ found during its examination that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a financial penalty on the tax subject if he did not file the VAT return.
Tax and processing of VAT declarations in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT declaration.
Those tax preparers who are required to file VAT pre-registrations must nevertheless file an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not required to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.
The taxable persons are generally obliged to make a VAT pre-registration (§ 18 (2) UStG) until 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is generated.
However, if the VAT liability is more than €6,136 in the previous year or if the company is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obligated to make monthly VAT pre-registrations at the latest up to 10 days after the expiry of the relevant month.
The taxable person can also opt for the submission of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he received a refund of more than €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual sales tax is not more than €512, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT declarations are required.
Any resulting VAT liability shall be paid 10 days after the expiry of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the reimbursement of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT declarations, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German sales tax law allows an extension of these (delivery or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. However, in the case of monthly notifications, a special advance payment is to be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-notification period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT declaration.
Once the VAT declaration to be filed by 31 May of the following year has been filed with the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT declaration.
Corrections of this VAT declaration to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT declaration was filed.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT declaration can normally only be corrected in cases of light-hearted tax reduction or tax evasion.
Taxpayers must submit VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The FÄ may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unfavourable hardship.
The annual VAT declaration can be made either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the delivery is made without certification, the tax administrator must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT pre-registrations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person 6.
In case of a late levy, the taxable person may be subject to a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier investigation, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not levy this late surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ levied the late fees, the amount was set in an uneven and arbitrary manner.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when submitting the annual VAT return.
The preprint of the VAT declaration contains separate lines for value indications for intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be indicated in a separate line of the VAT declaration.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are immediately available to the tax administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is electronically collected, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain benchmarks.
The selected VAT declarations must be checked by the competent official on the basis of the automatically generated test references (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax preparers must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the taxable period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
Depending on the amount of their tax liability of the previous year, tax filers in Germany have to file their prior filings at the latest 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual declaration of VAT must be made by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The ability to file an annual VAT declaration has a number of advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax administrator may correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by submitting a single VAT return;
- if the taxable person corrects his or her information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ICM;
- The Länder do not collect MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax preparers until the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT declaration regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy will enable the German tax administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the competent FA may compare the annual declaration of VAT with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the Internal Revenue Service can only check the level of turnover on the basis of the income tax return that has been issued.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax authorities are obliged to issue the VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the electronic filing of tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the effectiveness of the Czech tax administration.
A summary of the reports
Presentation and processing of summary notices in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of § 102 of the Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes is obliged to make such summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the goods delivered shall always be stated in Czech currency in accordance with the USt-IdNr7, the individual tax brackets under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information about services is not provided in the ZM.
Taxpayers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must submit the ZM to the local competent FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction TIM within 15 days of the error being identified.
Faulty data in the ZM will always be replaced by data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, tax filers can also file their returns electronically.
In the event that a tax officer does not provide a CM or a correction CZK, even though he is required to do so in accordance with Law Nr. 235 / 2004, the financial officer shall ask him to hand over the relevant CZM, pointing out the consequences of the non-payment. In the event of non-fulfilment of non-monetary obligations, the financial officer shall be authorised to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with § 37 of Law Nr. 337 / 1992.
The NKÚ found in its investigation that the FÄ mostly did not use its power to impose fines on defaulting tax evaders.
In particular, the tax faculty are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to pay the ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT debt.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Law Nr. 235 / 2004, the financial officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Correction ZM, to remove any ambiguity and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of non-conformity
8 of the information in the ZM with which The Tax Administrator corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The financial officer has to correct the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the taxable person does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or Correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- the financial officer has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the ZM or Correction ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax officer, without a correction ZM having been issued by the taxable person, do not replace the platitude of the taxable person to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up to date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ICs will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority, designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT, is allowed to transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is carried out by the Department of International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance) and the message "O _ MCTL" is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr., which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect USt-IdNr. is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the wrong USt-IdNr.
The list contains a "message about doubts regarding USt-IdNr."
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return intended for this purpose.
The CLO will forward selected cases of differences between the value of the purchases made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and the value of the goods delivered by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM to the competent FA for examination.
The experts there must investigate the discrepancies.
Three different situations can then occur:
a) The value specified by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of its VAT return is lower than the value of the supplies supplied by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his VAT return) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax preparer in the meantime issues a supplementary VAT declaration on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return.
c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech taxable person has indicated in his VAT return, is higher than the value of the goods delivered by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Again, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to check the accuracy of the information.
After verifying the differences and clarifying the reasons for their appearance, the financial officer enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent for examination by the CLO for each quarter of 2005 can be seen in graph No. 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graphic 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number of cases in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for requests for information to the other EC Member States.
Differences between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error of the taxable person in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies are indicated differently in the TIMs in different Member States of the EC.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions can be seen in Table 1.
Presentation and processing of the summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or who participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly reports listing intra-Community deliveries by acquirer (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The tender must be made no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of VAT declarations, this shall also apply to the ZM.
The ZM shall be submitted to the CLO.
The electronic levy has been in effect since 1 January 2007.
The competent FA may allow exemptions for individual tax areas in order to avoid unfavourable hardship.
If the controller determines that the ZM was faulty, he is required to submit a correction ZM within one month.
In the case of non-submission of the CZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat of a penalty and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows the imposition of a penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO imposes penalties of €125, 250 and 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) Nr. 5 UStG stipulates that the controller acts improperly, if he intentionally or recklessly issues a ZM not correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This infringement can be punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ into the MIAS, because the processing of the ZM is the exclusive responsibility of the CLO.
The data of the ZM are stored only at the CLO.
The information from the summary reports is only available to the FÄ after processing by the CLO.
The time limits for processing CCGs are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In case of incorrect USt-IdNr. in the ZM of German tax preparers, the German CLO will receive a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO does not manage to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then up to them to request the correct information.
In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the USt-IdNr. at the request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, as well as the threat and imposition of up to three consecutive fines, takes too much time when a tax evader may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases that were finally reported to the competent FÄ were usually closed within one to two months.
The competent FA refused to grant tax exemption for the notified intra-Community supplies in 73% of these forgeries.
If the controller provided the correct USt-IdNr., the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data itself.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the release of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the tax authorities often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the data on goods deliveries made in the VAT declarations or the VAT declaration with the corresponding data in the ZM before these data are sent to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by CLO.
Incorrect USt-IdN are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of income tax in the Member States.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares with data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notices will be drawn up and sent to the competent FÄ.
This happens continuously, whereas an auction of the acquisition data of all sales tax fleets is later compiled and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment process then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully verifies (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the deduction.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax preparers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State are required to submit a CZM to the local competent FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of the intra-Community deliveries notified by the tax authorities in the ZM shall be compared at the FÄ with the values of intra-Community deliveries specified by the same tax authorities in their VAT declarations.
The results of the reconciliation will be taken into account in the tax setting process.
In Germany, tax preparers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to file quarterly returns within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Since 1 January 2007, tax inspectors have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after processing by the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax authorities in the ZM state only the delivery of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. In contrast to the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot itself correct incorrect information in individual lines of the given ZM.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect USt-IdNr. was not corrected even if the correct USt-IdNr. was communicated to the FA by the controller.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries provided by German tax authorities in their VAT pre-registrations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are not regularly disclosed until the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.
Data on goods delivered by other Member States to Czech tax authorities will be compared in the Czech Republic with data on purchases of goods stated by Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general control will only be carried out in the case of tax evaders who are not fully entitled to deduct the deduction.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax entities only if the RMS produces a test reference or if the tax subject has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the FÄ of the need to clarify the reasons for any differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.
The current system of CCNs, in particular MIAS, provides information to the financial authorities that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the tax fleets had to submit monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only insignificantly increase the bureaucratic burden, as most tax evaders in the Czech Republic and Germany are already required to file monthly VAT returns or pre-registrations and no more information is required for the ZM than for VAT returns or advance declarations.
In order to avoid red tape, the ZM levy could be combined with the levy of VAT returns and / or advance declarations.
However, a shift to the monthly levy of SDRs would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community purchases and would increase the flow of data between CLO.
In 2006, the German government considered the general introduction of monthly SDRs.
The implementation failed because of the objections of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly forwarding of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the concentration on the monthly levy to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level, so that it is possible to update the MIAS data monthly.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No 2.
Both Court of Auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or USt-IdNr. in the O _ MCTL messages exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each of the quarters audited.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTLmessage was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information makes it possible for tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the tax transactions that they have carried out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003)") distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
The financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to an RFI received by the Finance Directorate to the CLO. The CLO is responsible for translating the information provided in the standardized SCAC form into the foreign language and forwarding it to the other Member States.
In addition, CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It ensures their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FÄ for processing.
Art. 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the tested period have been audited by NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74,5%) were dealt with within the three-month period; a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) exceeded this time limit.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ had examined it. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
The total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent from the Czech Republic to Germany resulted in 136 responses (i.e. 40.6%) within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases no reply had yet been received from Germany (in the remaining one case, due to the stated information, it was not possible to determine when Germany had replied to the request for information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic and Germany were answered can be found in Graphic No. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover reported in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graphic no. 4.
The above graph shows that sales audited in connection with requests for information generally had values of more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Information relevant to the determination of VAT liability is often transmitted to tax officials in other Member States without prior request.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected by the CLO.
The exchange of information between the various Member States will take place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously established information to another Member State without prior request, as soon as the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the form reporting the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of the Law No. 235 / 2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer will enter the required data in the relevant document and forward it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data will be collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. After that, the data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified time limit, namely within two months at the latest after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic will also provide other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential missing traders.
This information will be transmitted to the other Member States by means of an SCAC imprint in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local competent FA.
The FÄ send the completed preprint SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACpreprints to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used SCACprint is one-page.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the taxation of profits in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax-free status of intra-Community supplies from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the supplies referred to in the request exceeds the minimum limit of €15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely worded texts in the SCAC preprint [(B1-17) or (E), if they are not written in either German or English.
In order to respond to the request for information, the CLO shall forward it to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German treasury.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ to respond to unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ receive the necessary information by writing a letter from the controller or carrying out an external inspection.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all tax-related transactions over a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
In this short and ﬂexible form of examination, an announcement to the tax inspector is not necessary and it has proved its worth in the examination of a single transaction.
With regard to the automatic exchange of information, Germany shall provide the following information to the other Member State: - on USt-IdNr., which have been allocated to undertakings established in other EC Member States, - on the reimbursement of pre-tax payments to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has committed itself to providing the following information to the other EC Member States in the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. The supply of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT, b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant differences between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods which have been incorrectly subject to taxation in Germany by the tax authorities. Potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-Community sales, regardless of whether their UI number is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as tax evaders who have made intra-Community deliveries to the USD or misuse of a number.
Comparison and evaluation
The request for information or spontaneous information is sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local competent FÄ, who send the appropriate SCACPrinters to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACPrinters (Czech-English) and translates information given into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous requests on a one-language form only in German.
The German CLO does not make translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005, NKÚ found that 74.5% of requests for information received were dealt with by the Czech tax administration within the three-month period, while requests for information sent to Germany were dealt with by the German tax administration in 40.6% of cases within that period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of reminders, a high proportion of requests for information that have been answered for a limited period of time occur.
For this reason, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices to reply to the outstanding requests for information.
Sales tax risk management
Risk Management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the field of turnover tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Administration of the VAT or its Risk Management Unit deals with the identification of potential risk areas for the tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of VAT returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community supplies and purchases.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares the concept of risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and other Member States.
The department for international administrative assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and creation of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available from other Member States in the MIAS system, carries out publicity work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Tax Audit and Investigation Unit carries out risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, produces risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the tax administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigators exist in the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax subject areas and sectors which are high-risk in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax subject (e.g. in the sectors of Internet services, job placement, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in cases of chain fraud and the provision of information to the local tax authorities.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.
These have a regional competence and, with the appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the FÄ.
The need to set up special audit units resulted from the increase in detected new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly linked to chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or concentrate on tax fugitives with specific activities, multinational companies and tax fugitives with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the field of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-bearing nature of tax returns, - the task of "selection of the tax areas to be examined," whereby the tax areas to be examined are selected on the basis of certain criteria - the task of "MIAS," which enables tax officials to access data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task "MIAS" enables inter alia: - verification of the validity of the USt-IdNr. of tax fleets from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax plane in question from other Member States, - creation of a list of tax fleets who have not submitted ZM - formal control of the information provided by tax authorities in the Czech Republic in their ZM before these data are transmitted to other Member States - preparation of a list of tax fledgling persons whose VAT returns and other goods delivered to other Member States do not correspond to the value of all the goods purchased by ZM in the other Member States, and whose VAT declarations from the other Member States do not correspond to the ZM with the value of all the goods purchased in the other Member States.
As part of their mission to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, commercial registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the Summary Notices in the Czech Republic.
Risk Management in Germany
Because of its federal structure, both the federal ﬁnance authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 Länder are involved in the development and implementation of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
While there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the federal tax administrations have a fully unified set of data.
At the level of the CLO, the unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Centre for VAT Special Examinations and Tax Investigations) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at the KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates related cases of VAT fraud at national level as well as cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the KUSS is incorporated into the development of the RMS through its participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other CLO and BMF organisational units are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of other Member States' UICC No., which appear in the ZM German Tax Issues, will be carried out by the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the ICM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (s. 4.4.2).
Examination of the validity of USt-IdNr. referred to in the SDM is carried out on the basis of O _ MCTL identifications transmitted by the other Member States (see also 4.4.2 for the procedure for rectifying invalid USt-IdNr.).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of communications for the detection of suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics are used as clues, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and to forward the results of their investigations in certain cases to the CLO.
The BRH audit confirmed that all available features must be included in order to give a sufficient probability of concluding a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other factors, such as the payment behaviour of the taxman, the economic sector or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system draws up a list of those tax fleets who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the CLO for monitoring of the complete submission of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions specified by the taxable person in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The tax administrations of the Länder avoid comparing the quarterly data, as this would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud, such as:
- suppliers and acquirers assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community sales;
- different accounting and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of owners / shareholders, number of employees and method of payment of the tax lien).
Bavaria has introduced a rules-based risk management system that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter "risk managers") to program their own rules to identify suspected tax fraudsters.
This system finds the FÄ use when processing the VAT advance reports.
This means that the competent FA receives the information of the RMS before the value added tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers must adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of uncovered back-up cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FÄ decide on the examination of the tax subject.
After the audit, the auditors will have to report their findings so that RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rules-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this Neuro-Fuzzy system (also called the Datamining System) calculates how likely it is that a tax preparer is involved in tax fraud.
It then creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
Based on this list, the FÄ select the relevant controllers for testing and report the test results to the relevant data center.
The introduction of these three RMS is under way in the Länder.
As each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for combating fraud appears to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will materialize during actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German Länder, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be a European problem, not a national one.
Those involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State, but in several.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by European-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual sales In the context of the parallel tests, the NKÚ and the BRH investigated the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and / or.
Acquisitions which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the processing of several shipments, the execution of which was doubtful, or which the tax authorities of both states stated differently in their tax returns or customs declarations.
At the request of the BRH, NKÚ investigated a total of eight business cases involving between eight Czech and eight German tax authorities.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany that Czech tax authorities had indicated in their tax returns and ZM on the basis of communications from the BRH.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH inspected a total of 23 shipments between 23 German and 21 Czech tax authorities.
The relevant information was exchanged solely on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems identified in Chapter 4.1:
1 overall pick in the draft.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech tax preparer purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax preparer.
When the Czech tax inspector declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany for verification of the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax inspector in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
It also emerged from the reply that the USt-IdNr. of the German tax lien was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further request of the German tax litigant and brought forward the validity of the USt-IdNr. retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax inspector corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax collector.
By means of a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech tax inspector had submitted supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and, at the same time, requested the deduction of VAT from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the competent person in charge of the Czech tax office could not determine clearly whether the value of the supplies of the above-mentioned German supplier was also included in the declared purchases.
In response to a request for information from NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
Je-doch had not asked for the allocation of a USt-IdNr., but only a tax number that finally applies to Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a USt-IdNr. to a tax subject, the responsible person in charge of the German tax administration did so retroactively on 1 May 2004.
The German CLO retroactively assigns a USt-IdNr. if the German entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the application of the taxable person for the grant of a USt-IdNr..
In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. retroactively, because according to § 6 UStG the entrepreneur does not need a valid USt-IdNr. for an intra-Community delivery.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) USt-IdNr. of its supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO granted retroactive authorisation in this particular case.
2.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested the verification of the German entrepreneur's VAT registration.
The MIAS data indicate the date of registration of 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates the date of 1 October 2004.
The German authorities stated in their reply that the German tax lien had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons it was not until 16 February 2005 that a USt-IdNr. was assigned in Germany.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, NKÚ learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit of the Czech tax authorities for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this examination, the tax office found that the Czech tax administrator had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 which he had provided to the German tax authorities prior to their VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office determined a tax liability of CZK 1,880 against the Czech tax lien for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German tax inspector had not been assigned the USt-IdNr. until he notified the FA of his company founded in 2004 on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA retroactively registered him as of 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the submission of the VAT declaration for 2004.
In this VAT declaration, the tax resident stated intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. 5,000 CZK).
3. In his sales tax declaration for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax inspector stated shipments of goods worth 114,615 CZK to a German tax inspector.
When checking the registration of the German taxable person in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods had been delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax inspector issued a supplementary VAT declaration in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth 114,615 CZK and VAT of 21,777 CZK, which he paid.
By means of a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector subsequently submitted a request for the reopening of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT declaration. As proof, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax inspector had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official verified the validity of the registration of the German tax lien in the context of the international exchange of information.
From the German information it emerged that a USt-IdNr. had only been assigned to the German taxable person on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to reopen the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place, because the German tax inspector had only received a USt-IdNr. on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient explained both the acquisition and the intra-Community acquisition as well as the VAT on this and also requested the reimbursement of the same amount of advance taxes.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxable person, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT declaration.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German tax inspector named in the request for information was changed in Germany during the processing of the reply, which led to confusion between two German tax inspectors.
This name change at the German Tax Office also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax collector of a German tax asset worth €22,686.
By means of a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax inspector to ascertain whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax inspector had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax inspector did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his USt-IdNr. in the invoice, but only his tax number for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until April 21, 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax fugitive.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax inspector so that he could, if necessary, initiate an appropriate tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose any VAT on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, according to German law, a tax preparer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to qualify for the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must have only the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and must be able to document the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community supply according to German tax law, which should be subject to income tax in the Czech Republic.
It is important, however, that the Czech finance official took note of this business incident, because the supply of a machine of this value did not belong to the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum limit of €15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech tax preparer purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German tax preparer.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the context of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech tax administration requested the verification of this delivery of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech tax inspector stated that he had not received the goods, that he had never been in a business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been accounted for.
The German tax administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech tax official did not receive documentation for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax examination was inconclusive and the original tax determination was upheld.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxman acted as "Fiscal Representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax inspector explained these deliveries in his VAT declaration and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the communication from the BRH, the German FA will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the responses of the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the responses of the Czech tax administration:
6. During its examination, NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech tax administration had sent a request for information on the value of the Wa renders delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax authorities had reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax authorities only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period in their VAT return.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Art 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of a SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax collector worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousels fraud.
The NKÚ found that at the time of its examination a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.
By means of a request to the local tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax authority had not declared in its VAT declaration the supply of new motor vehicles to this German tax collector in the value of 11.816.103 CZK.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax inspector issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local competent FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT inspection was carried out on the German buyer in Germany. It was established that the purchase of all the vehicles concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were sold on to other tax authorities in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Czech tax inspector purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German tax inspector.
However, the Czech tax inspector did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By means of a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax inspector did not file tax returns even after being requested by the tax official. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA fixed the VAT liability at zero for the period October to December 2004.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction for the examination of the above-mentioned delivery from the German tax inspector.
As the Czech tax inspector did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
As the reply to the request for information was only received on 7 February 2007, it was not known, until the conclusion of the audit of NKÚ, how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to the failure to comply with the provisions of the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax flotilla has been cancelled with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial word was sent because, at the time of the audit of NKÚ and BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax collector in the third quarter of 2004, worth €16,991, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he had only the invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of a SCAC prescription, the verification of shipments of motor vehicles to a German tax collector worth €198.167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with indications of carousels fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, confirming that the German tax inspector had acquired several vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local competent FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech tax inspector in order to verify the deduction of above-average taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax authority had declared in its VAT returns for the period concerned the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579.114 and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the VAT declaration of the recipient and the information in the Supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it turned out that periodic inconsistencies in en18 or the incorrect declaration of a transaction as an intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States and its allies in the Middle East.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005 the Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German taxable person, but the Czech taxable person did not declare the purchase.
Since the Czech tax inspector did not cooperate with the tax official and there was no business activity at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official asked for a review of how the German tax inspector had communicated with the Czech tax inspector in the context of the international exchange of information.
The German reply to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax collector was unknown at the given address and the goods were collected by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax inspector delivered only goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax inspector sent the German tax inspector a false payment confirmation for the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German tax inspector.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax inspector, with the support of his other Czech customers, was able to recover the material delivered, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
By means of a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the tax administration subsequently imposed CZK 388.522 on the turnover of goods delivered from other Member States.
Following a request from NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had reported only one shipment of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €7,916.
According to the German legislation, the German tax authority declared the revocation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the revocation.
Its ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12, according to the Associated Press.
In the context of the international exchange of information, the German tax administration requested, by means of a SCACprepress, the verification of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech tax inspector had supplied goods to the German tax inspector with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11.885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit of the Czech tax inspector in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech tax inspector had delivered and assembled a production plant to the German one.
The Czech control plant supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was installed on the basis of the order after May 1, 2004.
The German tax inspector did not remove the installed production plant and asserted defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax administrator charged the German one €107,100 for the production plant and €11.885 for services.
The German tax inspector received the reprieve, but did not recognize it and did not pay it.
By means of a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, NKÚ found that all invoices had been correctly accounted for in the accounts of the Czech tax inspector.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax inspector and referred to invoices invoiced after the first May 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of a reply from the Czech tax administration, the local FA concluded that these sales were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax liabilities to the German taxpayer, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of fulfilment of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the delivery of the goods owes the value added tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient may claim a deduction of the same amount.
As the VAT liability of the German taxable person remained unchanged, the German FA did not correct the VAT declaration.
13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax preparer A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax preparer C in February 2005.
The Czech finance official sent a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax preparer C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax preparer B in 2004, but that he had returned it to the German tax preparer C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the aircraft was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch office of the German tax company C in the Czech Republic.
From the reply to the request for information it also emerged that the German tax preparer C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax preparer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the registered office of the German tax inspector in the Czech Republic.
As this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no joint delivery of goods.
By means of a request to the local tax official responsible for the tax plane B, the NKÚ found that according to the MIAS data, the German tax plane C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech tax plane in the third quarter of 2004.
The tax inspector B stated that he had not received the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations at Tax Plant B, the tax official found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been accounted for by Tax Plant B and that it could be the same type of machine as had been delivered to Czech Tax Plant A by the branch of German Tax Plant C in February 2005.
The NKÚ also noted that the Czech tax official responsible for the tax lien A had carried out an audit of the case.
The tax official had the invoice of the German tax plane C dated February 7, 2005, in which the tax plane A is specified as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official found that the taxable entity A had not accounted for this invoice.
Tax controller A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company, the object of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company ﬁrma delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information for the determination of the tax liability of the taxable entity A.
The BRH found that the German tax controller C had not delivered the machine worth €88,027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax preparer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognize the claim of the German tax-efficient C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German control plane operator D delivered the machine to the Czech control plane B.
According to German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005, the German tax preparer C had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax preparer A.
This delivery was not verified during the German FA tax audit.
The following illustration shows the contractual relations between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
In examining requests for information received, NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax asset worth €879.680.625 to a Czech tax entity.
The German finance official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.
The German tax preparer had not engaged in any active business activity since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax inspector.
The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim of the German tax inspector against the German tax administration, which the Czech tax inspector, as a shareholder in the German company, had lodged with the German FA.
According to the information given to NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far received no information that the German tax administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax case.
From the information available, it is clear that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax collector.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to state the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the beneficiaries (see Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax preparer delivered goods to a Czech tax preparer with a total value of €33,205.
However, the Czech tax inspector did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax inspector had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax inspector and that he had personally collected the remaining goods.
By means of a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector had issued a supplementary VAT declaration for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the value of the acquisitions could not be resolved, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit of the Czech tax authorities.
This examination has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax preparer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax preparer in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech tax inspector declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech finance official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent which showed a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax authorities and the MIAS data.
By means of a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech Tax Office and stayed with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she and the company owner wanted to discuss the issue of a supplementary VAT declaration for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary VAT declaration has been issued.
The Czech tax official informed NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactive VAT fixing for the relevant tax period would be respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax authorities delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax authorities.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for verification whether the so-called Czech tax fugitive actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax fugitive had established a number of phantom ﬁrms in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax inspector confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authorities, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax inspector presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxable person was not registered in Germany as subject to turnover tax and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official sent this information to the German tax administration in his reply to the request for information.
By means of a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector had issued a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he, among other things, declared the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax collector and, at the same time, asserted the right of deduction for the purchase from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT declaration he declared no VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration issued after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT debt unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case there was no acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech finance official drew the wrong conclusion in the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax authority and demanded the payment of €1,600 in VAT.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control communication to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, operators declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question of whether the Czech tax inspector had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax inspector in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax inspector.
A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was also included.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic, and that he had no contacts with a German tax collector.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By means of a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ established that the Czech tax office is not located at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is unreachable.
After a tax appeal procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax official fixed the tax liability of the Czech tax lien at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local competent German tax official had rejected the claim of the German tax inspector for exemption from the VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT declaration and the reported values from other Member States.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech tax preparer was supposed to have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax preparer.
As the acquisition declared by the German tax authorities did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of the supplies and payment of the supplies within the framework of the interstate exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax inspector issued a VAT declaration and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely that shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech tax office informed the tax official that the capital owner had deposited the payment received for the goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By request to the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax official had recognised the Czech tax authority's claim for VAT exemption on goods delivered to other Member States worth CZK 1.326.307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1.416.180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT declaration of the German acquirer, as a German court had meanwhile confirmed the insolvency of the German tax litigant.
As the previous external audit had shown no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he purchased goods worth €43,274 the previous year.
The German tax authority did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in its 2004 VAT return or in the for 2005.
He also did not explain the value of the initial sales.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA issued a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community shipments of goods with a total value of 167,246.083 CZK.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to verify whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax inspector had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company does not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
Documents provided to the NKÚ by the responsible tax official show that on 30 March 2006, together with the Managing Director of the Czech Tax Office, a protocol on the commencement of the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005 was drawn up.
At the same time, the tax inspector was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole Managing Director expired on 16 May 2005 without a new Managing Director being appointed.
Since April 2006, the Czech tax preparer has not filed any sales tax returns.
In the context of the parallel investigation, NKÚ, in cooperation with BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the two countries.
The two Court of Auditors exchanged information on the cases examined through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR) which is not domiciled in Germany informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-South) that it wanted to carry out taxable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German USt-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the manufacture of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax preparer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following diagram shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its own risk and on its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out on his own behalf, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were supplied to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as a taxable entity in an EC Member State (CR), no exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the country of residence of the Czech company 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) is also based on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The supply of the other wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community supplies in its German tax returns or in its customs declarations to the German CLO.
Consequently, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies in the same way as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NCP found that (UCR) had not notified intra-Community supplies to Austria, but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences between the VAT declarations and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation in 2004.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the tax authorities and the FÄ to apply the new legal provisions:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax preparer reported shipments of goods with a total value of 792.977.452 CZK to a German tax preparer.
In the same period, another Czech tax preparer reported in his ZM intra-Community deliveries to another German tax preparer with a total value of 18,157.265 CZK.
The information provided by the BRH to NKÚ showed that both cases involved electricity supplies.
Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their customs documents in accordance with Czech law No. 235 / 2004, which was in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of NKÚ found that in 2004 different legal provisions on the supply and acquisition of electricity between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the supplies of electrical energy to be intra-Community supplies in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, these were not intra-Community purchases of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law Nr. 635 / 2004, which changed some tax provisions as of 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech tax preparer declared intra-Community deliveries in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to a German tax litigant with a total value of 240.411.163 CZK and another Czech tax litigant declared intra-Community deliveries in his ZM for the same period to another German tax litigant worth 263.470.776 CZK.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that both cases concerned supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No 235 / 2004 applicable from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the acquirer has its legal domicile, registered office or place of business for which this delivery is made.
Therefore, the Czech tax authorities should not have specified the electricity supply in their 2005 SDGs.
The fact that both control faculties treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a material difference of 503.881.939 CZK in MIAS.
Final note:
The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both Court of Auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal provisions governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions came to light.
Some of these are worth further observation.
On the basis of the results of the audit, both Court of Auditors drew up recommendations on the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through cooperation between the two Court of Auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.
