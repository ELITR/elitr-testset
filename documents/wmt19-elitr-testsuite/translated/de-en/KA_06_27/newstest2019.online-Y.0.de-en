Report on the results of parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the Court of Auditors have the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the Court of Auditors have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.
The organisation of the European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important component of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activity of a Court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is particularly true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, there may be a situation where national auditors can carry out their audit activities only in cooperation with the auditors of other countries.
Examination of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant losses in many countries.
Cooperation between the authorities is necessary in the fight against such offences.
Auditors auditing in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an examination of VAT and the MIAS system was born at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Court.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the information available, we selected the subject matter for the examination planning.
Achieving effective and effective VAT management is a long-standing problem and individual countries (in particular EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify VAT collection and increase transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only help improve the work of financial management, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
introduction
Number: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2 — 2005 — 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Administration of VAT following the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
Objective of the Commission:
(CZ) The purpose of the examination in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as “the EC”) with the free movement of goods and services and the use of the MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the intra-Community VAT control system with a focus on administrative assistance in the field of turnover tax in accordance with the abovementioned Regulations.
As a result of the audit, vulnerabilities should be identified and recommendations to address them.
The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (“NKÚ”) and the Federal Court of Auditors (“BRH”) of the Federal Republic of Germany pursuant to an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the utilization of information obtained by international administrative assistance between the tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two States.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The period under review covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel testing
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two accounting offices.
In addition to the focus on exchanging information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were examined, such as registration of tax holders, tax returns and summary reports.
In addition, the examination also covered the legal situation in cross-border passenger carriage by coach and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
Comparing VAT administrations systems in the two countries identified differences in the following areas:
1) Registration for purposes of VAT.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the key criterion for registration is the exceedance of the turnover threshold established by the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxpayer receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for purposes of sales tax.
If the German taxpayer wishes to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the issue of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be standardised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Transboundary passenger transport by coach and coach.
In the Czech Republic, international passenger transport by coach and coach is exempt from VAT, but is entitled to deduct input tax.
In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/ EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic, tax declarations must only be submitted for annual taxation periods (month or quarter), tax payers in Germany (monthly or quarterly) have
and submit a VAT declaration after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax payers in Germany must submit advance VAT declarations electronically.
The introduction of VAT declarations in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary reports.
While tax holders in the Czech Republic must submit their summary reports to the financial authorities (FÄs), German tax authorities must submit the summary reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the Summary Notifications shall be available to FÄs in the Czech Republic immediately after their submission.
For German FÄs, the information from the summary reports is only available after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as promptly as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the update of MIAS data.
This would enable a timely assessment of taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO shall monitor compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the prescribed time limit.
Because of these problems, the Federal Republic of Germany recommended that the German CLO be constantly monitored (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two Court of Auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax subjects.
Of these, 31 cases were examined jointly by using the legal capabilities of the CLO in which doubts existed as to the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found the following:
In some cases, the FÄs used the information obtained from the international exchange of information and re-established the VAT liability of the tax authorities concerned.
In these cases, the taxpayers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not show the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FEs could not use the information obtained from the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused the information requested.
A number of cases have been identified where tax payers reported revenue incorrectly in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were accordingly incorrect, so that the specialists (the TEA) had to determine in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the CR
The audit was carried out in the period June 2006 to March 2007 by Division II — “State Budget Revenue” and the territorial audit departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited bodies were: the Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NKÚ approved the examination findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedure in Germany
The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the examination area Traffic Taxes and employees of the assigned PEB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual review began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the Federal Republic of Germany and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several Länder.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the exam was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following FEs were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich-Corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, HanoverNord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn city centre, Cologne Porz, Cologne-South , Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, discussions were conducted with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Dusseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the exam were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both Court of Auditors took place.
Participants at these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examinations were identified for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of tax payers.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by coach and coach — legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of financial officials in dealing with requests for information and the review of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the VAT area.
At a meeting to vote on the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel tests already achieved.

An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 shall be paid on the first day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of the Law No 235/2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter referred to as “Law No 235/2004”).
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow for retroactive registration of a taxpayer if he has exceeded the registration deadline.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or VAT exempt services with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if its turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, he or she but meets other requirements as specified in Law No. 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal seat, registered office or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
Upon receipt of the application for registration by the local competent financial officer, the registration procedure in accordance with Law No 337/1992 begins.
Anyone who wants to register voluntarily for VAT must specify in his application the deadline from which he applies for registration as a VAT subject.
The financial officer shall examine the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all the assets.
If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he shall request the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the financial officer has determined by verification that the entrepreneur meets the conditions for registration, he must issue a written notice of registration and allocation of a tax number.
The tax officer shall specify the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the tax assessment period.
The assessment period is the calendar quarter, unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover in the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the financial officer of this change.
The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice always has a constitutional character.
The taxpayer must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax officer, and in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law No 235/2004, concerning the production of tax documents) 3.
The tax code contains the code “CZ” and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this shall be the number of the birth certificate or any other general identification mark, insofar as a special law so stipulates. For legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (according to the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite the appropriate request by the financial officer, the local tax officer shall register him on its own motion.
A notification is also issued to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to conduct business will be given a tax number for any type of tax at the time of his first registration.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
In accordance with Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, the tax officer may, in the event of non-compliance with the VAT registration duty, require that the taxpayer be liable up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover which the person concerned has illegally carried out without taxation, in respect of the Period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a tax holder until the date on which registration as a tax holder was carried out by order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No 235/2004).
Payment of the amount thus fixed shall be deemed to be a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT subject can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No 235/2004).
A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration no earlier than one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Law No 235/2004) if: a) the taxpayer has not provided a service for the period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the financial officer of the reasons, b) the taxpayer has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No 235/2004; previous tax obligations no longer meet the requirements for tax liability.
B) Tax persons without a legal seat, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and who has no legal seat, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreigner who is liable for tax purposes in the The Czech Republic provides services and, in accordance with § 108 of Law No 235/2004, has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or supplies (“non-resident entrepreneur”) is subject to tax when the service concerned is rendered.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the relevant delivery.
It shall be required to indicate in this application all VAT IDs allocated to it in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, FA Prague 1 shall register it retroactively, as it is subject to VAT in accordance with Law No 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic. has been.
In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 is required to request proof of the service from the contractors concerned (invoices or written explanations).
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first execution of a service, FA Prague 1 must request the presentation of the contract documents that are based on performance.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. A total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered at 31 December 2005, of which 233 were from Germany.
Pursuant to § 106 (9) of Law No 235/2004, the financial officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to submit tax declarations or declarations and to pay taxes.
In the examination of the NKÚ it was found that in the case of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident trader for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year concerned.
Registration of tax payers in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulations (Sections 137, 138 AO), every business operation must be registered with the municipality and/or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business.
The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has begun but has not been notified, it may register the tax officer of its own motion retroactively.
In Germany, tax obligations are required to register for purposes of VAT, irrespective of whether they are resident or non-resident, if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Specific FÄs are responsible for entrepreneurs residing abroad.
For example, companies based in the Czech Republic are responsible for the FA ChemnitzSüd.
As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there as of 1 March 2006.
According to the Federal Republic of Germany, these FÄs, with special responsibilities, frequently refused to register so-called fake self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the accession of these ten countries to the EC, the free movement of workers is still restricted, these self-employed persons tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (note) self-employed persons do not fulfil the conditions laid down in § 2 UStG for recognition as an entrepreneur, since they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work performed.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information about the company and the business carried out in it.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄs in Germany.
It is processed either in special organizational units within the FEE or in the organizational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual taxpayer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identifying feature for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he must have a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO upon request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxpayer declares intra-Community deliveries in his/her VAT filings or in his VAT annual declaration.
The VAT ID number is composed of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he ceases business), but only after the completion of all taxation transactions (assessment of all fiscal years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he is no longer doing business.
Typically, the validity of the VAT ID number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In such cases, the FÄs must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number in order to terminate the validity of the VAT ID number at that time.
According to the German VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax payers do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the applicable sales tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 €and 2. the amount of 50,000 €will probably not be paid in the following year. exceeded.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to deduct input tax.
Although they do not have to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs are required to register with the tax office and submit an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur may declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration shall be binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the VAT and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident tax holders may appoint a tax representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free transactions and waive the deduction of input tax.
The tax representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that the foreign entrepreneur does not have to register for the purposes of VAT.
The invoices shall indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceedance of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences may occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the event of its registration for VAT, this tax number shall also apply to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who can register for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wishes to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH noted that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which provides a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, could lead to serious misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows for an accurate assessment of VAT for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.
Since the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be harmonised.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxes to every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person starts business, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a tax person and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on implementing an IT procedure for managing numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by coach and coach
Legal regulations in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to Article 70 of Law No 235/2004, the carriage of passengers between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT from 1 May 2004 and is entitled to deduction from VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons registered as taxpayers in other Member States or by foreigners who are liable to tax on their own.
The return journey shall be considered as a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the international carriage of passengers by coach and coach, they are not obliged to register as subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
Cross-border passenger transport was exempted from VAT in the Czech Republic pursuant to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Appendix V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The aforementioned body states in the text:
"For the purposes of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, maintain the exemption for international carriage of passengers either until the condition laid down in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or as long as the same tax exemption from any of the current Member States. “
The legal regulations in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b (1) of the VAT Act, a transport service is carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is liable to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person is transporting persons through Germany, the part of the transport which is payable to Germany is considered to be taxable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
The latter registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus mentioned in the declaration of the tax person.
The entrepreneur must indicate his carriage services subject to tax in a German VAT return.
As of March 1, 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered at the FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided to a resident entrepreneur, the non-resident tax person does not have to pay the VAT himself.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services shall pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident tax holder. This operation is referred to as “relocation of tax liability” and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax agent and his income tax return, the German financial administration has several means to verify the correctness of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:
Mobile control groups of customs check the certificates of buses registered abroad which are used for the carriage of passengers through Germany.
After each test, the mobile control groups shall transmit an inspection report to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax agent may deduct the VAT thus paid from the tax liability specified in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts as to the correctness of a VAT return, it may order an examination to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign tax officer refuses to pay the legally fixed value added tax, the FA may request administrative assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
The Federal Republic of Germany considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or compliance with tax obligations by a non-resident bus operator as too expensive in relation to the low revenue from VAT on passenger transport subject to tax.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxpayer causes disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the tax administration.
The latter must examine foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination requires a higher amount of time than a resident tax resident, although the examination is limited to the passenger carriage carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States in so far as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State where a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxpayer must comply with all existing tax obligations in the different languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the tax administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services entails disproportionately high administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation varies between the two countries.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempted from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route attributable to German territory.
If a non-resident tax officer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA in advance.
This registers the taxpayer who has to declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
The law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax payers registered at the FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to administrative burdens.
Member States, which levy turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax, have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of taxation, cross-border passenger transport should be subject to taxation only in one Member State.
This could be the State in which the transport begins or where the service provider is established.
Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise provided by law, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period, even if no tax liability has been incurred.
The tax liability is incurred upon expiry of the deadline for filing the VAT return. In accordance with Law No 235/2004, VAT on imports of goods is exempt from this scheme. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
If there is a claim to refund due to above-average deductible input taxes, this amount shall be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the date of the determination of this deduction, without the need for an application to be made.
The deadline shall not be applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the taxpayer.
Pursuant to § 73 (11) of Law No 235/2004, the right to deduction can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last taxation period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct was arisen.
After the expiry of this period, the deduction may still be invoked within three years of the end of the tax period during which it would have been possible for the first time.
For this purpose, however, a supplementary tax return is required.
An amendment to Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, permits the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period during which the right to deduct VAT could have been claimed for the first time.
A taxpayer must submit a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the adjustments leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes adjustments which do not alter the last known tax liability but only changes previous information, c) he pursuant to § 49 of Law No 235/2004 Adjustments to the VAT rate and the tax liability.
A taxpayer may submit a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the adjustments reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts were established.
The turnover tax return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carrier.
Submission via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.
The VAT return form contains separate lines indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of services received must be indicated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered as subject to tax shall be compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summary declarations.
The value of the acquisitions of goods from other Member States from persons registered as taxable persons is compared with the information contained in the summary declarations of taxpayers from other EC Member States.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA undertakes a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This is done automatically because the VAT return cannot be processed without the previous review.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the credibility criteria and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
Pursuant to § 37 (1) of Law No 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under that Act.
Automated tax information system — Automated tax information system used by the Czech financial authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄs seldom made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxpayer in case of non-filing of the VAT return.
Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly advance VAT declarations and the annual VAT return.
Those tax payers who are required to submit advance VAT declarations must nevertheless submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not required to pay VAT must submit an annual VAT return.
The taxpayers are obligated to submit a pre-sales tax declaration until the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the sales tax is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability in the previous year was more than 6,136 €or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly advance VAT declarations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The taxpayer may also opt for the submission of monthly pre-sales tax registrations if he received an amount above 6,136 €in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual VAT is not more than 512€, neither advance VAT declarations nor VAT returns are to be submitted.
A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the expiry of the tax period.
A refund may result in a more thorough review by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for processing VAT returns and reimbursement of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a guarantee for the refund amount may be offered.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed promptly.
The German VAT Act allows for an extension of these (payment or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the filing of pre-VAT declarations and the corresponding payments may take place one month later. In the case of monthly reports, however, a special prepayment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period December.
If an error is detected, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected advance VAT declaration.
There is no “supplementary” VAT return.
If the VAT declaration to be submitted by 31 May of the following year is submitted once to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect advance VAT declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Adjustments to this VAT return to the benefit or detriment of the taxpayer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was submitted.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.
The tax authorities must submit advance VAT declarations electronically.
The FEs may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardness.
The annual VAT return can be submitted either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the transfer is carried out without a certification, the tax person must also make the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no advance VAT declarations or declarations are made, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxpayer.
In case of late delivery, the taxpayer may be subject to a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of 25,000 €).
In an earlier examination, the Federal Republic of Germany found that the FÄs often did not charge this late surcharge.
In cases where the surcharge was imposed by the FÄs, the amount was set inconsistent and arbitrary.
The late surcharge therefore misses its purpose to reduce the average delay, particularly when filing the annual VAT return.
The VAT return form contains separate lines for the value of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable transactions shall be reported in a separate line of the VAT return.
VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
ThisSegmentIsIntentionAllyLeftBlank
After all data are collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain scales.
The value-added tax returns thus selected must be checked by the responsible specialist on the basis of the automatically generated audit notes (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax authorities must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the expiry of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxpayer, the taxation period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, tax payers must submit their prior declarations no later than 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer may correct the errors in the monthly advance declarations by filing a single VAT return;
— if the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the adjustment cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the CM;
— The Länder do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual sales tax declarations have been processed.
According to registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This tax obligation enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the sales ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the competent FA may reconcile the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only verify the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return submitted.
In contrast to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are required to submit the advance VAT declaration electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit the tax return electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary Messages
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 102 of Law No 235/2004, an entrepreneur delivering goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes shall submit corresponding summary declarations (hereinafter referred to as “ZM”).
The value of the goods delivered shall always be indicated in the currency of the Czech currency, broken down by VAT number 7, the individual taxpayer under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
Tax persons with a calendar month or quarterly tax period shall submit the ZM to the local competent FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data shall be corrected within 15 days of the finding of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, tax payers can also submit the ZM electronically.
If a taxpayer does not issue a ZM or correction, even though he is required to do so in accordance with Law No 235/2004, the tax officer shall ask him to submit the relevant ZM and assign it to the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-monetary obligations, the financial officer is entitled to repeatedly impose fines up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No 337/1992.
In its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄs generally did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax officers.
In particular, when submitting the ZM, the taxpayers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfill their obligations, since the failure to submit a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Law No 235/2004, the financial officer is required to verify the information in the ZM or corrective ZM, to remove any ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of mismatch
8 of the information in the CM with which The Tax Permit corrects incorrect information in the CM by submitting a correction IMM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The financial officer shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
— the taxpayer does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ATM (or correction) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction IM,
— the financial officer has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ATM or correction ATM.
Adjustments entered by the tax officer, without the filing of a correction by the taxpayer, do not replace the duty of the taxpayer to submit a correction, but only result in the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that these are current, complete and accurate.
Data from the ZM shall be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive such data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The “O_MCTL” message is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect VAT IDs that were specified in the submitted CM lines.
If the incorrect VAT ID number is used in some of the submitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the incorrect VAT ID number.
The list contains a “notification of doubts concerning VAT number”.
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the verification into the system.
In the case of purchase of goods from another Member State, the taxpayer shall indicate this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return for that purpose.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisitions made by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and the values specified by the supplier from the other Member State for the delivery of goods in his VAT return shall be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for verification.
The specialists there have to examine the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
(a) The value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the supplies indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer shall verify the accuracy of the information.
(b) The difference is zero.
This situation may arise either by changing the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or by changing the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax person makes a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
(c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return is higher than the values of their deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer shall enter the results of his review in ATIS.
These results are forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for review is shown for each quarter of 2005 in graph 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄs for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, inter alia, to the fact that the Czech CLO has increased the threshold for a case selection taking into account the minimum limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between VAT returns and EC data do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic acquirer.
There may also be a defect by the taxpayer in another Member State, or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the CM are indicated differently in each EC Member State.
The most common reasons for discrepancies in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FAs are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of the summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must surrender ZM quarterly in which intra-Community deliveries are listed by acquirer (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter.
If a term extension is granted for the filing of pre-VAT declarations, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be given to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been obligatory.
The competent FA may allow exemptions for individual tax purposes in order to avoid undue hardships.
If the taxpayer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is required to submit a correction payment within one month.
If the ZM is not delivered, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: — first reminder — second reminder, coupled with the threat of a penalty payment being fixed and — fixing the periodic penalty payment.
Although the German Tax Code allows the establishment of a periodic penalty payment of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO establishes periodic penalty payments in the amounts of €125, €250 and €500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 of the UStG stipulates that the taxpayer acts in violation of the order if he intentionally or recklessly does not issue a ZM correctly, not in full or in due time, or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This infringement can be punished by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the FEE because the CLO is responsible for processing the ZM.
The data of the ZM is stored only with the CLO.
The data from the summary messages are only available to the FÄs after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID number in the ZM of German tax payers, the German CLO shall receive a message “O_MCTL” from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the correct data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the competent FA.
It is then his task to request the correct information.
In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID number at the request of the CLO.
However, the memory and the threat and fixing of up to three consecutive penalty payments takes too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases which were ultimately reported to the competent FEE were usually closed within one to two months.
The competent FA refused the exemption for the declared intra-Community supplies in 73% of these cases9.
If the tax officer provided the correct VAT ID number, the FA requested him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FEs cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The Federal Republic of Germany found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the supply of the adjusted ZM.
That is why the taxpayers often did not comply with the call. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, the information provided in the VAT filings or in the VAT return will not be reconciled with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This reconciliation can only be done by the FEE. This is usually done when preparing a special VAT check.
Data received from other Member States shall be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID number shall be detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used to control acquisition taxation in the FÄs.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO matches the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications shall be drawn up and transmitted to the competent TEFs.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT payers is later created and forwarded to the FÄs.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then matches those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully checks (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a ZM to the local competent FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FEs process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxpayers in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The results of the reconciliation are taken into account in the context of tax fixing.
In Germany, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to supply quarterly CM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, tax payers have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
Data from the ZM are only available to the FÄs after their processing at the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, tax payers indicate only the deliveries of goods in the ZM.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄs, the German FÄs are not able to correct incorrect information in individual lines of the issued ZM themselves.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID number was not corrected even if the tax person provided the correct VAT ID number to the FA.
The German Financial Administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxpayers in their advance VAT declarations with the information provided by the relevant ZM.
Differences between the pre-notification data and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
The data provided by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech taxpayers are compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchase of goods indicated by the Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO performs the reconciliation separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations are sent to the FÄs for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general check is carried out only for taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxpayers if the RMS has issued an audit note or if the taxpayer has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves FÄs from clarifying the reasons for differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that can be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxpayers had to issue monthly TMs.
The monthly levy would only negligible increase the bureaucratic burden, since most tax payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-registrations anyway and no more information is required for ZM than for VAT returns or — pre-registration.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the filing of VAT declarations or pre-declarations.
However, a monthly payment of ZM would create more periodic discrepancies between intra-Community deliveries and intra-Community acquisitions, and would increase the flow of data between the CLO.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the Länder.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to issue a monthly fee to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on deliveries of goods and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both Court of Auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT number in the O_MCTL reports exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual quarterly audited.
These data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O_McTL was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information enables financial officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxpayers who have carried out them.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of surplus value tax, which repeals Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as “Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003”) distinguishes between two basic ways of exchanging information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous Exchange of information (without prior request).
International exchange of information upon request shall be carried out by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standardised SCAC form.
Financial officers in the Czech Republic send their RFIs or their replies to a received RFI to the CLO through the Financial Directorate. The latter shall ensure that the information provided in the standardised SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and that it is forwarded to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It takes care of their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FÄs for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a period not exceeding three months from the date of receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period under review were verified by the NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ examination. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests submitted by Germany were replied by the Czech Republic can be found in graph 2.
From the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases there was no reply from the NKÚ examination. Germany (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine when Germany replied to the request for information on the basis of the declared information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were replied can be found in Graph 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover reported in requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graph 4.
The above graph shows that the turnover checked in connection with requests for information usually had values of over €60,000.
International exchange of information without prior request shall be either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officers of other Member States are often provided with information that is important for the determination of VAT liability without prior request.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between Member States shall be carried out electronically.
“automatic exchange” in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of previously established information to other Member States at regular predetermined intervals without prior request.
“structured automatic exchange” means the systematic transmission of previously established information to another Member State without prior request as soon as the information concerned is available.
The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States of the supply of new vehicles by means of automatic exchanges of information.
This information is obtained by the financial officer from the form “Notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer shall enter the required data into the relevant document template and forward it directly to the responsible employee of the Finance Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, these data shall be transmitted to the other Member States within the prescribed time limit, namely no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic shall also provide to the other Member States information on transactions in the mail order trade which are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions which appear inadmissible and on potential “missing traders”.
This information shall be communicated to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information is based on the local FA.
The FÄs send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄs are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is a single language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the Federal Republic of Germany were submitted in order to ensure the taxation of taxation in the other Member State or to demonstrate the exemption of intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check whether the value of the deliveries referred to in the request exceeds the minimum limit of €15,000.
If there is no reasonable justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or English.
In order to respond to the request for information, the CLO shall forward it to the competent FA, referring to the three-month period.
There are no further deadlines at the different levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor the deadlines, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄs of responding to the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄs receive the necessary information by means of a cover letter from the tax person or by carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT lookup, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
This short and flexible form of examination does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proven itself in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany shall provide the other Member State with the following information: — by VAT number allocated to undertakings established in other EC Member States — on the refund of input tax to entrepreneurs resident in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC Member States as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. The supply of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT number, b. distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the acquisitions reported by a taxpayer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community supplies of goods which were incorrectly subject to taxation by the taxpayer in Germany, e. potential “missing traders” which have made intra-Community transactions, irrespective of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, and for tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential “missing traders” or to customers who have misused a VAT ID number.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the local authorities who send the relevant SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information into English or German, the German authorities follow the instructions to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany for the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech Financial Administration completed 74,5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information sent to Germany were received from the German financial administration only in 40.6% of cases within this period.
Although the German CLO warns the FÄs of the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of requests for information received in due time.
That is why the BRH recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the financial offices of responding to the pending requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial administration are involved in risk management in the field of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organizational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of VAT, or its Risk Management Unit, deals with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the “credibility of VAT returns” criterion and uses the MIAS data to identify possible tax evasions in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the balance of trade in the Czech Republic, it evaluates goods that are subject to risk, prepares conceptually for risk management in the field of turnover tax and cooperates in this field with the relevant EC bodies and the other Member States.
The Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, provides public relations and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance. administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The Department of Tax Audit and Tax Detection, among other things, carries out risk analyses within the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and collects in in this context, information from the financial administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax search offices exist with the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax payers and sectors that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax agents (e.g. in the Internet services, employment agencies, electronic and print media, etc .), the investigation of transactions in the case of chain fraud and the information to the local tax authorities.
Special examination units were set up in 12 selected FEs.
They have regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits also outside the local jurisdiction of the FÄs.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in identified new and “improved” forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of the tax investigators or focus on tax payers with certain activities, multinational companies and tax payers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT were integrated into the ATIS system: — the “credibility of VAT returns” task for assessing the risk risk of issued tax returns, — the task “Selection of taxpayers to be checked”, whereby the taxpayers to be checked — the “MIAS” task, which provides financial officials with access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The “MIAS” task allows, inter alia, to: — to verify the validity of the VAT ID number of taxpayers from other Member States; — to confirm the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax person as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the tax person concerned from other Member States; — compilation of a list of taxpayers who did not provide VAT, — formal control of the information provided by taxpayers in the Czech Republic in their Member States before such information is communicated to other Member States; — compilation of a list of taxpayers in whose VAT returns the information on: Deliveries of goods to other Member States do not match the information contained in the ZM; — compilation of a list of taxpayers in whose VAT returns the information on the value of the goods purchased from other Member States does not match the information in the ZM of all their suppliers from other Member States13.
As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, financial officers have access to the data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registry, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
In the Federal Republic of Germany, both the Federal Financial Authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 Länder are involved in the development and implementation of an RMS.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the Länder have a complete set of data.
At the level of the CLO, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as “KISS” — Coordination Unit for Special Tax Audit and Tax Detection Measures) collects the findings of fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was established at the KISS. There, the financial authorities can enter and query the names of detected missing traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KISS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experience of the KISS is contributed to the development of the RMS through their cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal verification of the composition of VAT number of other Member States appearing in the ZM of German tax payers is carried out at the CLO.
This formal review shall be carried out prior to transmission of the VM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of MIAS data and, consequently, its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The verification of the validity of the VAT ID number referred to in the CM shall be carried out on the basis of the O_MCTL identifiers provided by the other Member States (for the correction procedure, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS relies on MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications to detect suspected missing traders. As indications, certain features are used, which, as a rule, occur in carousel shops.
The FÄs of the Länder are instructed to process these communications and must, in certain cases, forward the results of their investigations to the CLO.
The examination by the BRH confirmed that all available features must be included in order to reasonably conclude a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).
Accordingly, the BRH recommended the BMF to work with combinations of different indications when preparing the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the industry or the company's equity.
A second level of risk management exists at the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of pre-sales tax declarations and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of those tax payers who have specified intra-Community deliveries in their VAT notification or annual declaration.
This list shall be sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete submission of the ZM.
In addition, this type of risk management compares the acquisitions specified by the tax person in his annual VAT return with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the Länder avoid comparing quarterly data, as these would result in too many disagreements due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
— the supplier and the purchaser assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community turnover;
— different accounting and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many Länder have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of owners/partners, number of employees and method of payment of the Tax persuasive).
Bayern has introduced a risk-management system based on fixed rules that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter “risk managers”) to program their own rules in such a way that alleged tax fraudsters are identified.
This system is used when processing the VAT filings by the use of the VAT.
As a result, the competent FA receives the information from the RMS before the VAT is fixed.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FEE.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of revealed cases of evasion.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system shall draw up a monthly list of tax cases where there are indications of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FEs shall decide on the examination of the tax authorities concerned.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on many data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the data mining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is entangled in tax fraud.
After that, it creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
Based on this list, the FEs select the relevant tax authorities for review and report the test results to the data center concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is in progress in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems to be effective.
Whether the expected effects will occur during actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German Länder, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud — particularly carousel fraud — has proved to be a European problem, not a national problem.
The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this is not done, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their offences.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales In parallel audits, the NKÚ and the BRH investigated the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or deliveries.
which were the subject of international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two Court of Auditors jointly examined the settlement of several deliveries, which were doubted about the implementation, or which the tax authorities of both countries declared differently in the tax returns or in the ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax payers.
In addition, in 43 cases on the basis of communications from the BRH, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany which Czech tax payers had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax payers.
The relevant information was exchanged solely on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.
Examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different procedures of registration in the EC Member States lead to the problems referred to in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €60,500 from a German taxable person.
When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech Financial Administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to verify the value of the goods delivered.
The German side stated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German tax agent concerned had delivered goods worth €27,381 to its Czech counterparty in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
The answer also revealed that the VAT ID number of the German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had accepted a further application by the German tax agent and moved the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax victor corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was an (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech tax agent.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech taxpayer had submitted supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under year) taxation periods in which he declared a higher value of acquisitions from other Member States, and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from acquisitions from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible specialist of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared acquisitions included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
He did not apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number when registering, but only a tax number valid exclusively for Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to assign a VAT ID number retroactively to a taxpayer, the responsible specialist of the German financial administration did this in 2006 retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the tax holder's request to issue a VAT ID number.
In this case, the CLO issues the VAT ID number retroactively because the entrepreneur does not need a valid VAT ID number for an intra-community delivery in accordance with § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of his supplier to explain the intra-Community acquisition.
Due to these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT ID number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial officer requested the verification of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities indicated that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons it had not been granted a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005.
By requesting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ learned that the tax officer had carried out a VAT audit with the Czech tax officer for the taxation periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
In this audit, the tax office found that the Czech tax person in his VAT return declared services worth CZK 9,897, which he had provided to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office fixed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 against the Czech tax person for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the request of the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German tax holder had not been granted the VAT ID number until he notified his company, which was founded in 2004 to the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxpayer indicated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160€(approx. 5,000 CZK).
3. In its sales tax return for September 2004 and in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax subject.
When checking the registration of the German tax officer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax officer found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after deliveries to Germany.
The Czech taxpayer issued a supplementary VAT return declaring transactions from domestic supplies worth CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777.
By requesting the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted an application for the resumption of the taxation procedure in matters of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German financial administration that the German tax payer had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax officer verified the validity of the registration of the German tax officer in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to German information, it was found that the German tax person had only been assigned a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech financial officer dismissed the request to resume the taxation procedure.
The BRH noted that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German tax victor had only received a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and VAT and also demanded the reimbursement of input taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax officer did not correct the information in the VAT return.
In addition, the BRH found that the company of the German taxpayer referred to in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in confusion between two German tax persons.
This change in the name of the German tax officer also confused the Czech financial officer.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax officer reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech tax officer in the first quarter of 2005 from a German tax officer valued at €22,686.
In a request from the local competent tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer had investigated whether the intra-Community supply had actually been carried out and whether the Czech tax officer received the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxpayer did not explain the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxpayer is only registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions from 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech tax officer also requested that the German tax authorities send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax officer so that he could initiate a corresponding taxation procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set VAT on the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The Federal Republic of Germany found that under German law, a taxpayer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such delivery.
The supplier must only have the VAT number of the acquirer in the other Member State and can prove the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.
In this case, according to German tax law, turnover is an intra-Community (exempt) supply which should be subject to acquisition taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if these are below the minimum threshold of €15,000:5.
According to MIAS data, a Czech tax payer acquired goods worth €12,561 from a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech tax officer carried out an audit for this tax period.
Within the framework of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech Financial Administration requested the verification of this supply of goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he did not receive the product, had never been in business with the German company and that he did not register the purchase of the goods in question.
The German Finance Administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents — contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents — because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
As the Czech tax officer did not receive any documents for retrospective taxation of the goods purchased, the tax inspection remained unsuccessful and the original tax fixing was in place.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the Federal Republic of Germany found that the German tax agent acted as “fiscal representative17” (§ 22 (a) — (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the replies of the German Finance Administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month deadline more frequently than the replies of the Czech Financial Administration:
6. In its audit, the NKÚ found that the Czech Financial Administration had submitted a request for information on the value of deliveries to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax agent had reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax agent worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax agent declared in his VAT return only the purchase of goods worth €35,314 for the same period.
In the reply to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side indicated that the request for information could not be processed as the German company dissolved at the end of 2005. has been.
Because the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official requested the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax officer worth €1,265,554, carried out in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ found that at the time of its examination a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request from the local tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer had not declared the supply of new motor vehicles to this German tax holder in the value of CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech tax officer corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax officer issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out at the German purchaser in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all the vehicles concerned had been properly taxed and that the vehicles were resold to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. According to MIAS data, the Czech tax payer acquired a car worth €48,500 from a German tax payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By requesting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax holder had not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax officer did not make any tax returns even when requested by the tax officer. As a result, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero on 23 May 2005.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction for the examination of the abovementioned delivery by the German tax authority.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the tax officer, he made a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known, until the completion of the NKÚ audit, how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained from the international exchange of information.
Due to non-fulfilment of the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax agent was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial response was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial officer requested a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax officer worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax officer stated that he had only the invoices for deliveries of €16,335 issued by the Czech tax officer.
On the basis of the request of the NKÚ, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed at the acquirer in Germany.
The German purchaser declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in his advance VAT declarations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax officer requested a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax officer valued at €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, with signs of carousel fraud.
The German Finance Administration submitted a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic confirming that the German tax agent had acquired several vehicles and that the investigation in Germany was not yet completed.
The NKÚ noted that the local FA had carried out several external audits at the Czech tax officer in order to verify the deduction of excess taxes.
However, an unjustified claim was not established.
The Federal Republic of Germany found that the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States for a total value of €579,114 for the period in question, and that the examination of the German FA at the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for disagreement between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's PM.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodic disagreements or the incorrect declaration of turnover as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech tax agent purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German tax agent; however, the Czech tax agent did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the tax officer and no business took place at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech tax officer asked for a review as part of the international exchange of information how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech tax officer.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German Financial Administration, the Czech tax holder was unknown at the given address and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax payer only supplied goods worth €21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German tax person a false payment confirmation for the amount of 155,153 €in favor of the German tax person.
After revealing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer managed to recover the delivered material with the exception of one part worth €7,916 with the support of his other Czech customers.
In a request from the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the tax authorities subsequently applied the turnover taxation of goods from other Member States amounting to CZK 388,522 on the basis of the information received to the Czech tax holder.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that after adjustments the German supplier had only reported a shipment of goods to the Czech tax holder worth €7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax payer explained the cancellation of the supply and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the verification of a supply of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCAC form.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had delivered goods to the German tax liable for a total value of 396,126 €and provided services worth 11,885 €.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax authority had carried out an audit with the Czech tax administrator to investigate this supply.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax authorities indicated that the Czech tax holder had supplied and installed a production plant to the German.
The Czech tax holder supplied the individual parts of the production plant prior to the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was installed on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax victor did not take down the assembled production plant and claimed deficiencies.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax payer charged the German production facility for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the invoices, but did not recognize them and did not pay them either.
By requesting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices had been duly recorded in the accounts of the Czech tax holder.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech tax holder and related to invoices invoiced after May 1, 2004.
The Federal Republic of Germany found that the competent local FA concluded on the basis of the reply from the Czech Financial Administration that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax officer to the German, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is installed.
The German service recipient of the work delivery shall owe the value added tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient may claim a deduction of the same amount.
Since the tax liability of the German taxpayer remained unchanged, the German FA did not make any correction to the VAT return.
13. According to MIAS data, the Czech tax payer A acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax payer C.
The Czech tax officer sent a request to Germany for verification of this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side indicated that the German tax payer C delivered this machine to the Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but who had returned it to the German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the German Financial Administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German Tax Officer C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German tax payer C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax payer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German tax representative's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) was only carried out within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
By requesting the local tax officer responsible for tax officer B, the NKÚ found that, according to MIAS data, the German tax agent C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
Taxer B stated that he did not receive this product, so that the local Czech tax officer sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigation with taxpayer B, the tax officer found that the machine, worth €88,027, had not been registered with taxpayer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the German tax officer C's branch in February 2005 to the Czech tax agent A had delivered.
The NKÚ also found that the Czech tax officer responsible for tax agent A had carried out an audit on the latter.
The tax officer had the invoice of the German tax officer C dated February 7, 2005, in which the taxpayer A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax officer noted that taxpayer A had not accounted for this account.
Tax agent A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasingﬁrma delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of taxpayer A.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine worth 88,027 €not to the Czech Republic but to another German tax person D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods, but a tax-free delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German financial officer did not recognize the entitlement of the German tax subject C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German tax victor D delivered the machine to the Czech tax victor B.
According to German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH further noted that the German tax payer C had indicated the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax person A in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005.
This delivery was not verified during the tax inspection carried out by the German FA.
The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the counterparties involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that the Czech Financial Administration had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which a German tax officer had to verify intra-Community deliveries of a German tax officer valued at €879,680,625 to a Czech He asked for a tax man.
The German tax officer stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.
The German taxpayer had not engaged in active business since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax officer.
The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim of the German tax holder vis-à-vis the German tax administration, which the Czech tax holder had asserted as a shareholder in the German company at the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax officer has so far no information that the German tax authority is handling the case with reference to the Czech tax officer.
The information available shows that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community supply of goods from Germany to a Czech tax person.
The main reason for these disagreements was the omission of the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the beneficiaries (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to MIAS data, a German tax payer delivered a total value of €33,205 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not explain intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech tax officer requested an examination of the supply of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had dispatched part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the other goods were collected personally.
By requesting the local competent Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period concerned prior to receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech tax officer.
This check has not yet been carried out.
16. According to MIAS data, a German tax payer had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for verification of the actual value of the supply.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent, representing a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax holder and the MIAS data.
By requesting the local competent Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that, after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax officer and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, together with the company owner, she asked for the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004 wanted to talk.
Until now, no supplementary VAT returns have been submitted.
The Czech tax officer informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way as to respect the time limits for retroactive VAT fixing for the relevant taxation period.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxable goods amounting to €11,600 were delivered to the German taxpayer.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax officer asked to verify whether the above Czech tax authorities actually existed, since the alleged shareholder of the German tax holder had established a number of sham figures in Germany.
In the course of the verification of the transaction by the FA, the Czech tax victor confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech taxpayer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer provided evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax person was not registered as VAT in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the product in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts indicated tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax officer provided this information in his reply to the request for information to the German financial administration.
By asking the local competent Czech tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax officer had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 following a tax audit, declaring, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax agent. and at the same time invoked the right to deduct VAT for the acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not register VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax officer fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech law, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States since the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax officer drew a wrong conclusion in the external audit.
The Federal Republic of Germany found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax officer corrected the tax return of the German tax officer and demanded the payment of VAT worth €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notification to the FA responsible for the actual consignee of the goods to ensure that the resale of those goods is duly taxed.
Traders declared intra-Community supplies that may not have been carried out in the following cases:
18.
The Czech tax officer received a request for information from the German tax authorities on whether the Czech tax officer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German tax officer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by an annex of the VAT registration certificate issued by the Czech tax authority.
A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was attached as a further attachment.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax officer found that the passport was stolen, that the person referred to therein had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and claimed that he had no contact with a German tax officer.
The VAT registration certificate, whose imprint was sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech Tax Administration.
With this information, the Czech financial officer replied to the request for information and at the same time declared that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By requesting the local competent Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax holder is not registered at the address indicated in the Commercial Register and that the company's managing director is not reachable.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the taxation period February 2005, the Czech tax officer fixed the tax liability of the Czech tax officer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it on the basis of an Internet ad.
The Federal Republic of Germany found that the local German tax officer refused the German tax officer's right to exempt this supply from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax victor should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax victor in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax officer did not coincide with the MIAS data, the German tax officer requested the verification of the deliveries and their payment within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech financial officer stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumed to be a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax officer issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely that shareholder of the company, following the cancellation of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech tax officer informed the tax officer that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the goods invoiced into the company's account in euros.
Cash documents have not been issued.
By requesting the local competent Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax officer recognised the Czech tax holder's entitlement to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States in the value of CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax officer did not correct the German acquirer's VAT return, since a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit showed no evidence of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to levy a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to MIAS data, a German tax payer acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not explain the intra-Community acquisitions either in his 2004 VAT return or in the 2005 sales tax return.
In addition, it did not explain the value of initial sales.
Due to these disagreements, the German FA made a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods totalling CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, asking the German side to check whether the delivery notified by the Czech tax inspector had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech Finance Administration stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company does not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
The documents provided to NKÚ by the competent financial officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax officer, a protocol on the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005 had been drawn up on 30 March 2006.
At the same time, the tax officer was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without appointing a new managing director.
Since April 2006, the Czech tax payer has ceased to issue VAT returns.
In the context of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community supplies between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not subject to prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two Court of Auditors exchanged information on the cases examined via the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct tax-related transactions in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) to produce wind turbines and deliver them to Austria in the name, on the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax victor (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
— The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Due to the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the supply of wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
— Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in his own name, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as liable to tax in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the supply of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the supply was intended is another as the registered state of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport began.
However, some wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
— The supply of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
— The supply of the other wind turbines produced in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH noted that the Czech company (UCR) did not explain intra-Community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries in a uniform manner as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ noted that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion in this case.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined cases in order to identify the size of the differences caused by the different legislation in 2004 between the data in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the tax authorities and the FEs to apply the new statutory provisions:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods totalling CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax subject.
During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-Community deliveries to another German taxpayer in his ZM for a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases they were supplies of electricity.
Both Czech tax payers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with the Czech Law No 235/2004 in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 there were different legal provisions on the supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Whereas in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the supplies of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition under the German legal provisions in force in 2004. of goods, but about taxable and taxable sales in Germany.
The differences in legal regulations were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. In the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further found that a Czech taxpayer in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 intra-Community deliveries to a German tax person totalling CZK 240,411,163 and another for the same period the Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community deliveries to another German taxpayer worth CZK 263,470,776.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases they were supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No 235/2004, applicable from 1 January 2005, in the case of supply of electrical energy, the place of performance shall be the place where the acquirer has his legal seat, place of business or place of business for which the delivery is made.
Therefore, the Czech tax authorities should not have indicated the supply of electricity in their 2005 ZM.
The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies resulted in an amount difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Conclusion
The cooperation achieved the goals of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the statutory provisions applicable to VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions were found.
Some of them are worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both auditors developed recommendations on the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the further observation.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both auditors is the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the field of VAT administration.
