Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasizes that SAIs are empowered to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the courts of auditors have the power to audit tax collection as much as possible.
The Organization of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) regards taxes as a significant component of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the VI. EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the SAIs.
One of the most important steps towards optimizing the audit work of an ACA is the development of a specific public revenue audit strategy.
This is especially true of taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high default risk.
As national economies become increasingly interdependent and interdependent, a situation may arise in which SAIs can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit offices of other countries.
One example is the audit of internationally organized fraud, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many countries.
Combating such crimes requires cooperation between the authorities.
SAIs auditing in this area must be willing to work closely together.
The idea for an audit of the VAT and the system MIAS is the VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This review was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Audit.
In the course of a thorough preparation, the participating audit offices first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the evaluation of the available information, we selected the audit subjects for the audit planning.
Achieving effective and effective VAT administration is a long-standing problem, and individual countries (in particular EC Member States) are seeking solutions to improve the system, simplify VAT collection and increase transparency in this area.
We believe that the results of our audit not only help to improve the work of financial management, but can also provide the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international information exchange.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
introduction
Reference: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject matter:
(CZ) VAT administration following the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(EN) Review of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
the Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic in the common market of the European Community (hereinafter "the EC") with free movement of goods and services and the Use of VIES1, in particular the control of the use of VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(EN) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control, with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, in accordance with the abovementioned Regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations for remedying them should be made.
VAT information exchange system The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKÚ") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany pursuant to an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information gained through international administrative assistance between the tax administrations and the comparison of the VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No 31 on the implementation of INTOSAI auditing standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel VAT audit in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two audit offices.
In addition to the focus on 'exchanges of information' under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004, other closely related issues were also examined, such as the registration of taxpayers, tax declarations and summary statements.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation of cross-border passenger transport by coach and bus and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the level of their turnover, in the Czech Republic among others the essential criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold laid down in the turnover tax law.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only one single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, for tax purposes, the taxpayer receives a tax number that applies only to domestic sales.
If German taxpayers require intra-Community sales, they must apply for the issuance of a special identi fi cation number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonized within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by coach and bus.
In the Czech Republic, the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduct input VAT.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to standardize the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover tax (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic the taxable sales tax returns have to be submitted only for tax periods of less than one year (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Sales tax pre-registration and after the end of the calendar year to submit a VAT return.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany have to hand in VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit electronic VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax authorities (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic are required to submit their summary reports to the tax offices (FÄ), German taxpayers are required to hand in summary summaries to the CLO2.
Correspondingly, FÄ data in the Czech Republic are available as soon as they are submitted in the Summary Reports.
German FÄ the information in the summary reports is only available after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions will be needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the date of the transaction and the update of the VIES data.
This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
For detailed requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German tax authorities have dealt with a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the prescribed deadline.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended the German CLO to constantly monitor deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS can not be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS need to be shared and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, the two SAIs audited selected cases of intra-Community transactions implemented between Czech and German taxpayers.
Of these, 31 cases were reviewed together using the CLO's legal options, which raised doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The SAIs stated:
In some cases the FÄU used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxpayers concerned.
In those cases, taxpayers either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not declare the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FACs could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be recovered due to divergent legislation in the two Member States.
In some cases, the tax authorities of another Member State refused the requested information.
A number of cases were identified in which taxpayers indicated inaccurate sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the VIES was correspondingly incorrect, so the clerks (the FÄ) had to identify in these cases (see 6).
examination procedure
Examination procedure in the CR
The audit was carried out in the period June 2006 to March 2007 by the Department II - "State budget revenue" and the territorial audit departments Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
Audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of NKÚ approved the findings on April 23, 2007.
Examination procedure in Germany
The audit was carried out in the period from July 2006 to February 2007 by the taxation area and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test started in the 4th quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the test in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and in the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following FÄ were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe city, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg North and Hamburg for large enterprises, Hanover north, Winsen Luhe, Bonn center, Cologne center, Cologne Porz, Cologne south, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz south, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau ,
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Augsburg city, Aurich, Dusseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the audit were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
In the run-up to the parallel examination, several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors took place.
The participants in these meetings became familiar with the organization of the financial administration, the VAT legislation and the system of VAT administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the follow - up procedure was developed and the following audit topics were identified for the parallel audits: 1.
Registration of taxpayers.
Second
Cross-border passenger transport by coach and bus - Legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the actions of financial officials in the processing of requests for information and the examination of selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5th
Summary messages.
6th
Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the VAT area.
At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel examinations already achieved.

An entrepreneur with legal domicile, place of business or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 for the last 12 consecutive calendar months, shall become the first day of the third month following the month in which he exceeded the threshold , liable to pay (section 94 (1) of Law No 235/2004 Coll., on turnover tax, hereinafter referred to as "Law No 235/2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retrospective registration of a taxpayer who has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, place of business or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides VAT-related services or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million; but fulfills other conditions specified in Law No 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with legal domicile, place of business or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not fulfill any of the conditions stated in the law, can voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
Upon receipt of the registration application with the local tax office, the registration procedure under Law No. 337/1992 begins.
Anyone wishing to register for VAT voluntarily must indicate in his application the key date from which he applies for registration as a VAT payer.
The tax collector must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, ie the completed application for registration with all attachments.
If he has doubts about the information provided, he must request the applicant to explain, complete or substantiate the information provided.
If the tax collector has determined by verification that the entrepreneur fulfills the requirements for registration, he must give a written notification of the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the notification, the taxman must indicate the date of entry into force of the VAT registration and the VAT assessment period.
Assessment period is the calendar quarter; unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must notify the tax collector of this change.
The issuing of a tax number in the registration notice always has constitutive character.
The taxpayer must provide the taxpayer's identification number with each communication (including payments) with the taxman, as well as in cases where a special law so requires (eg Law No 235/2004 on the filing of tax documents) 3.
The tax code contains the code "CZ" and a basic element in the form of a general identifier.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or any other general identification mark, as far as a special law so determines. For legal persons, the general identifier is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur fails to fulfill his obligation in spite of a request by the taxman, the locally responsible tax officer has to register him ex officio.
This will also be notified to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur admitted to a business receives a tax number for his first registration for any type of tax.
This also applies to the registration as a VAT payer.
Pursuant to Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-fulfillment of the obligation to register VAT, the taxman may require the taxable person to pay up to 10% of the taxable amount of the tax Unlawful without taxation for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxpayer to the date on which registration as a taxpayer was made by the taxman (Section 98 (1) of the Act No. 235/2004).
Payment of the amount so determined is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98 (3) of Law No 235/2004, ie it is not a fine or a fine.
If the legal prerequisites exist, the registration of a VAT payer can be canceled for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of the registration at the request of the taxpayer, ie mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No 235/2004).
A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) The ex officio deletion of the registration (Section 106 (7) of Law No 235/2004) if: (a) the taxpayer failed to provide services for a period of 12 consecutive months and did not inform the taxman of the reasons therefor, b ) the taxpayer did not fulfill its obligations under Law No. 235/2004, c) the former taxpayer no longer fulfilled the requirements for the tax liability.
B) Taxable persons having no legal seat, place of business or premises in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State and having no legal domicile, place of business or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic or a foreign taxable person established in the Czech Republic Czech Republic and, in accordance with Section 108 of Law No 235/2004, have to file a tax return for such services or deliveries and pay taxes ("non-resident entrepreneur") shall be liable to tax for the provision of the relevant service.
He must apply for registration at FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to include in this application all VAT IDs assigned to him in other Member States or third countries. specify.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than the day of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 shall register him retrospectively, as under Act No. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic was subject to VAT.
In the case of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require proof of performance from the contractors concerned (invoices or written explanations).
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, FA Prague 1 must request the submission of performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
Pursuant to Section 106 (9) of Law No 235/2004, the taxman is authorized to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if he has fulfilled his obligation to file tax returns or Statements and tax payment not accepted.
NKÚ's examination revealed that if a tax return was sent by post and sent abroad on 25th January, ie according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA by 31st January is.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than January 31, a cancellation of the non-resident entrepreneur's registration in the Czech Republic in the relevant country Calendar year no longer possible.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
According to the provisions of the tax code (§§ 137, 138 AO) every business enterprise must be registered with the municipality and / or the responsible tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business.
The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.
If the responsible tax office determines that a business has been started but has not been registered, it can also ex officio register the taxpayer retrospectively.
Regardless of whether they are domiciled or non-resident, taxable persons in Germany are required to register for VAT purposes if they fulfill the requirements of § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of sales generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
For foreign-based entrepreneurs special FÄ are responsible.
For example, the FA Chemnitz-Süd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of April 30, 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the company; As of March 1, 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to findings of the BRH, these FÄ with special responsibilities often denied the registration of so-called fictitious self-employed persons residing in the new Mittelbzw. Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still limited after the accession to the EC of these ten states, these self-employed workers tried to circumvent these restrictions by establishing their own business.
These (fake) self-employed persons do not meet the requirements for recognition as entrepreneurs as set out in § 2 of the UStG, as they are usually dependent on a single client, who determines their working hours and the type of work performed.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information on the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the general tax units.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual taxpayer before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The following three (or four) digits indicate which department within the FA is responsible. The following five (or four) digits are the identifier for the taxpayer who is the last digit always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he must, in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries, pay a VAT number.
This is allocated by the CLO upon application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT ID. is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT returns or in his annual VAT return.
The VAT ID. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On application (eg when he ceases to do business), but only after completion of all taxation transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. if the tax authority determines that he no longer operates a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT number depends. from the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases the FÄ must inform the CLO about the cancellation of the VAT number, so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be changed. can be ended at this time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay value added tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax did not exceed the amount of € 17,500 and 2. becomes the amount of 50,000 € probably do not exceed.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor to the deduction of input tax.
Although they do not have to pay sales tax, small businesses are required to register with the tax office and submit an annual VAT return.
A small business owner can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the next five years.
He may then invoice the sales tax and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive their input tax deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfills the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices must indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first condition for registration (among others) is the exceeding of the threshold amount mentioned in the turnover tax law.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of his registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community sales.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community sales, he must specifically allocate a VAT number. apply.
Both NKÚ and BRH found that the German two-tiered registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which provides a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community sales, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retrospective registration allows a correct assessment of value added tax for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.
As the different registration procedures cause problems, the rules should be harmonized throughout the EC.
The German Parliament has recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons residing in Germany for life.
If a natural person starts a business, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which is the VAT ID number. serves.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID. give.
Work on implementing an IT procedure for the management of numbers is ongoing.
Cross-border passenger transport by coach and bus
The legal requirements in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of Article 70 of Law No 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduct input tax.
The exemption from turnover tax applies even if the transport is carried out by persons who are registered as taxable persons in other Member States or are carried out by foreigners who are taxable domestically.
The return journey is considered as a separate transport operation.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out an economic activity other than the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus, they are not required to register as a taxable person in the Czech Republic.
Cross-border passenger transport was exempt from VAT in the Czech Republic under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The cited text states in the wording:
'For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, as provided for in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, maintain the exemption for international passenger transport until the condition laid down in Article 28 ( 4) of the Directive or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States. "
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented by § 3b (1) UStG in Germany, a transport service is carried out where the carriage is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and international passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.
Nor does German taxation distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxpayer travels through Germany, the part of the carriage accruing to Germany shall be considered as taxable carriage.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
It registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each registered motor coach in the registration of the taxpayer.
The entrepreneur must indicate his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of March 1, 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided to a resident entrepreneur, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is referred to as a "transfer of tax liability" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.
In addition to registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax authorities have several means of verifying the correctness of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:
Customs mobile control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad that are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each check, the mobile control groups submit an inspection record to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay the VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer may deduct the value added tax paid from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the correctness of a VAT return, it may order an audit to take place in the IA or may use the assistance provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally fixed value added tax, the IA may request mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT return or the compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too expensive in relation to the small amount of value added tax on personal passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the books of a non-resident taxpayer causes disproportionate costs for the taxpayer itself and for the tax authorities.
The latter has to check the foreign books, which requires not only the knowledge of the foreign language but also the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such a test can be expected to cost more time than a resident taxpayer, even though the test is limited to passenger transport in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must not only accept the audit rights of his national treasury, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which even a single passenger service is carried out, the taxable person must fulfill all existing tax obligations in the various languages and the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of international passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the distance covered by German national territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer furnishes such a transport service for the first time, he must first register this with the competent FA.
It registers the taxpayer, who must declare the taxable part of the transport service in a tax declaration in Germany.
The law enforcement in Germany is very time consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as their business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is relatively low in relation to the administrative burden.
The Member States - which charge VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of turnover taxes - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of VAT, cross-border passenger transport should be taxable only in one Member State.
This could be the state in which the promotion begins or in which the service provider is established.
Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Insofar as the law does not stipulate otherwise, even if no tax debt has been incurred, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit a VAT return on the form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the taxation period.
The tax liability arises on expiry of the deadline for the submission of the VAT return. Excluded from this regulation is, according to Act No. 235/2004, the value added tax on the importation of goods. Here the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
If, as a consequence of above-average deductible input tax, a claim for reimbursement arises, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of this deduction without the need for an application.
The time limit does not apply in cases where the taxman initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the taxpayer.
Pursuant to Section 73 (11) of Law No 235/2004, the right to deduct may be claimed at the latest with the regular tax return for the last taxable period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax was incurred.
After the expiry of that period, the deduction of input tax may still be made within three years of the end of the taxable period in which the claim could have been made for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Law No 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, permits the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the claim for deduction of input tax could have been asserted for the first time.
A taxpayer must submit a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the adjustments leads to an increase in the tax liability; (b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax liability, but only change previous information; § 49 of Law no. 235/2004 makes adjustments to the VAT rate and the tax liability.
A taxpayer may submit a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
The sales tax declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The delivery via the Internet can be done with a certi fi ed electronic signature or without it.
If it does not have an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carrier.
The VAT return form contains separate lines to indicate the value of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.
The value of purchased services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons who are registered as subject to taxation shall be compared with the data provided by the Czech taxpayers in their summary reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons subject to taxation there is compared, by means of the VIES, with the information in the summary statements of taxpayers from other EC Member States.
Under the ATIS system, FA carries out a credibility check of VAT returns.
This is done automatically because the VAT return can not be processed without the prior check.
The credibility check involves calculating the credibility standards and evaluating the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Law No. 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or decision under this Act ,
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support to tax collection.
During its audit, the NKÚ found that the FAO seldom made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the relevant taxpayer in the event of non-submission of the VAT return.
Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT returns and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are required to submit advance VAT returns must nevertheless submit an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not required to pay VAT must submit an annual VAT return.
The taxpayers are generally obligated to submit an advance sales tax return by the 10th day after expiry of the calendar quarter in which the value added tax arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).
In the previous year, however, if the VAT liability amounted to more than € 6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly advance VAT returns no later than the 10th day after the end of the respective month.
The taxpayer may also decide to submit monthly advance VAT returns if he has been reimbursed in the previous year for an amount of € 6,136 (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual sales tax does not exceed 512 €, neither VAT returns nor VAT returns are required.
A resulting VAT liability is payable 10 days after the end of the taxable period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the tax authorities.
(Legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German sales tax law allows for an extension of these (submission or payment) periods (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension must be requested separately.
If it is granted, submission of the advance VAT returns and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly reports, however, a special advance payment is required.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability determined for the pre-registration period December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT advance notice.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the VAT return to be submitted by May 31 of the following year has been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT advance notification, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Adjustments of this VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was submitted.
After expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually be corrected only in cases of trivial tax reduction or tax evasion.
Taxpayers must submit the VAT returns by electronic means.
The FÄ may grant exceptions to this rule to avoid undue hardship.
The annual sales tax return can be submitted either in hard copy or via the internet, with or without certi fi cation.
If the submission takes place without certi fi cation, the taxpayer must additionally submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT returns or declarations are submitted, the tax authorities are entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover generated by the taxpayer6.
In the event of late submission, the taxpayer may be charged a delay surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of € 25,000).
In a previous examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often did not charge this delay surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ charged late fees, the amount was set inconsistently and arbitrarily.
Therefore, the delay surcharge fails to reduce the average delay, in particular when submitting the annual VAT return.
The VAT return form contains separate lines for value data on intra-Community supplies or acquisitions.
Also for the purchase of services there are separate lines.
Non-taxable sales are to be indicated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The sales tax returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns are immediately available to the tax authorities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data has been electronically recorded, they undergo a risk management process and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk based on the automatically created test notes (see 5.2).
Although the tax authorities only have to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the taxable period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxpayer, the taxable period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers are required to submit their advance notifications no later than 10 days either at the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their previous year's tax liability.
The annual VAT return must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ At the end of the calendar year, the taxable person may correct the errors in the monthly advance notifications by submitting a single turnover tax return;
- If the taxable person corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the adjustment can not be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The Länder do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual VAT returns have been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs have to submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This duty of taxation enables the German tax authorities to check compliance with the minimum turnover threshold for small businesses.
In addition, the responsible IA may reconcile the annual VAT return with the corresponding statements for direct tax and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return submitted.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to submit their advance VAT return electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit electronic tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax authorities.
Summary messages
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of section 102 of Law No 235/2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State has to submit summary reports (hereinafter "CT").
The value of the goods supplied is always stated in the Czech currency in the Czech currency, broken down by VAT number 7, the individual taxpayer under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxpayers with a calendar month or quarterly taxable period must submit their statements to the local FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data shall be corrected in a correctional TS within 15 days of the detection of the error.
Erroneous data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
As in the case of tax declarations, the taxpayers can also remit ZM electronically.
If a taxpayer does not issue a CM or amending TSM, although he is required to do so under Law No 235/2004, the taxman must request him to pay the CM in question, pointing out the consequences of non-submission. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax office is authorized to repeatedly impose fines of up to CZK 2 million pursuant to Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992.
In its audit, the NKÚ found that the FAs did not usually use their power to impose fines on their defaulting taxpayers.
Taxpayers in particular are not sufficiently motivated to fulfill their duties in the case of the surrender of the ZM, since the failure to surrender a CM does not affect the amount of its VAT liability.
Pursuant to Section 102 (5) of Law No 235/2004, the taxman is required to review the information in the CM or the corrigendum, to remove any ambiguity and to use the information to establish the tax debt.
In case of mismatch
8 The information in the CM with which the taxpayer rectifies misstatements in the CM by submitting a correcting PM either on his own initiative or on request.
The taxman shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the CM (or amending TS) and therefore corrects it by issuing a correction TSM,
- the tax official has proved the incorrectness of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or the corrigendum of amendment.
The corrections entered by the taxman without the need for a corrigendum by the taxpayer do not replace the taxpayer's duty to submit a corrigendum but only correct the data in the VIES so that they are current, complete and accurate.
The data from the CM is forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of turnover tax may send and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The message "O_MCTL" is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect VAT IDs that have been specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT ID no. In some of the transmitted lines used by the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the wrong VAT number.
The list contains a "Doubt about VAT ID number."
The taxman checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must declare this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase on the relevant lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the value of purchases made by the Czech taxpayer in its VAT return and the values for delivery of goods stated by the supplier from the other Member State in its TS are forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The clerks there have to investigate the deviations.
There can be three different situations:
(a) the value declared by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the supplies indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the tax inspector verifies the accuracy of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation may arise either through a change in the information provided within the EC (the foreign supplier rectifies its CM) or by a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer in the meantime issues a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the taxman to check the accuracy of the VAT return.
(c) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech taxable person indicated in his turnover tax return, is higher than the values of their deliveries of goods reported by the suppliers of other EC Member States.
Again, it is at the discretion of the taxman to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the taxman enters the results of his review in ATIS.
These results are sent to the CLO.
The number of transactions submitted for review by the CLO is shown in graphs 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of Finance) for each quarter of 2005.
Chart 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, inter alia, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum threshold for a request for information to other EC Member States.
Differences between the data in the VAT returns and the data from the EC need not always be based on a mistake made by the domestic acquirer.
There may also be an error by the taxpayer in another Member State, or an error caused by different types of deliveries in the different EC Member States being indicated differently in the CM.
The most common reasons for discrepancies in the reported value of reported transactions in the audited FTE are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of the summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or who participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZMs listing intra-Community supplies to purchasers (Section 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.
If a long-term extension for the submission of the advance VAT returns is granted, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be submitted to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007 electronic filing has been obligatory.
The competent FA may allow for individual tax exemptions in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
If the taxpayer determines that the CM was defective, he is obliged to submit a correction CM within one month.
If the ZM does not surrender, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat of a penalty payment being imposed and - fixing of the periodic penalty.
Although the German tax code allows the establishment of a penalty of up to € 25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets in three stages penalty payments of 125, 250 and 500 €.
In addition, Section 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxpayer acts in an irregular manner if he willfully, inappropriately or incompletely fails to surrender a CM in time, or fails to do so in good time, or if he does not correct a CM in time or in a timely manner.
This violation can be punished with a fine of up to € 5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries can not be entered by the FÄ in the MIAS, because for the processing of the ZM exclusively the CLO is responsible.
The data of the ZM are only stored in the CLO.
The FÄ data are only available from the summary reports after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for the processing of CM are governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months after the relevant calendar quarter (in VIES).
In case of incorrect VAT number. the German CLO receives a message "O_MCTL" from the other Member State in the ZM German taxpayer.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the correct data.
If the CLO is unable to obtain the correct information, the case will be referred to the relevant FA.
It is then his job to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs the USt IdNr. corrected at the request of the CLO.
However, remembering and threatening and imposing up to three consecutive periodic penalty payments requires too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases ultimately reported to the competent FÄ were usually completed within one to two months.
The relevant FA refused the tax exemption for the reported intra-Community supplies in 73% of these cases9.
If the taxpayer set the correct VAT number. before, the FA asked him to hand over a corrected CM to the CLO because the FAOs can not correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the taxpayers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the VAT returns data, it does not reconcile the information provided in the VAT returns or sales tax returns with the corresponding information in the CM before it is transferred to the CLOs of the other Member States.
This adjustment can only be made by the FÄ. This usually happens when preparing a VAT special audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID. shall be identified and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data is used to control the acquisition tax in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If certain criteria (see 5.2) are met, control messages are produced and transmitted to the competent FTE.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a statement of the acquisition data of all VAT payer is created later and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment process then matches this data with those for intra-community acquisitions.
The system checks completely (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered in another Member State for VAT must, within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter, submit a TS to the local FA.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of the intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxpayers in the ZM are compared in the FÄ with the values of intra-Community deliveries stated by the same taxpayers in their VAT returns.
The results of the reconciliation are taken into account in the tax assessment.
In Germany, taxpayers who have made intra-Community supplies are required to submit quarterly CM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since January 1, 2007, the taxpayers must submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after processing with the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany taxpayers in the ZM only indicate deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German Fä can not correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT number was issued. not corrected even if the taxpayer has the correct VAT number. told the FA.
The German tax authorities do not reconcile the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxpayers in their advance VAT returns with the information provided by the corresponding taxpayer.
Differences between the dates of the pre-registration and the ZM are not regularly revealed before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.
On the basis of these BRH findings it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted VIES data.
Data on deliveries of goods to Czech taxpayers transmitted by other Member States are compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods which the Czech taxpayers indicated in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO will carry out the reconciliation separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the Fae for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities do not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control is only carried out for taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxpayers only if the RMS has issued a test notice or the taxpayer has been selected for an audit anyway.
This procedure relieves the FÄ of the clarification of the reasons for differences arising.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as soon as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular VIES, provides the tax authorities with information that can easily be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to as much as four months if taxpayers were to pay monthly CMs.
The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, as most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-registrations anyway and no more information is required for the taxpayer than for the VAT returns or pre-registrations.
To avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be linked to the filing of the VAT returns or pre-registrations.
However, a duty to pay ZM monthly would cause more periodic discrepancies between the data on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community acquisitions and increase the flow of data between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed because of the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that monthly forwarding of VIES data to the CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to pay monthly contributions to ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the single monthly fee at European level so that a monthly update of the VIES data is possible.
Statistical information on deliveries of goods and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT number. in the O_MCTL messages exchanged for the individual audited quarters between the Czech Republic and Germany.
These data are shown in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was issued, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O_MCTL reported.
International exchange of information at level 3
Carrying out international information exchange in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information enables tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxpayers who carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Council Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003) ) distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is made through a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
Tax Officers in the Czech Republic send their RFIs or their replies to the RFI received by the Finance Directorate to the CLO. It will ensure that the information provided in the standardized SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and forwarded to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and responses to requests sent. It handles their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a period of not more than three months from the date of receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFI exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany in the audited period were audited by the NKÚ.
Of the total of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (ie 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in another 23 cases (ie 24.5%) this processing time was exceeded.
In the remaining one case no reply had been sent to Germany until the examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Graph 2.
Out of the total of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, a response was received in 136 cases (ie 40.6%) within the three-month deadline; another 179 (ie 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this deadline, and in 19 cases no reply had yet been received from Germany by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case it could not be determined based on the information provided when Germany did so) Has answered your request for information).
More detailed information on the time limits within which requests for information from the Czech Republic have been answered from Germany can be found in Graph No. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community sales figures given in the request for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in graph no 4.
The above graph shows that the transactions audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of over € 60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
The tax officials of other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the value added tax liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
'Automatic exchange' under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
'Structured automatic exchange' means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to another Member State without its prior request, as soon as the information concerned is available.
The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on new vehicle supplies.
This information shall be obtained by the taxman from the declaration form relating to the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of Law No 235/2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the taxman enters the required data in the corresponding template and forwards it directly to the responsible member of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, these data shall be transmitted to the other Member States by the deadline given, at the latest, within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic shall also provide the other Member States with information on sales by mail order which are exempt from tax in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions which are inadmissible and on potential missing traders.
This information will be communicated to the other Member States via a SCAC form in the spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the local FA.
The FÄ will send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used SCAC form is monolingual.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were forwarded in order to ensure the acquisition tax in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of the intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check whether the value of the supplies referred to in the request exceeds the minimum threshold of € 15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO denies the information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these are neither in German nor in English.
To answer the request for information, the CLO forwards this to the competent FA, referring to the three-month deadline.
At the various levels of the German financial administration, no further deadlines are set.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with deadlines, it does not have the necessary staffing capacity to remind the FÄs to respond to pending requests for information.
The FÄ receives the required information by letter from the taxpayer or by carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audits: the VAT special audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called sales tax review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
With this short and fl exible form of examination, it is not necessary to make an announcement to the taxpayer and it has proved itself in the investigation of a single transaction.
In the case of an automatic exchange of information, Germany shall provide the other Member State with the following information: - via VAT registration numbers assigned to undertakings located in other EC Member States, - on the refund of input tax to traders established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany undertook to provide the other Member States with the following information in the context of structured automatic exchange of information:
a. The supply of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., B. Distance selling (mail-order) to other EC Member States not subject to VAT in Germany c. Significant discrepancies between the purchases reported by a taxpayer and the VIES data provided by other Member States; d. Intra-Community deliveries of goods which have been taxed by the taxpayer incorrectly in Germany, e. potential missing traders who have made intra-Community sales, regardless of whether their UStIdNr. is still valid or has already been deleted and f. Taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential missing traders or to customers who have a VAT ID number. have misused.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany at the initiative of the locally competent FÄ, who provide the SCO with the relevant SCAC forms.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC-forms (Czech-English) and translates information given into the English or German language, the German FÄ follow the instruction to request information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
In examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax authorities handled 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month deadline, while the requests for information sent to Germany by only 40.6% of cases were settled within this period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor compliance.
Due to the lack of reminders there is a high proportion of short-term requests for information.
Therefore, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a continuous reminder procedure.
The situation has changed in the meantime.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the tax authorities to answer the pending requests for information.
Sales tax risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial management deal with VAT risk management.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organizational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:
The Department of Value Added Tax Methodology and Economic Administration, or its Risk Management Unit, identifies potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the credibility of VAT returns criteria and uses the VIES data to detect possible tax evasion related to intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares conception of value-added tax risk management and cooperates with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States in this field.
The Department of International Assistance in the field of value added tax, among other things, exchanges of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the VIES system, provides outreach, and supports other forms of intergovernmental mutual assistance Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The tax audit and tax investigation methodology carries out, among other things, risk analysis as part of the methodological control of tax audits, sets priorities for the financial directorates' work schedules in selecting the cases to be audited, draws up risk analyzes to combat tax evasion and collects information from the tax audit Financial management and other sources, and make proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation agencies exist at the financial directorates. Its tasks include the search for taxpayers and industries which are risky in terms of tax avoidance (eg internet shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxpayers (eg in the internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.). ), investigating allegations of chain fraud and informing the local tax authorities.
Special exam units have been set up in 12 selected FÄ.
These have a regional responsibility and carry out tax audits beyond the local area of responsibility of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in perceived new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in relation to chain stores.
These special units examine the needs of the tax investigators or focus on taxpayers with specific activities, multinationals and taxpayers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing VAT risks have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk weight of tax returns, - the task "Selection of taxpayers to audit", with the taxpayers to be audited on the basis of certain tax - the "VIES" task, which gives the tax officials access to the data made available by other EC Member States.
The task "VIES" allows, among others, the following: - Verification of the validity of the VAT ID. of taxpayers from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of goods delivered to a Czech taxpayer, as indicated in the CM by all suppliers of the taxpayer concerned from other Member States, - compilation of a list of taxpayers who have not surrendered CM, - formal Checking the information that taxpayers in the Czech Republic have entered in their CM before submitting this information to other Member States; - Drawing up a list of taxpayers whose sales tax returns do not match the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States with the information in the CM - a list of taxpayers whose VAT returns do not agree with the information on the value of the goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated in the CM of all their suppliers from other Member States13.
As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, the tax officials have access to the data in state agencies such as commercial registers, land registry, motor vehicle registries, business registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Because of their federal structure, the Federal Republic of Germany involves both the Federal Finance Authorities (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 Länder in the development and introduction of an RMS.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the federal states have completely unified data.
At the level of the CLO, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - the coordination unit for turnover tax audits and tax investigations) collects audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the federal states KUSS established another database called ZAUBER. There, the tax offices can enter the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters and also query.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS by their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. Other Member States which appear German taxpayers in the ZM are carried out at the CLO.
This formal review will be carried out before transmission of the CM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (see 4.4.2).
The verification of validity in the ZM named VAT number. is based on the O_MCTL identifiers submitted by the other Member States (for the correction of invalid VAT IDs, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS of the CLO relies on the VIES data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of messages to detect suspected missing traders. As a guide, certain features are used, which usually occur in carousels.
The FÄ der Bundesländer are required to process these communications and, in certain cases, must forward the results of their investigations to the CLO.
The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features need to be included to make it sufficiently likely to detect a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing primarily on a company's sales).
Accordingly, the BRH recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different clues when preparing the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other factors, such as the payment behavior of the taxpayer, the economic activity or the ownership structure of the company.
A second level of risk management exists with the tax authorities of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT returns and annual statements.
For example, the system draws up a list of those taxpayers who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their advance VAT return or annual declaration.
This list will be sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete delivery of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases specified by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the VIES.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as these would lead to too many discrepancies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; eg:
- Supplier and purchaser assume different times for the execution of intra-Community sales;
- different accounting records and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to the comparison of VAT return data with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (eg company name, age of the owner / partner, number of employees and form of payment of the taxpayer) ,
Bavaria has implemented a fixed-risk risk management system that allows a team of anti-tax fraud specialists (hereafter "risk managers") to program their own rules to identify alleged tax evaders.
This system is used in the processing of VAT returns by the FÄ.
Thus, the competent FA receives the advice of the RMS before the sales tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers must adjust the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected cases of evasion.
Based on these data, the RMS is able to learn the features of tax evasion.
The system produces a monthly list of tax cases with evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FACs decide on the examination of the taxpayers concerned.
After the audit, the tax inspectors have to report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of their proposed examinations.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on many data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also known as the data-mining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.
After that, it creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, FACs select the taxpayers concerned for review and report the results of the audit to the data center concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is in progress in the federal states.
As each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.
Whether the actual effects will bring the expected effects remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to address the specific criteria of RMS in Czech and Germany, NKÚ and BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
At present, there is an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - in particular carousel fraud - has proved to be no national but European problem.
The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
One Member State alone can not develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS need to be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The loss of VAT caused by VAT fraud throughout Europe does not necessarily affect the Member State where the initiator is established.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
Therefore, there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual sales As part of the parallel tests, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and the usability of information on selected deliveries or
Acquisitions that were the subject of the international exchange of information between the tax authorities of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the execution of several deliveries which they had doubts about, or which differentiated the taxpayers of both states in the tax declarations or CM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ examined, on the basis of communications from the BRH, the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany which had indicated Czech taxpayers in their tax declarations and ZM.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases revealed, among other things, that the different procedures for registration in EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth € 60,500 from a German taxpayer.
When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only € 29,869, the Czech tax authorities sent a request for information to Germany to check the value of the goods supplied.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had goods worth € 27,381 in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth € 31,997 in the third quarter, and goods worth € 4,900 in the fourth quarter 10,276 € delivered.
Next came out of the answer that the VAT IdNr. German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German taxpayer and the validity of the VAT ID. with retroactive effect from 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information it was an (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
By requesting the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxpayers had submitted additional VAT returns in 2004 for the individual (sub-annual) tax periods in which they declared a higher value of acquisitions from other Member States and at the same time deducted the tax from input tax from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional sales tax returns, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office was unable to determine unequivocally whether the declared purchases included the value of the deliveries of the abovementioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as a VAT payer in September 2003.
However, when registering, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT number, but only for a tax number that applied exclusively to Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to pay a taxpayer retroactively a VAT ID number. In 2006, the responsible administrator of the German tax authorities did so with retroactive effect from 1 May 2004.
The German CLO shares a VAT number. retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; For example, if the CLO defers the delay after request of the taxpayer to issue a VAT ID. caused.
In this case, the CLO issues the VAT ID number. retroactive, because the entrepreneur does not have a valid VAT ID for intra-Community delivery under § 6 UStG. needed.
Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID. his supplier to explain the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT ID number. retroactive in this particular case.
Second
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax office requested the verification of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
From the VIES data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while in a registration certificate issued by the locally competent German FA the date is 1 October 2004.
The German authorities stated in their reply that the German taxpayer was registered on 1 October 2004, but for organizational reasons did not have a VAT ID number on 16 February 2005 in Germany. get assigned.
Upon request from the Czech tax representative, the NKÚ learned that the taxman had carried out a VAT audit of the taxable period from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005 with the Czech taxpayer.
During the audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxable person had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 which he had paid to the German taxpayer before his VAT registration (ie before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office imposed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 on the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the request of the NKÚ, the BRH stated that the German taxpayer had to pay VAT number. was first assigned when he registered with the FA on February 16, 2005 at FA.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to monitor the filing of the 2004 VAT return.
In this VAT return the taxable intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth € 160 (approximately CZK 5,000) were declared.
3. In its VAT return for September 2004 and in its CM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable consignment worth CZK 114,615 was issued to a German taxpayer.
When examining the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official stated that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods had been delivered to Germany.
The Czech taxpayer made a supplementary VAT return in which he explained sales of CZK 114,615 in domestic supplies and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
By requesting it from the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently filed a request for the tax procedure to be reinstated in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As proof, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax authorities that the German taxpayer had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the framework of the international exchange of information.
It was found from the German information that the German taxpayer only had to pay a VAT number on 11 November 2004, ie after the date of delivery of the goods. had been allocated.
As a result, the Czech tax administrator dismissed the request for the reopening of the taxation procedure.
The BRH stated that in this case no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German taxpayer only had a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004. had received.
The German consignee, however, declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the turnover tax on it and also demanded the reimbursement of input tax of the same amount.
Since this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
The BRH further found that the German taxpayer company mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.
This name change in German taxpayers also confused the Czech tax officials.
4th
In the framework of the international exchange of information, the German tax official checked the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxpayer from a German taxpayer worth € 22,686.
By a request to the local competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax inspector had examined in an external audit with the Czech taxpayer whether intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer took the invoice for the delivery of the goods booked and paid.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his sales tax declaration because the German supplier did not include his VAT ID in the invoice. but only stated his tax number for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxpayer is only registered for turnover tax in connection with intra-Community transactions from 21 April 2005, ie after delivery to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech tax administrator also requested that the German tax authorities should send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxpayer, so that he could possibly initiate a corresponding taxation procedure.
The Czech FA considered this transaction to be the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not impose any sales tax on the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that, under German law, a taxpayer who delivers goods to other Member States does not have VAT number. for intra-Community supplies in order to benefit from the VAT exemption for such a supply.
The supplier only has to send the VAT ID. the transferee in the other Member State and can prove the transport of the goods concerned to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is an (exempted) intra-Community supply, which should be subject to the taxation of profits in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this business transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions that are below the minimum threshold of € 15,000: 5.
According to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth € 12,561 from a German taxpayer.
The Czech tax office carried out an audit for this tax period.
In the context of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech tax authorities requested that the goods be checked by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech taxable person stated that he had not received the goods, that he had never been in any business relationship with the German company and that he had not recorded the acquisition of the goods in question.
The German tax authorities rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than € 15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax office did not receive any documents for retrospective taxation of the acquired goods, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax assessment continued.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as "fiscal representative17" (section 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption was recognized.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send to the Czech Republic the documents needed for the subsequent taxation of the acquired goods.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the responses of the German tax authorities to requests for information exceeded the three-month deadline more frequently than the answers of the Czech tax authorities:
6. During its audit, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech tax authorities had sent a request for information on the value of shipments of goods in the fourth quarter of 2004 to Germany.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxpayer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer with a value of € 86,307; However, for the same period, the Czech taxable person declared in his VAT return only the purchase of goods worth € 35,314.
In response to the request for information sent to the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, that is to say after the expiry of the maximum processing time laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side announced that it had requested information can not be processed because the German company was dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax authorities did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax authorities did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax administrator requested by means of a SCAC form requesting the re-examination of motor vehicles in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to a German taxpayer valued at € 1,265,554, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ noted that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
By requesting the local tax office, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxpayer had not declared the delivery of new motor vehicles worth DKK 11,816,103 in his VAT return.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer made a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the locally competent FA for examination.
After the notification by the BRH a special sales tax audit was carried out at the German acquirer in Germany. It was found that the acquisition of all relevant motor vehicles was correctly taxed and that the vehicles were sold to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth € 48,500 from a German taxpayer.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare any intra-Community acquisition.
By request to the local tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not give any tax returns even when requested to do so by the taxman. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period from October to December 2004 at zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to test the said delivery from the German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the taxman, the latter sent a request for information on the abovementioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known by the time the NKÚ audit was completed how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-fulfillment of the obligations under the Czech Value Added Tax Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxpayer was canceled with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial response was sent because at the time of the audit of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not completed the external audit:
9th
In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested by means of a SCAC form the verification of delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth € 16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In its reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that it had only invoices issued by Czech taxpayers for deliveries valued at € 16,335.
Based on the request of the NKÚ, the BRH stated that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed at the purchaser in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth € 16,335 twice in its VAT returns for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax office requested by means of a SCAC form to review the delivery of motor vehicles to the German taxpayer, worth € 198,167, in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax authorities submitted a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, confirming that the German taxpayer had acquired several motor vehicles and, moreover, that the investigation had not yet been completed in Germany.
The NKÚ noted that the locally competent FA had carried out several external inspections of the Czech taxpayer in order to check the deduction of above-average input tax.
However, an unjustified claim was not found.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared in its VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of € 579,114 for the period in question and that the examination of the German FA by the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the VAT return of the recipient and the details in the supplier's DM.
In the audited cases it appeared that periodic discrepancies18 or the incorrect declaration of turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11th
According to data from MIAS, Czech taxpayers purchased goods worth € 35,716 from the German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the taxman and no business was conducted at the company's legal domicile, the Czech tax office requested, as part of the international exchange of information for verification, how the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.
The German reply to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German tax authorities, the Czech taxpayer at the specified address was unknown and the goods were collected by an agreed forwarding agent.
The total value of the order was € 155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth € 21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer a false payment confirmation of the amount of € 155,153 in favor of the German taxpayer.
After discovering the fraudulent behavior of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer was able, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, to get back the delivered material with the exception of a part worth € 7,916.
In a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech taxpayer, the tax authorities subsequently paid VAT of CZK 388,522 on delivery of goods from other Member States.
Following a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had reported only one delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer with a value of € 7,916 following corrections.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter of the reversal.
Its ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12th
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax authorities requested by means of a SCAC form the review of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005.
According to the request for information, the Czech taxpayer had, during the period in question, supplied the German taxable goods with a total value of € 396,126 and provided services worth € 11,885.
The NKÚ noted that the Czech tax authorities had audited the Czech taxpayer to investigate this shipment.
In reply to the request for information, the Czech tax authorities stated that the Czech taxpayer had delivered and installed a production plant for the German.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer did not remove the assembled production plant and claimed deficiencies.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer invoiced the German plant for € 107,100 and € 11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the bills, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.
Upon request to the local tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ stated that all invoices in the books of the Czech taxpayer had been duly recorded.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after May 1, 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the reply of the Czech tax authorities, the local FA came to the conclusion that these transactions were a uniform (goods) supply of the Czech taxpayer to the German, including assembly.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called works delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German service recipient of the works delivery owes VAT in accordance with the German sales tax law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of input tax at the same amount.
Since the VAT liability of the German taxpayer remained unchanged, the German FA did not arrange for a VAT refund.
13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer A acquired in February 2005 a machine worth € 58,000 from the German taxpayer C.
The Czech tax official sent a request for verification of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but had returned it to the German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to information from the German tax authorities, the aircraft was not returned to Germany but transported to the branch of the German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's office in the Czech Republic.
As this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community supply of goods.
By requesting from the local tax office responsible for the taxpayer, the NKÚ stated that, according to the MIAS data, German taxpayers C had delivered to the Czech taxable goods (another machine) worth € 88,027 in the third quarter of 2004.
The taxable person B stated that he had not received the goods so that the locally competent Czech tax officer sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further inquiries into taxpayer B, the taxman stated that the machine worth € 88,027 had not been recognized in taxpayer B and that it could be the same kind of machine as the German taxpayer C's branch office in February 2005 delivered to the Czech taxpayer A.
The NKÚ also noted that the local Czech tax officer responsible for taxpayer A had carried out an audit.
The taxman had the invoice of the German taxpayer C dated 7 February 2005, in which the taxpayer A was specified as the consignee of the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found that taxpayer A had not booked this bill.
Taxpayer A had entered into a lease agreement with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also arranged for the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information given in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxable person A.
The BRH found that the German taxable person C had not delivered the machine to the value of € 88,027 to the Czech Republic but to another German taxpayer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community supply of goods but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognize the right of the German taxable person to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German taxpayer D delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
Under German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH further stated that the German taxpayer C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth € 58,000 to the Czech taxpayer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below illustrates the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above transactions.
14th
In examining the requests for information received, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax authorities had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005 in which a German tax official asked for a check of intra-Community supplies of a German taxpayer worth € 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer ,
The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fi ctive intra-Community supply of goods.
The German taxpayer has not had any active business activity since 1999.
The NKÚ noted that the Czech tax officer had carried out an external audit of the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company stated that it was probably a claim of the German taxpayer against the German tax authority, which the Czech taxpayer had claimed as a shareholder in the German company in the German FA.
According to the information provided to NKÚ, the Czech tax administrator has so far had no information that the German tax authorities are handling the case with respect to the Czech taxpayer.
The information available shows that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the VIES as an intra-Community supply of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax declarations of the recipients (see also section 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, during the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer supplied a total of € 33,205 in taxable goods to the Czech Republic.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare intra-Community acquisition.
As part of the inter-state exchange of information, the Czech tax office requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.
In its reply to that request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that he had personally collected the rest of the goods.
Upon request to the locally competent Czech financial officer, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the relevant period before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the value of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so that the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit of the Czech taxpayer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the VIES data, in the third quarter of 2004 a German taxpayer had delivered to a Czech taxable goods worth € 46.854.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared that intra-Community purchases of goods worth only € 14,856.
As part of the inter-state exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
The German reply to this question sent three invoices indicating a total value of the delivered goods of € 31,999, ie an amount equal to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the VIES data.
Upon request to the Czech tax representative, the NKÚ stated that, after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had turned to the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and had remained with her, after having examined the invoices, together with the proprietor of the company Wanted to talk about sales tax returns for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no additional sales tax return has been submitted.
The Czech tax administrator informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT assessment for the relevant tax period would be respected.
17th
In the fourth quarter of 2004 German taxable goods worth € 11,600 were delivered to German taxpayers.
As part of the exchange of information between Member States, the German tax official asked for a check to see whether the Czech taxpayer mentioned actually existed, since the alleged owner of the capital of the German taxpayer had founded a number of false certificates in Germany.
In the course of the review of the operation by the FA, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
However, according to the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer provided evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as a taxable person in Germany and did not tax the sale of the product concerned either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax office provided this information in its reply to the request for information to the German tax authorities.
Upon request to the locally competent Czech taxman, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxpayer had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 due to a tax audit in which he declared, inter alia, the value of the goods which he had acquired from a German taxpayer and at the same time asserted the right of deduction for the acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare sales tax on the sale of goods in Germany.
Due to a supplementary VAT return issued after the external audit, the Czech tax official set the VAT liability unchanged.
According to the Czech legislation, in this case there was no acquisition of goods from other Member States since the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official drew a false conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that, immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, stating that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax office had corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of VAT amounting to € 1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control message to the FA responsible for the actual consignee of the goods in order to ensure that the resale of those goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community supplies that may not have been carried out:
18th
The Czech tax office received a request for information from the German tax authorities on the question of whether the Czech taxpayer had acquired a car worth € 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.
As a further attachment a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who should have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of its investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named therein had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that it had no contacts with a German taxpayer.
The VAT Registration Certificate, the impression of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax authorities.
The Czech tax office answered the request for information with this information and at the same time stated that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car.
By request to the locally competent Czech tax administrator, the NKÚ stated that the Czech taxpayer does not have his seat at the address given in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not available.
Following a tax appeals procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax office set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at zero.
Following a further investigation, the Czech Finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the internet.
The BRH found that the locally competent German tax official had refused the German taxpayer's claim for exemption from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of € 3,000 between the value of the acquired goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer was expected to deliver goods worth € 89,424 to a German taxpayer.
As the German declared taxpayer did not agree with the VIES data, the German tax office requested the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the inter-state exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole director of the Czech company was deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer issued a VAT return and a ZM which had been signed in the commercial register by an unauthorized person, namely the shareholder of the company, after the removal of the managing director.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the taxman that the capital owner had paid the payment received in euros for the invoiced goods to the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By requesting the Czech local FA, the NKÚ stated that the tax office had recognized the Czech taxpayer's claim to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005 ,
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the bankruptcy of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit did not show any signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to levy a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, in 2005 a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic amounting to € 4,251,196, after having purchased goods worth € 43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions either in its 2004 VAT return or in 2005.
In addition, he did not declare equivalent value-based sales.
Because of these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information concerning the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods totaling 167,246,083 CZK.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech tax authorities stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company had no managing director (or other legal representative).
It is apparent from the documents provided to the NKÚ by the competent taxman that a record of the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005 was drawn up on 30 March 2006 together with the manager of the Czech taxpayer ,
The taxpayer was at the same time requested by the taxman to submit all the accounting and tax records for that period but did not.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on May 16, 2005, without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech taxpayer has not paid any sales tax declarations since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany that were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information about the audited cases via the CLOs of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to carry out taxable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but received no German VAT ID number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the manufacture of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria in the name, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own manufacturing capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German taxpayer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines in his name, at his risk and for his own account for assembly in Austria.
Because of the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, ie the delivery of wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and had the latter carry out the transport in his own name, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE) is where the transport started, ie in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient was registered as taxable in one EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the supply of the German subcontractor (UDE) as the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the country of residence of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, this supply is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed deduction of VAT in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, in some of the wind turbines, transport was from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) has not declared any intra-Community supplies in its German tax returns or in its ZM issued to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ noted that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.
To ensure taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there are no signs of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined cases to show the size of the differences between the statements in the VAT returns and the VIES data caused by the different 2004 legislation.
The audited cases also show that it takes some time before taxpayers and FÄs apply the new legislation:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable supply of goods totaling CZK 792,977.452 reported to a German taxpayer.
During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-Community deliveries to its other counterpart in the Community to another German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
From the information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ, it emerged that in both cases electricity was supplied.
Both Czech taxpayers included the abovementioned deliveries in their CM in accordance with the Czech Law No 235/2004 in force in 2004.
In a further review of these transactions, a NKÚ audit group noted that in 2004 there were different legal provisions governing the supply or purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, the taxpayers are responsible for the supply of electrical energy in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 235/2004 as intra-Community deliveries of goods, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, this was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal regulations were abolished in the Czech Republic by adopting Law No. 635/2004, which with effect from 1 January 2005 changed some tax provisions.
23. When examining intra-Community supplies or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxpayer in his CM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 supplied intra-Community supplies to a German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech Taxpayer in his ZM declared intra-Community deliveries to another German taxpayer worth CZK 263,470,776 for the same period.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that both cases involved supplies of electrical energy.
According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004, which applies from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the transferee has his legal domicile, place of business or permanent establishment for which the delivery takes place.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have specified the electricity deliveries in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their CM as intra-Community supplies resulted in a difference of CZK 503.881.939 in MIAS.
concluding remark
The cooperation achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKÚ.
Both audit offices gained in-depth knowledge of the systems of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The collaboration revealed differences in the two systems and in the VAT regulations.
During the parallel examinations, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
For some of them worth a further observation.
Based on the audit findings, both SAIs prepared recommendations on the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a check should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through cooperation between the two courts of auditors form the basis for the successful conduct of future VAT audits.
