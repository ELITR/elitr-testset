Public procurement of construction services and prevention of corruption
Joint report by the Supreme Control Board of the Czech Republic (NKcomo) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel examinations
Introduction and overview
The awarding of services by public authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The task of the state is to use public funds as economically and sparingly as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the awarding of services by public authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure largely unlimited competition across borders, the contracting authorities must comply with certain EU values (thresholds) in their alloyment of certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, EU member states must transfer and apply EU procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate public procurement themselves.
The awarding of benefits is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the generally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and inadmissible advantages in awarding their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Board of the Czech Republic (NKcomo) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits on both EU-wide allocation of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
The examinations focused on the application of EU procurement law, which is transferred to national rules, as well as the prevention of corruption in the allocation of construction services in construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds were also included in the considerations with regard to corruption prevention.
The audit results of both Court of Auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report is also intended to address international bodies â€“ such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional examinations carried out in 201201EB14 2012 at the building authorities responsible for the road and construction of the Federal authorities in Germany.
For example, he examined the construction of motorways as well as large-scale construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office used results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Board of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit skills from 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction work in road construction, rail transport, water construction, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of the federal government public contracts is predominantly carried out by the building administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for transport infrastructure awards.
In construction, the awarding is carried out in a decentralised manner by those which use state budgets.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in parts of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Building procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules based on it.
Both EU-wide and national procurement, many complementary individual arrangements are laid down by intra-administrative provisions,
For example, the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with the law on procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed solely by the procurement law and other legal provisions applicable to both the area above and below the EU thresholds.
The law on procurement was significantly amended in 2012.
The new regulation strengthened transparency in the use of public funds, allowed for increased competition and limited the possibilities for corruption in the procurement process.
Broad guidelines of procurement law in both countries
In both countries, EU-wide awards in particular involve the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are used by national categories of procurement (public tendering, limited tendering, free-handed procurement), but which are broadly in line with the aforementioned EU-wide procurement types.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for contracts to be carried out across the EU) and public tendering (for national awards).
In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another key feature of German procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction project into skilled and partial loose.
The individual awarding of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are employed in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures must also be applied to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law contains provisions, in accordance with EU law, to conclude contracts when competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the issuing authorities to choose between the open and the unopen procedure.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are employed by 20 or more.
Volume of construction of public clients and shares of procurement sites in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.
Of this amount, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15%), which in addition to federal construction in particular also includes the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in construction and highway construction (excluding rail road construction and water construction) comprised 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in federal construction and long-distance road construction was distributed between the procurement types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders and 6.6% Negotiation procedures and free-handed awards.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic in 2011 amounted to EUR 4.7 billion, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to EUR 7.8 billion, representing 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of procurement for 2011:65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiation procedures 8.4% simplified procedures with order volume below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded by public procurement agencies in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries are directed at a significant part of public procurement, the risk of corruption to be respected in all awards is of great financial importance and that, in the awarding of contracts, the Open procedures and public tenders have an outstanding place
Summary of the results of parallel examinations
The Supreme Control Board of the Czech Republic (NKcomo) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on EU-wide allocation of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both Court of Auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out, particularly in the areas of the Czech Republic and Germany. Construction and road construction.
In doing so, they essentially stated:
The EU directives on the awarding of construction services by public authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also used by the procurement regulations of both countries, which differ in part in their priorities and their detailing (point 3.2).
In both countries, a key requirement for procurement documents is that they must contain all the information needed to make an appropriate offer.
Performance descriptions must be neutral and must not have a competitive advertising limiting basis.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject matter sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services must be divided into lots as far as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
During its audits, the NKcomo found, particularly in the area of road construction, that the awarding of large-scale services without lots or with only very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing market potential can lead to significant cost increases and risk price or other collusion.
Under the terms of both countries, under certain conditions, the awarding authorities can, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted, which are necessary after the conclusion of the original contract. (# 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of procurement were mostly followed in both countries.
Under the Czech Republic's rules, the awarding authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the priority of the open procedure for EU-wide awards or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure in the case of national awards, applies to the legal and budgetary principles of the open procedure for EU-wide awards or the public tender.
This will allow more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price fixing between bidders and leads to the most economical results.
For construction projects whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations awarded the construction services throughout Europe.
The accurate estimation of the expected value of the order is an essential basis in the choice of the correct type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used for cost investigations in public buildings, particularly in construction,
The construction projects completed on the evaluations are based.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but this is not yet an effective instrument (point 4.2).
In the case of construction services to be allocated throughout Europe, advance information and announcements must be made public. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adapt to the planned awards at an early stage.
The audited building administrations generally adhered to this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates to participate in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed beforehand.
In addition to EU requirements, the awarding authorities in both countries should switch as often as possible among companies to be recruited when selecting applicants.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed requirements in Germany.
The audited administrations did not take these requirements into account in some cases.
In the Czech Republic, the selection of candidates decisions were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interests of equal competition, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in submitting an offer receive the same information during the offer phase.
Contact between these companies and freelance professionals involved in the preparation of the service description must be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The relevant regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited building administrations in Germany partially failed to meet these requirements (No. 4.5).
In the opening up of the offers, the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency must be observed in both countries in particular.
The requirements for the marking, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are set in particular in detail in Germany.
The examinations in both countries revealed few complaints (No. 4.6).
In both countries, the inspection and evaluation of the offers are determined by requirements for the construction and draining organisation.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited awarding agencies.
For example, awarding agencies handed over offers to third parties for inspection without first reviewing the offers and sufficiently documenting any abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition are to be informed of the intended assignment before the award of the contract.
This legal protection option also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review option for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the awarding authorities not meet the specified deadlines in the order departments or deviate in terms of content from the bidders ' offer (point 4.8 above).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible to the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notes of some procedures.
Some of the deficiencies identified also reduced the corruption-preventative function of documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
The foundations of EU procurement law and prevention of corruption
EU procurement law
In order to ensure unlimited competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the procurement and the Appeals Directive which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States 8.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, the requirement for competition, the requirement of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the transparency requirement.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Directive contains specific rules for EU-wide construction services for construction projects.
In order to achieve this, their projected order amounts must reach or exceed the current level of 5.000.000.
The rules relate in particular to the content of the procurement documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the adherence to deadlines, including for receipt of the offers, the documentation of the procurement procedure, the requirements The right to be placed on the qualifications of the candidates and the Appeals Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, affected companies may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in verification proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Anti-corruption prevention
Importance of corruption prevention
In both countries, there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a trust for private gain,
Is usually prompted by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hamper competition and result in significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of the world's economic output.
For the European Union, the size of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair behaviour can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the basic tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they must check the establishment and drainage organisation of their administrations for areas that are particularly at risk of corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly limit the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The awarding of public works is, in principle, regarded as a field of work that is particularly at risk of corruption.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption â€“ in particular bribery and bribery, as well as acceptance and authorization-is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
To prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed in the procurement area in particular: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principles and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and billing, accuracy And full documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the provisions of the law on procurement law.
In 2011, for example, the competent Federal Ministry of Forever of Forgiving in the area of the Federal Highway introduced an electronically supported control system,
With the award data-such as the estimated costs and the order totals-as well as information on the freelance professionals involved, are collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legally prescribed precepts of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, form the most important basis of the prevention of corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper to combat corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended therein have already been transposed into national procurement law and relevant administrative regulations.
The new legislation essentially includes the following provisions: Reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to pre-announce the awarding by the awarding authority, including citing the grounds for tendering, prohibiting the restriction of the Number of bidders in non-open proceedings and thus abolition of the possibility of bidder selection through batch procedures, introduction of the obligation to publish the order documents and all annexes, the introduction of the obligation to publish the Actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Exam results on the individual phases of the procurement process
Procurement documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information that bidders need to make an appropriate bid.
In particular, the procurement documents must allow for an accurate calculation.
Bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The procurement documents consist in particular of the terms of the service and the terms of the contract.
They also contain the requirements for proving the qualifications (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are based in particular on the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The performance description must be product neutral in principle.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under narrow conditions.
Avoiding competition-limiting requirements in procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents must be avoided, since it opens up scope for speculation in the creation of the bids and for manipulations in their evaluation.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Similar or similar regulations In both countries, EU legal requirements on technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
The services must in principle be advertisement in a product-neutral manner without factory specifications.
In the performance descriptions, the individual services must normally be divided into performance units with respective quantity data in detail.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of unit services (e.g. euros per m Â² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
The performance descriptions must in any case be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services that do not determine whether they are needed.
Remunerations by lump sum or after time must be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the procurement documents.
Performance descriptions must allow bidders to create their offerings safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders is not to be made known until the award documents have been finalised.
Different regulations
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be carried, the public procurement agencies can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are generally divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and/or by type or subject (skilled).
The aim is to enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make price fixing more difficult.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical in terms of the rule.
Valuation criteria must be set out in procurement documents in the Czech Republic for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This should make it fully and conclusively clear to candidates what criteria their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but no later than in the procurement documents, is only mandatory in the EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be recorded in an internal marketing note under administrative control.
Procurement documents prepared by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or reviewers in Germany to the construction and some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge through contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelance professionals are not allowed to send or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is the sole client.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or amended services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), almost always apply to large construction projects.
In both countries, the statutory provisions allow, to some extent, the award of submissions to the already contracted company, without the possibility of a procurement procedure with public notice.
According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary benefits must not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower 20% limit applies to allocation without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If additional services are also transferred to the already contracted company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is not possible in principle, according to the regulations in Germany.
On the contrary, in determining the remuneration for the additional services, it must be assumed that the agreed prices and the basis for the price assessment of the order already granted must be based.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, underquantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary benefits.
Key exam results
Bhr
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
On a case-by-case basis, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical authorisations or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related requirements â€“ such as graffiti protection, joint bands or noise protection panels â€“, without the need for this.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was eligible.
Performance directories broken down by partial services
In none of the proceedings examined did the BRH find any breaches of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services broken down by partial services.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the vast majority of proceedings, the procurement documents were completed before the tenders began.
In some procedures, the award documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some of the items or deadlines had changed.
Occasionally, the performance directories contained positions that did not determine whether they were needed.
A list of performance for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such demand positions.
Loose and evaluation criteria
Many awards lacked the prescribed justification for the reasons why the benefits, which were predominantly advertised according to the skilled person, were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no complaints when it comes to specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the bids.
References to freelancers
A small portion of the performance descriptions included references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or expert opinions.
In one case, the awarding body even specifically asked applicants to contact the architect "on issues of tendering."
In the field of construction in particular, the awarding authorities attributed the complaints identified mainly to the failings of freelancers tasked with producing the performance descriptions.
Construction services pointed to the lack of capacity to adequately control performance descriptions.
NKcomo
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender In the case of public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a certain product mark were specified in the service description.
The awarding authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying it.
During the construction of several university buildings, the call also provided suppliers and products.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the procurement authority did not clearly identify the scope and nature of the required services in the performance descriptions.
As power units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of performance descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were amended four times under a non-open procedure between August and September 2009,
As the range of services had increased significantly and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings included inaccurate location information, inadequate structural preliminary investigations and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not include product quality requirements.
As a result of these lack of requirements, some subcontractors built in overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial or partial contracts is not mandatory.
An audit of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded in a loose way, savings of up to EUR 31.6 million would have been possible with a total cost of EUR 620.3 million.
For example, in the case of six different buildings, which were the subject of a single contract, EUR 2.5 million (25%) would have been awarded in a loose contract. Savable.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be awarded without a loose period, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would be compared to a total award. Been possible.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central awarding body set very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the awarding body required the bidders to demonstrate, among other things, at least three road projects carried out, each worth 28 million euros from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public allocation of another section of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects in which the awarding body had set an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million for the companies over the last three years as a criterion for suitability for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. EUR 2.5 billion out of a total of EUR 3.7 billion) were accounted for by the commissioners of a total of five companies carrying out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In the case of 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even one bidder made an offer.
The NKcomo showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
When building a motorway bypass, the awarding body did not apply any of the statutory procedures when awarding additional services in two cases, nor did it enter into written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, entries were generated in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the procurement documents, although their necessity in awarding the contract was already known.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the 20% of the original value of the contract set by national procurement law, the awarding body conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without announcing the award.
In the construction of a large courthouse, the awarding authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation proceedings without a call for tenders.
During the construction period, the awarding authority expanded the scope of the work by EUR 2 million.
Unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
As a result of a sampling of construction projects, the NC found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway plant in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway engine is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly in line in both countries and take EU requirements into account.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient accuracy of performance descriptions should allow bidders to properly calculate and create their offers,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed afterwards and also curb speculative leeway.
The common basic requirements for procurement documents are supplemented in Germany by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and manipulation.
There are no provisions on this scale in the Czech Republic, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria in the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
Performance description requirements have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, there have been complaints of deviations, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the examination findings of the NKcomo, the awarding of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can result in restrictions on the provider field on only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements set out in the Czech Republic in road construction have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow group of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises do not participate in the competition. Is made possible.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other arrangements.
When awarding and remuneration additional or amended benefits, the regulatory approaches differ from one another in both countries.
According to EU regulations and German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main order can be awarded under certain conditions without the award procedure with public notice.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, until additional services in the negotiation process can be awarded to the original contractor without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often crossed,
As the scope of services for public contracts is often inadequately determined.
If the exceedance is greater than 20%, the additional benefits must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing benefits into lots, restrictions on competition and consequent adverse consequences can be avoided.
Set the type of procurement and take into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the amount of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It may leave the circle of possible candidates and bidders, for example by choosing an open procedure, largely unlimited or limit it by specifying non-public procurement procedures.
Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied to construction projects where an EU-set threshold is reached or exceeded.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European law's rights to compete and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is in or above the EU threshold of currently 5.000.000 EUR, the construction services must in principle be allocated throughout Europe in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and allocate construction services in national procurement, provided that the estimated Order value of the respective lot is below 1.000.000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total order value of all construction orders.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures for no reason or deliberately valued at too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to allocate the construction services in principle across Europe.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of procurement is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The in-depth justification of the chosen type of procurement as well as the examination of the application obligation of the EU procurement rules are important components of the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU legal requirements on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Different regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction awards, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision being dokued or justified. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible according to certain conditions defined by law.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or â€“ of national awards-the public tender is fundamentally a priority. This is determined by budgetary and procurement law and by the directives on preventing corruption.
Other types of procurement â€“ as well as the non-open procedure or the limited tender-are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated under procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the primacy of open procedure or public tendering is intended to ensure as unlimited competition as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying certain bidders and to avoid possible price fixing among the Complicate bidders.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The accurate estimation of the expected value of the order is an essential basis in the choice of the correct type of contract.
Construction services in Germany can draw on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the projected costs of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost indicators for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.
Based on such cost indicators, the expected order value of a planned pre-life or a construction service to be allocated can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few construction administrations in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Procurement agencies in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price assessments of comparable construction measures to determine the likely cost of construction services.
On the contrary, the cost investigations are, in most cases, based on estimates of the financing body or from the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
The relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials as part of the Anti-Corruption Plan for 2011-2012.

The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure and construction and expansion structures as well as other cost-relevant data in order to enable cost assessments and provisions of unit prices.
In order to better control costs, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects,
The aim of setting prices in the financing plan will serve as a benchmark and is currently being updated.
Key exam results BRH
Choice of procurement procedure
The audited awarding agencies largely tendered the construction services in open procedures or in public tenders, thus following the budgetary and procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of federal construction services in construction were advertised publicly or in open proceedings.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
In the election of non-public categories of awarding, there was a lack of partial incoming justification as to why the awarding authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional study, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public procurement types had significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders, and that the types of non-public contracts were significantly disadvantages to the competition. Increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the building, more than twice as many bids were submitted in public tenders as in the case of limited tenders and almost three times as many bids as for free-handed bids.
The research also found that offer prices for limited tenders and free-handed allocations were on average 6% and 10% higher respectively than for public tenders.
Parallel studies by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a state accounting body confirmed the differences in profitability between public and non-public procurement types.
As a result of its studies on profitability, the Federal Ministry of Construction even found twice as high a difference between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Considering the EU threshold
The audited procurement agencies usually drew up procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had identified a projected total order of more than 5.000.000 euros, in which they have the following EU-wide and national procurement procedures. awarded construction services.
According to the procurement plans, more than 80% of construction services have always been allocated across the EU.
It was not possible to circumcise the commitment to EU-wide awards by means of underestimated cost estimates.
However, some of the erroneous calculations led to the de facto undermining of the minimum share of the EU-wide procurement procedure.
During the construction, some awarding agencies improperly changed the provisions of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures was still being followed.
For most of the construction measures audited, the share of EU-wide awards was usually lower according to the settlement results than envisaged under the procurement plan.
In some cases, the procurement authorities, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, have been in breach of the requirement to tender all 1.000.000 of euros and more comprehensive single lone in EU-wide procedures,
And chose national procedures instead.
NKcomo
Choice of award type
In several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the awarding services divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services are similar. Or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified proceedings or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the price databases available in this area were an insufficient instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on just completed construction projects, but where there was evidence of a lack of economic viability, unnecessary additional performance or excessive profits from the contracted firms.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% below those of likely order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the prices of the offer in recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In the building, the expected order values were based on the estimated cost values or on estimates of the investors.
Actual order values diverged greatly from estimates.
The estimate price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later, but eight supplements led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros or 27% as part of the construction process.
Similarly, the actual value of the contract when building a library depot was 33% lower than the estimate price, with cost increases in the construction phase as well.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
When a large library was built, the estimate price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. When building a judicial building, costs increased disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had expanded by only 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU rules for determining the type of procurement and taking the EU threshold into account into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are broadly in line.
However, the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the competition in public proceedings or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of bids and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is greatly improved by not restricting the applicant field by tamper-prone provisions of the client and by making price fixing between bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the benefits of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, procurement agencies can award contracts in open or non-open proceedings.
Following the latest changes in procurement law, the number of bidders in proceedings involving previous competition may no longer be restricted.
As a result, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the awarding authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services were divided inadmissibly in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be identified in Germany which resulted in a fall in the minimum share of EU-wide advertised benefits.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to correctly determine the expected cost of construction and construction projects.
Building administrations should, where appropriate, ensure, through further checks, that the requirements for the choice of procurement and the EU-wide scope of services are met or that the conditions for accurate cost investigations are created.
Pre-information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned awards in advance of the call for tenders.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential procurement data on the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total order value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide more details on the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he must make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the contract, the vocabulary of Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes) is to be used throughout Europe.
Preliminary information and announcements are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the client's procurement profile.
In order to prevent the disadvantage of foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may not contain any additional information until the notice text has been sent to the Office of Official Publications of the European Union. Published.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and, if necessary, even support tampering.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The EU legal requirements for prior information and publication have fully transposed both countries into national law.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published for construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement proceedings may not be started until one month at the earliest after the pre-information is sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the national Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of advance information be dispensed with.
In Germany, no prior information is required in the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and competitions must be published on the federal Internet portal before limited tenders and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of limited tenders without competition for participation, announcements of services to be awarded are required from 25,000 euros (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small part of the raffle of construction awards.
In the Czech Republic, this regulation has little effect, as much less construction services are divided into lots there.
Key exam results
BRH
Preliminary information
The audited procurement agencies published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be allocated throughout Europe.
However, in some open procedures, they shortened offer deadlines, although the 52-day period required between the submissions of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the 12-month period of prior information had already expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked evidence of the planned division of construction services into lots.
Notices
The announcements of the audited bodies contained partial CPV codes, which deviated from the information provided by the preliminary information or which did not correctly cover the required services.
In individual cases, announcements were made public at national level earlier or contained more information â€“ such as on execution periods â€“ than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante Transparency
The awarding agencies of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the notifications on its own paid award platform.
However, the awarding authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the federal government's free internet portal, as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited administration's notifications were published on this portal.
NKcomo
Notices
When building a wastewater treatment plant, the awarding body did not specify in its notice the criteria by which it intended to select the bidders.
The awarding body could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction on the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the awarding body did not specify either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it would evaluate the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants they wanted to allow to compete. .
The awarding body concluded in its assessment that all six applicants met qualification requirements, but excluded applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procurement authority's approach was not transparent because, at no point in the procedure, had it disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation process.
Publication of the notices
In the refurbishment of former military sites, the awarding body did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-tier teaching system with advance information and publication is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide awards, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU requirements and have also increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public procurement types
Unlike public procurement procedures, not every company interested in carrying out the services to be awarded cannot participate in the competition in non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the awarding authority must make a selection in advance as to which companies should be invited to submit an offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention EU regulations allow a limit on the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are to be required to submit an offer.
At least three companies must be invited in the case of negotiation proceedings with the announcement of the award.
In any case, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed beforehand.
The selection of companies to be arising is a process within the procurement process that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by favouring certain companies unilaterally.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible collusion by applicants.
In both cases, the delivery result may be significantly affected at the expense of the client.
The awarding authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules on the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding agencies should switch as often as possible among companies to be recruited when selecting candidates.
Nor should competition be restricted to companies located in certain regions.
The awarding authorities must justify the selection of candidates and document the course of the selection process in their award notes.
Different regulations
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three and in the case of free-handed allocations, several suitable applicants are to be invited to submit an offer.
Under the new Czech rules, it is inadmissible-apart from two special areas-to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or an agent from the registrel usually have to amend that proposal by, for example, Take out proposed companies and/or supplement a new company.
This is to prevent a single person from finally being able to determine the circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for wide-ranging collusion between the parties involved.
The list of companies to be opened up must â€“ also be kept confidential to freelancers â€“ and not made widely available.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for the establishment and secret of list candidates.
Under the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to identify the companies to be set up, but can only submit proposals to the awarding authority.
There is a regulatory loophole in Czech legislation.
Key exam results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to ask a minimum number of companies to submit an offer in the case of non-public contracts has been met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-pan-European procurement procedures of construction services in construction showed that the awarding agencies had an average of 6.6 in the case of limited tenders from the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 for free-handed contracts. Companies asked for the offer levy.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular, for trades with few providers, the awarding agencies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
In particular, they took into account companies that were already known to them and that they were tried and tested.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be charged for competition even before the invitation to submit an offer.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction on regional bidders in non-public procurement procedures, but it did find a higher proportion of regionally resident companies than in public tenders.
The awarding authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is much lower on average and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.
Multi-eye principle and proposals freelance professionals
Contrary to the rules, the awarding authorities were largely prohibited from having the proposed list of companies to be enlisted amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacity, scheduling pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies called for the offer.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the list of applicants and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the awarding authorities.
In this way, the awarding authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidding lists
At a registry office, the lists of companies to be accited were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of the service.
In the event of manipulative intent, the names of the companies intended or authorised could have been passed on unauthorised and could have enabled, for example, collusion among those undertakings.
Documentation
The documentation of the procurement procedures contained reasons for the selection of candidates only in a few cases.
NKcomo
Selection of candidates
When building a motorway ring, bidders were not given any information on the assessment criteria and assessment procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the expansion and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies allowed.
The Procurement Committee then carried out a lot procedure for selecting the companies.
However, this approach, which was generally allowable at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of applicants in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secret of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the awarding agencies to propose the companies to be challenged, the German requirements restrict such possibilities for abuse.
In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in the case of non-public proceedings may, in particular, counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for the misuse of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficiencies identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or with the solicitation of an offer, the offer phase begins, in which the companies can create offers on the basis of the award documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their offers until the offer period set by the awarding authority expires.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement process.
The awarding authorities must comply with the national rules designed to counteract the possibility of manipulation during the offer phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
As a matter of principle, the procurement documents on the basis of which the companies are supposed to draw up their offers are to be sent only through the awarding authority.
Freelance professionals involved in the procurement process are not allowed to carry out this task.
The registering authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the offer phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the procurement documents or other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the issuing authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelance professionals entrusted with the preparation of the procurement documents are not allowed to provide any information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the employed freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelance professionals must not become a hub of the procurement process, through which contacts can be established with anti-competitive consequences.
Offers submitted directly by post or directly.
Electronically transmitted offers have technical encryption.
Different regulations
In Germany, the awarding agency may also entrust the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents with external service companies to provide their employees with the secrecy of the offers and the conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations. Committed.
The offers received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and forwarded immediately, immediately and unopened to a staff member responsible for the custody.
This staff member may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The issuer records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt information in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not regulated in more detail in the Czech Republic.
Key exam results
BRH
The extra-phase audits focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building administration.
Shipping of procurement documents
The awarding agencies of the certified building management sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelance workers did not send procurement documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building management mostly did not comply with the requirements for separating planning and awarding when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the performance descriptions, contrary to the guidelines, she did not give employees from the awarding authority, but from the project management as contact persons.
Some award documents even included the names of freelance professionals who had produced the performance descriptions.
In the case of inquiries during the quotation phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of the offers
In the tested building management, all offers received were provided with input stamps and input notices.
In the case of some free-handed awards, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for the prevention of corruption.
Preserving the offers
Once they had been labelled, not all offers arrived immediately and immediately to the staff member responsible for the custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were stored in a construction department in an open compartment of the post office, to which each staff member had access.
Another service had hung a mailbox in a non-constantly monitored hallway, in which the offers sent in there sometimes remained even overnight.
Since the insertion slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to take offers received and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
NKcomo
There were no complaints on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the offer phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in particular in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.
The rules on receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers appear to be suitable in order to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have resulted in violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be addressed with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders will be bound by their bids until the expiry of the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
No separate EU legislation is laid down for the opening of the bids.
However, the national rules on the prevention of corruption contain extensive requirements for the protection of offers and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement process.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date must be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The aim of the multi-eye principle is to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when opening up the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only offers that have been available to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are allowed for the opening.
As a matter of principle, late offers may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be set out in a protocol which, among other things, shall include the names of the bidders and the quotation prices.
The minutes must be read out and signed by the negotiating management.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee is opening up the bids.
Freelance professionals can also participate.
The Committee may also be tasked with further stages of the procurement process, such as the evaluation of the bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be a staff member of the tendering body.
The negotiator and the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the award and contract processing.
In the minutes of the opening date, in accordance with the German regulations, information about discounts and discounts as well as special features-such as damaged or late-received offers-must be recorded in addition to the quotation prices.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer as well as the signature authoristee's applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be labelled in all parts in such a way as to prevent subsequent changes and additions.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to those directly entrusted with the processing.
There are no Czech regulations to do so.
If only one offer is received in a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unprocessed.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received here, it must be opened and then evaluated.

BRH
Multi-eye principle
The audited awarding bodies implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle in the opening dates.
They each conducted the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries tasked with no other procurement trades.
In the case of free-handed awards of lower levels of services, however, there have been isolated cases in which freelance workers open offers sent to them without the participation of the awarding authority.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the bids was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered, and in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of the offers
The procurement agencies examined during the cross-sectional examination marked the bids in accordance with the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
For more recent audits of some grant recipients, inadequate labelling had been found.
However, these awarding agencies changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
NKcomo
Offer period
When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was not received by the awarding authority until one month after the offer period expired. The registering body nevertheless accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The rules of both countries to open up the offers are in line with significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. This can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening up of bids.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for accurate documentation of the process as well as on the labelling, safe custody and secrecy of the offers significantly limit the possibility of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, the agents responsible for opening up the offers may not perform any other tasks relating to the service to be awarded.
The only few complaints show the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.
Review and evaluation of offers
The client must review and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, he has to determine the offer for the award of the surcharge, which best meets the requirements according to the prescribed award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The EU's requirements provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies which are legally convicted of infringing offences for bribery offences must be excluded from participation in the procurement procedure.
The offers of the unexcluded bidders must be examined in terms of computational, technical and economic analysis and assessed on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. The client has to examine offers with unusually low prices in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the bids is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the procurement process.
For example, bidders may be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvantages bidders, the value result can be inadmissibly affected and thus the determination of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The issuing authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons entrusted with the audit and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
In line with EU requirements, the offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the certificates of suitability of the companies to be presented, as well as the surcharge criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting, are laid down in the announcements or in the procurement documents and cannot be used during the proceedings. More will be changed.
After checking the bidder's appropriation, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined formally as to whether they are complete and whether, for example, they contain any abnormalities which could indicate possible intent to manipulate.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken in the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Different regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing them.
Only the issuing authority may carry out the review of the offers as well as the computational examination of the offers.
It only has to appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.
If freelancers are charged with the examination and evaluation, they must keep the offers confidential.
You can only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the awarding authorities.
In the Czech Republic, procurement committees must be set up to examine and assess the bids.
The committees prepare evaluation reports with procurement proposals.
In the end, the awarding of contracts â€“, as in Germany â€“ only have to be decided by the awarding agencies.
If documents or declarations required for the offer are submitted only incompletely in Germany, the issuing authority must give the bidders the opportunity to file the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline, can the offer be excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the issuing body whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial benefits) of the offers are also to be examined.
If, on the basis of the price structure of the offer, there is evidence of too low or too high prices for partial services, the bidder must be required to dispel these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and can provide the awarding authority with proof of a mixed calculation of prices, this offer must be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant volume changes in partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases in construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is calculated, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial benefits.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
A surcharge may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more offers are subject to the correct price calculation of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the proper calculation of their offers.
If they do not make this possible, the issuing authority may exclude the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders can be cancelled after the economic viability has been examined if there are only offers with non-justifiable at low prices.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge for offers with prices that are significantly higher than the client's calculation cannot be refused for this reason.
If there are suspicions of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the awarding authority must immediately report to its leading specialist supervisor.
It must decide what measures to take and whether the antitrust authority or the Public Prosecutor's Office should be informed.
The technical supervisor management, for example, must also agree to more than 50,000 euros in the case of construction services if a surgeflare is not to be awarded, a surcharge is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such arrangements in the Czech Republic.

Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the stated requirements.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the awarding agencies did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
One recipient contracted companies without the required proof of suitability being fully available.
In some proceedings it was incomprehensible whether the awarding authority took all the award criteria known in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the ' price ' criterion.
Selection of the persons involved and secrecy of the offers
Some issuers used unauthorised persons when examining the bids.
For example, freelancers or employees involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be carried out by employees of the awarding office.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, freelancers charged with examining the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to the conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.
For the construction services it was usually also incomprehensible whether the offers to the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Review and computational review of the offers
Some awarding agencies handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having first carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination themselves and dokued their results.
In the event of manipulative intent, third parties could have made changes to the bids without this being comprehensible to the awarding authorities.
In the documents examined, some of the abnormalities or lack of price or product information were not or only inadequately marked.
Profitability audits
For a sample in a construction administration, the cheapest offers for three-quarters of the procurement procedures audited varied more than 10% from the previously determined estimate costs.
One in 20 procurement procedures has been overturned because of unreasonable offer prices.
Not all offer reviews and reconnaissance discussions with the bidders were traceable or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed enlightenments were missing, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.
Often the discrepancies were only marginal, for example by indications of changes in market prices or increased material costs.
Construction services said detecting and detecting mixed calculations was difficult.
In the case of a call for tenders from an institution of public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% lower than the previously determined estimate of these services.
Further calculation tests or studies on the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a reconnaissance interview, the issuing body found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
This left unclear whether the estimate calculated was inflated or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another tender, a construction service awarded the contract on an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
It did not lift the tender, citing the non-objective reasoning that this company could be limited to an adequate calculation.
Suspected irregularities
In the case of a certified construction administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the leading specialist supervisor.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so the issuing body excluded both bids from the proceedings.
In applying the remaining rules, the audits did not reveal any material complaints.
NKcomo
Aptitude test
In many of the construction projects audited, including higher education, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents. Or could not prove their suitability to the extent prescribed. On the other hand, in a case, a awarding body could neither substantiate nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.
rating
When awarding construction services to a water treatment plant, the awarding authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria when reviewing and evaluating the bids.
In a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authority did not determine the weighting of the evaluation criteria until the start of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the prescribed criterion "shortening of the construction phase" was misregarded in a procedure.
As a result, the shortening offered was inadequately taken into account among the second and third positions of bidders.
Documentation of offer selection
In three procurement procedures in the context of housing promotion, the awarding body did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the awarding authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The rules for the examination and evaluation of the offers in both countries are in line with the EU's requirements.
However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective rules differ from each other.
In Germany, the procedure is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be examined.
In both countries, some of the audited procurement procedures found that substantial procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of bids were not or only inadequately documented.
Without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are encouraged.
A particularly serious deficiency was the handover of all offers to third parties, without the contracting authority having checked and documented the offers sufficiently beforehand and thus protecting them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If public authorities have tasks carried out in the examination and evaluation of the offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased amount of control are required to countering the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified set of instruments, inadequately examining the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly in the aptitude test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the procurement procedure
After the examination and values of the offers, the procurement procedure is concluded by issuing the award or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
Companies have the option of examining the intended allocation in the event of an electronic notification or by fax within 10 days or in the case of other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, initiating an inspection procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before this information period expires.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for examination within the information period, a conclusion of the contract is only possible after the final decision in the examination procedure.
Companies may also have the procurement decision reviewed by an independent court in the context of this review process.
The verification procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of the companies and to encourage the client to comply with the law of the contract throughout the procurement process.
To do so, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the issuing authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client is to place the order within the announced surcharge period,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound by their bids after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open proceedings or public and limited tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer at the time of conclusion of the contract.
The losing bidders must be informed in a timely manner about the award decision and the reasons for not taking into account their offers.
Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, for example if the offer prices are inflated or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15-day information and waiting obligation before the award of the contract is also subject to the construction services not to be allocated throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to EU-wide awards.
In the case of the other proceedings in Germany, bidders cannot be informed of the award decision until the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be set aside if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been counted.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the terms of the tender and is economical.
Key exam results
BRH
In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few cases of complaint when the procurement procedures were completed.
In some cases, companies in EU-wide awards received order letters before the expiry of the information periods, which may lead to the invalidity of the contract.
In individual cases, order letters after open procedures also contained different content from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the clients did not comply with the award deadlines.
In the case of an open proceedings, a awarding agency therefore awarded the contract on the second cheapest offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to provide the services at the price originally offered. Run.
NKcomo
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the awarding body in the contract deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.
In the case of some awards, for example construction of road maintenance, construction of a motorway and a bypass, the awarding authorities concluded the contracts after the legal deadline.
In awarding construction services for the rehabilitation of former military premises, the awarding authority did not forward the notification of the award of the contract until after the statutory deadline had expired to all bidders.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements for the completion of the procurement process.
Legal protection of the losing applicants or bidders increases the scope of corruption prevention.
In Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to include awards below EU thresholds.
In both countries, exceedances of the time limits for placing the order were observed.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Building authorities should avoid the deficiencies identified in the completion of their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting requirements
The procurement procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the justifications of the individual decisions.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the orders granted must be made known.
Order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption By documenting procurement procedures, a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement is implemented.
Carefully and promptly produced documentation only makes it possible to understand the procurement decisions.
In particular, it also serves to provide bidders with effective legal protection in the case of procurement above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to substantiate procurement decisions in detail significantly narrows the scope for manipulation.
The notice of a given contract at an EU-wide procurement procedure must be submitted to the EU Office of Official Publications within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The awarding authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces an annual EU statistic to provide it with an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts placed is not limited to EU-wide awards, but also extends to the other procurement procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide awards, there is only a requirement for publication in the case of limited tenders and free-handed awards from the value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros excluding sales tax (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these value limits as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the order allocations.
Key exam results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as to justify product specifications or to refer to national regulations.
In the case of a procurement procedure, the awarding body did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer had not included any evidence to be made.
In a few cases, the documents of the procurement authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Announcements about order sales
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the awarding authorities failed to make the placing of the contracts known.
Further procurement procedures lacked evidence that the awarding agencies had made the contracts awarded known.
Reporting and reporting requirements
The statistical statements included the minimum data required. They had been created on time and sent.
Ex-post-transparency
In most cases, the audited building administrations published the order data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a construction administration did not disclose this data due to a transmission error.
The construction administration only noticed this error after half a year,
So that the order data of the procurement procedures completed so far have not been made public.
NKcomo
Documentation
In the construction work for the hosting of a major sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures had considerable shortcomings. These were mainly incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements about order sales
For several road projects, announcements of contracts awarded were only published belatedly or not at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line in both countries and implement EU requirements.
This ensures the transparency of procurement procedures, including the procurement divisions, in principle.
The regulations to be applied for publication in the Czech Republic go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The deficiencies identified in the documentation and announcements partially limited the orruption-preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Building administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and procurement departments and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKcomo and the BRH have focused on two areas that are essential for the awarding of construction services by public authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: The application of EU procurement rules and the Anti-corruption prevention.
The requirements of EU law allow cross-border competition to create a European single market.
Anti-corruption measures do not only serve to avoid or at least reduce corruption. They are also intended to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit knowledge of the two Court of Auditors on the application of procurement legislation in both countries and the comparison of these rules reveal the similarities and differences that have been made for both countries in the further development of their Procurement law and its application can be helpful.
Application of EU procurement rules
The EU's rules on the awarding of construction services have transposed both countries into national law.
In this way, there is an important common basis in the Czech Republic and Germany for the allocation of construction services and the consideration of the essential commandments of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and transparency. The procurement procedure.
Some of the building administrations of both countries have underpelled these commandments very extensively by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely also transferred the requirements for EU-wide construction services to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the studies carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to remedy the complaints identified when implementing the EU requirements.
The audits in the Czech Republic have highlighted, above all, risks affecting the economic viability of the awards.
For example, incomplete performance descriptions necessitated additional services, often awarded in violation of legislation. In addition, the cost investigations were usually inadequately prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of possible bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport buildings.
Anti-corruption prevention
The investigations have not been aimed at detecting corruption cases,
It is also because the Court of Auditors do not have the appropriate instruments for this purpose.
However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the allocation of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities in the prevention of corruption.
Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unlimited competition and transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech rules are aimed primarily at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of anti-corruption, which the entire federal administration has to apply, apply.
These principles are also implemented in the requirements for the allocation of construction services and are geared towards their specific requirements.
Some of the relevant rules specify very precisely how the anti-corruption bids should be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the BRH's view, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the allocation of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (in particular the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures are also effective measures to address corruption and Prevent manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not see any fundamental need for change to the relevant requirements of the administrations when awarding construction services.
The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The deficiencies identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some requirements.
Building administrations should continue to train their staff on the corruption prevention requirements and raise awareness of this issue.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, delegating tasks increases the risk of abuse.
Tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against undue interference.
NKcomo
The Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption at government level, in which the area of public procurement is the most important component.
The procurement law and the related implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The audits of the NKcomo took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, as the procurement authorities have the cost-effectiveness of the procurement departments, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of the Justify qualification requirements, the key assessment criteria and the nature of the assessments and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
In principle, the NKcomo and the BRH take a positive view of the implementation of the EU's requirements.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's commandments of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for awarding construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and idealistic potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both Court of Auditors see the building authorities in their countries as called upon to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation. And, if necessary, to improve.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously investigated for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to be able to take appropriate countermeasures.
Comparing procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures provide a wider area for competition and can significantly mitigate the risk of corruption.
It can also have a positive impact on supply prices if construction services are shared more favourably in lots, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of the procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient procurement of public contracting.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the construction administrations specialising in this. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks carry out â€“ with the exception of the transport construction projects â€“ the departments themselves or contractors contracted by them.
The Court of Auditors of both countries are anxious, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the knowledge that is important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both Court of Auditors also believe that the principles of public procurement law and its implementation set out in this report are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI). The principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure the economic allocation of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
