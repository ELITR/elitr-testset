Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
Public procurement of services is of great importance both to the state and to the economy.
The role of the State is to use public funds in the most economical and economical way possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the procurement of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.
In order to be able to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities will have to comply with EU rules when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Under the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to decide how to award public contracts.
The provision of services is also an area prone to corruption.
Due to the generally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and improper favours in the awarding of their contracts.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits both on the EU-wide award of construction services and on the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law, which is transposed into national legislation, and on the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction, road and transport infrastructure contracts.
Procurement below the EU thresholds has also been included in the considerations with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both Court of Auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits, which he carried out in 2011 / 2012 with the building authorities, which are responsible for the construction of roads and the construction of the federal government in Germany.
For example, he examined the construction of motorways as well as large construction projects.
In addition, the Bundesrechnungshof used results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on test knowledge from 2008 to 2011. The tests covered construction activities in road construction, rail construction, water construction, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is mainly carried out by the construction authorities of the Länder.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, procurement is carried out on a decentralised basis by those bodies that make use of state budgetary resources.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in sub-sectors of procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, account must be taken of differences in procurement law and in the market structure for construction services in both countries.
Building the public procurement system in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is defined in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures, which are limited to national areas, are governed by budgetary law and administrative rules based on it.
In addition, there are many additional individual rules for both EU-wide and national public procurement through internal administrative provisions,
such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the statutory requirements are supplemented or more precisely formulated in accordance with the case law of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and the other statutory provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The law on public procurement was substantially amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the handling of public funds, allowed greater competition and limited the possibility of corruption in the procurement process.
Broad principles of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure apply in particular to EU-wide awards.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold are subject to national tendering methods (public tendering, limited tendering, freelance procurement), which broadly correspond to the EU-wide tendering methods mentioned above.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for awards to be carried out throughout the EU) and the principle of the public tender (for national awards).
In the open procedure and in the public tender process, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction project into specialist and partial units.
The individual allocation of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable for construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure, where a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, contains provisions to conclude contracts where competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public purchasers and shares of tendering types in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to EUR 307 billion.
Of this amount, EUR 45.5 billion were spent on public works (15%), which, in addition to the construction of the Federal Building, includes in particular the construction activities of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in the construction of high-rise buildings and trunk roads (excluding rail construction and waterworks) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of orders for construction services in the construction and road construction sectors of the federal government was distributed on the types of tenders in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders, and 6.6% negotiation procedures and freeholders.
Of these, 33.2% were pan-European awards.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic in 2011 amounted to EUR 4.7 billion, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to EUR 7.8 billion, representing 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of contract for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiation procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the 2.7% threshold other procedures
The data relate to all public procurement contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement agencies in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries are aimed at a significant part of public procurement, that the prevention of corruption to be observed in all awards is of great financial importance and that the open procedure and public tendering are of paramount importance in awarding the contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Court of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both Court of Auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and in Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.
The main findings were as follows:
The EU Directives on the award of construction services by public authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nr. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the anti-corruption provisions of both countries also serve to prevent corruption, with partial differences in their priorities and details (no. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement of the tender documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for an appropriate bid to be made.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not contain any restrictions on betting or advertising.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it remains a problem to adequately determine the object of the contract.
In Germany, construction work should be divided into lots as far as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
NKÚ found in its audits, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Restrictions on market potential can lead to substantial cost increases and risk price or other agreements.
In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted to provide additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (no. 4.1).
Most of the requirements for setting the type of tender have been complied with in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the primacy of the open procedure in the case of EU-wide procurement or of the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure in the case of national procurement, is enshrined in law and budget law.
This will allow more companies to bid.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes it more difficult for bidders to collude on prices and produces the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected order value is an essential basis in the choice of the correct procurement method.
In Germany, cost databases are used for cost investigations in public buildings, in particular in the construction sector,
based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
Preliminary information and announcements are to be published in the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to prepare for the planned awards at an early stage.
As a rule, the audited building authorities complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (no. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be high enough to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed in advance.
In addition to the EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries are to switch as often as possible among the companies to be challenged in the selection of candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed guidelines in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations failed to take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interests of fair competition, it is necessary to ensure that the same information is given to the companies interested in submitting an offer during the tender period.
A contact between these companies with each other and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The relevant regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited building authorities in Germany partially failed to comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
In both countries, particular attention should be paid to the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency when opening offers.
The requirements for marking, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are defined in particular detail in Germany.
The tests in both countries yielded only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by requirements for the organization of training and leave.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, awarding agencies passed on offers for review to third parties without having to look through the offers beforehand and to document conspicuous features sufficiently.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (no. 4.7).
At the end of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the intended award before it is awarded.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities not comply with the prescribed deadlines in the awarding of contracts or deviate from the content of the bidders' offer (no. 4.8).
Documentation of tendering procedures was not always complete or comprehensible to the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notices of some procedures.
Also, some of the identified shortcomings diminished the corruption-prevention function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (no. 4.9).
Fundamental principles of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition with the free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted inter alia the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 Member States.
The general tendering principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the principle of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive lays down specific rules for construction works to be carried out across the EU.
In order to do so, the estimated volume of orders must reach or exceed the current EUR 5.000.000.
The provisions concern in particular the content of the tender documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia, for the receipt of the bids, the documentation of the tender procedure, the requirements that may be imposed on the qualifications of the applicants, and the Directive on the right of appeal, which forms the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, interested undertakings may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.
Preventing corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
which, as a rule, is initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
In the area of the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public procurement, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
They will have to review the structure and organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to ensure that they are adequately protected against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally considered to be a particularly sensitive area of work to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery as well as the taking and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
For the prevention of corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration. Thereafter, the following principles must be observed for the procurement sector in addition to the risk analysis: primacy of public tenders and open procedures, more eyes and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, award and billing, precise and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
In 2011, the competent Federal Ministry for Public Procurement introduced an electronically supported control system in the area of national highways,
with the award data - such as the estimated costs and the order amounts - as well as data on the participating freelance workers are collected throughout the country and evaluated for conspicuous differences.
Corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law in the Czech Republic.
The legal requirements for transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, form the main basis for the prevention of corruption.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Government has set out anti-corruption measures in an anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures it recommends have already been transposed into national procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions 14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are as follows: lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, the obligation to notify the award office beforehand, including the reasons for tendering, the prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in open procedures and thus the elimination of the possibility of selecting tenderers by lottery, the introduction of the obligation to publish the tender documents and all annexes, and the introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the different phases of the procurement procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents The tender documents must contain all the information the bidders need for an appropriate bid.
In particular, the procurement documents must allow for accurate calculation.
Bidders must not be entrusted with risks that they cannot calculate.
The procurement documents consist in particular of the description of the services and the contractual conditions.
They also contain the requirements to prove the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria which are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are addressed in particular to technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.
The performance description must be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the performance description is only permissible under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the tender documents must be avoided, as it opens up room for speculation in the preparation of the bids and for manipulation in their valuation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules In both countries, EU legislation on technical specifications has been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be advertised in a product-neutral manner without factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must, as a rule, be subdivided into performance units with the respective quantities detailed.
Here the prices are to be agreed on the basis of power units (e.g. B. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the performance descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services where it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation according to lump sums or time spent is to be avoided if possible.
The aim of these provisions is to prevent speculation and manipulation based on undefined requirements in the procurement documents.
The descriptions of services must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders shall not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Different rules for Vonn
There is no obligation in the Czech Republic to tender for construction services in lots.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, public procurement agencies can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are generally divided into lots, separated by the quantity (partial) and / or by type or subject (skilled).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition, to increase the number of possible suppliers and to make it more difficult for them to collude on prices.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
Valuation criteria in the Czech Republic must be indicated in the procurement documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
The aim is to make it completely and conclusively clear to the applicants by which criteria their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only mandatory in the case of EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be set out in an internal administrative award note.
Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, may not contain references to these offices or involved planners or surveyors in Germany with the civil engineering and some road construction administrations.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge about the contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send out procurement documents or to submit planning documents for inspection.
The client is the sole contact of the companies.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic on this matter.
Additional or modified services that prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) almost always accrue to large construction projects.
In both countries, the legislation allows, to a certain extent, supplementary contracts to be awarded to the company already contracted, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary services may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services may not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% for awarding such contracts without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of a delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already contracted company, according to the regulations in Germany an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is not possible in principle.
When determining the remuneration for the additional services, it is rather to be assumed that the agreed prices and the basis for calculating the price of the order that has already been awarded are the same.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset with additional supplementary services.
Key test results
BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Tuesday said it was ready to send more troops to Afghanistan to help combat the Taliban insurgency that has killed more than 1,000 people in the past two years.
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by pan-European standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, joint bands or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was eligible.
Performance directories broken down by partial performance
The BRH has not found in any of the procedures examined breaches of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of the performance descriptions
In the vast majority of the procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some procedures, the tender documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the power directories contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A performance list for demolition work even consisted almost half of such demand positions.
Loose and evaluation criteria
Many awards lacked the required justification for why the services, which were predominantly advertised for the skilled unemployed, were not further divided into part-unemployed.
There were no complaints in the indication of the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelance workers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender."
In the field of construction in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the above-mentioned complaints mainly to the omissions of the freelance workers assigned to prepare the performance descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement process for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the performance description.
The awarding authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
Suppliers and products were also specified in the tender for the construction of several university buildings.
Performance descriptions with power units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly state the scope and nature of the required services in the service descriptions.
As power units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of the performance descriptions
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were amended four times during the period August to September 2009,
since the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary engineering investigations and incomplete design drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the description of the performance of the interior did not contain requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction activities into partial contracts or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded on a one-off basis, savings of up to EUR 31.6 million would have been possible at a total cost of EUR 620.3 million.
Six different buildings, which were the subject of a single contract alone, could have saved EUR 2.5 million (25%) if they had been awarded on a one-off basis.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded on a one-off basis, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When awarding construction works in road construction, the central procurement authority set very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.
In an open procedure for the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the bidders to prove, among other things, that at least three road projects worth EUR 28 million had been carried out in the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway involved six separate construction projects, for which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as an eligibility criterion for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. EUR 2.5 billion out of a total of EUR 3.7 billion) were for contracts awarded by a total of five companies which carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 tendering procedures with an order volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even one bidder made an offer.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to substantial cost increases.
Additional benefits
In two cases, when constructing a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures prescribed by law when awarding additional services and did not enter into any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, additional costs were incurred in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to EUR 165.4 million (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several university buildings, some services were not included in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the award was made.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the national procurement law limit of 20% of the original contract value, the contracting authority conducted negotiation procedures with the contracting companies without notification of the award.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation procedures without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the works by EUR 2 million.
The unit prices for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings include:
Based on a sampling of construction projects, NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data by the Federal Ministry of Building.
This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
A summary of the findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the performance descriptions should enable the bidders to calculate and prepare their offers in an appropriate manner,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon afterwards and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for procurement documents are supplemented by rules aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no such requirements, but the publication of the evaluation criteria in non-EU procurement procedures will increase transparency.
The requirements for the description of performance have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, derogations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The German requirement for the formation of lots encourages competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of NKÚ, the awarding of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots may lead to restrictions on the scope of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements imposed on road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a small number of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
In the case of the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
Under EU and German rules, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a public procurement procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This boundary is often crossed,
as the scope of services provided by public contracts is often insufficiently defined.
If the excess exceeds 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Setting the type of contract and taking the EU threshold into account
By determining the method of awarding the contract, the contracting authority determines the size of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the range of possible candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by limiting the number of non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, pan-European tendering procedures are applicable.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of contract, the contracting authority has to take account in particular of European competition and transparency requirements.
If the estimated total order value of the construction services of a project is or is above the current EU threshold of EUR 5.000,000, the construction services are generally to be awarded Europe-wide in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and may award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the relevant lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total order value of all construction contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low a cost to avoid the obligation to award construction services in principle throughout Europe.
As restrictions on competition substantially increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of award method is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the type of award chosen and the examination of the applicability of the EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Different rules for Vonn
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its public works contracts, which are not subject to the EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and non-open procedures, without the decision having to be documented or substantiated. However, other procedures are only possible under certain statutory conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national tenders - the public tendering principle takes precedence. This is determined by the law on budgets and procurement as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of tendering - such as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be justifiably justified and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or of the public call for tenders is intended to ensure that competition is as open as possible, to prevent the possibility of manipulation by focusing on certain tenderers and to make it more difficult for bidders to collude on prices.
The principle of a public tender is a central element in the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected order value is an essential basis in the choice of the correct procurement method.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organisations to determine the likely costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost characteristics for building categories, use units, construction elements or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost characteristics, the estimated order value of a planned project or a construction performance to be awarded can be determined.
In Germany, the corresponding cost databases for road construction have only been used by some building authorities.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road authorities is foreseen.
Contracting agencies in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price assessments of comparable construction projects to determine the likely costs of construction services.
Rather, in most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates made by the financing authority or on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardize cost determination procedures are still in the early stages.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were mandated to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure, construction and expansion works, as well as other cost-related data, in order to enable cost investigations and the regulation of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control,
which will serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key test results BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The surveyed contracting authorities wrote out the construction work largely in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and procurement regulations.
In 2011, 59.5% of the construction services provided by the federal government in the construction sector were advertised publicly or in open procedures.
In road construction, this figure stood at 94.8%.
The choice of non-public tendering methods sometimes lacked detailed reasons as to why the tendering authorities had to deviate from the principle of an open procedure or of a public tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, based on more than 16,000 procurement procedures, the BRH found that the types of non-public procurement, compared with the open procedures and public tenders, have significant disadvantages in terms of competition and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many tenders were submitted to public tenders as in the case of restricted tenders and almost three times as many bids as in the case of freehold tenders.
The study also showed that bidding prices were on average 6% or 10% higher for limited tenders and freeholds than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Building and a National Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement schemes.
The Federal Ministry of Building and Construction even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures in the results of its studies on economic efficiency.
Taking the EU threshold into account
In the case of the construction projects for which they had identified an expected total order amount of more than EUR 5.000,000, the contracting authorities audited generally drew up procurement plans in which they defined the works to be awarded in accordance with EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction work was to be awarded throughout the EU.
It was not possible to avoid the obligation to award EU-wide contracts by underestimating costs.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell short.
During the construction phase, some contracting authorities improperly changed the terms of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures had been maintained.
For most of the construction projects audited, the share of EU-wide levies was generally lower than foreseen under the procurement plan, according to the results.
In some cases, contracting authorities failed to comply with the requirement to tender all €1,000,000 or more of single lots in EU-wide procedures for construction projects above the EU threshold,
and chose national procedures instead.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
Choice of procurement method
In the case of several large construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction work into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual services were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in breach of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In the case of road construction, the existing price databases in this area were only an inadequate instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on construction projects that had just been completed, but there were indications of a lack of efficiency, unnecessary additional performance expenditure or excessive profits for the companies commissioned.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the supply prices of the last few years, but also comparable market prices and indices of price increases in the construction sector.
In the construction sector, the expected order values were based on the estimated cost values of the project architects or on estimates from investors.
The actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was double the later agreed order value, but eight additions during construction led to a cost increase of EUR 2.1 million or 27%.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases during the construction phase also occurring.
In other cases, the bid prices exceeded the estimates and increased during the construction phase.
In the case of the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by EUR 16 million or 22%. In the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs increased disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had expanded by only 12%.
A summary of the findings
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU rules on setting the type of procurement and taking into account the EU threshold, so the respective rules are broadly in line.
However, the priority given in Germany to the open procedure or the public tender goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public tendering procedures, more companies will be able to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of bids and to the most economic results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by ensuring that the field of candidates is not constrained by manipulation-prone provisions of the contracting authority and by making it more difficult for bidders to collude on prices.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts on an open or non-open basis.
According to the latest changes in procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in procedures involving previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the awarding authorities have largely complied with the rules on the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been inadvertently divided up in order to circumvent the rules on the choice of award method.
When the EU threshold was taken into account, errors had to be identified in Germany, which meant that the minimum share of benefits tendered across the EU was below.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution for correctly calculating the estimated costs of construction and construction projects.
Building authorities should, if necessary, carry out further checks to ensure that the requirements for the choice of procurement method and the scope of services to be advertised throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for accurate cost assessments are created.
Preliminary Information and Notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public contractor has to inform interested companies about the planned contracts already in the run-up to the tender.
Advance information and announcements form an important basis for pan-European competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information shall contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are necessary in the case of construction projects where the estimated total order value exceeds or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wishes to shorten the supply periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client is obliged to give binding details of the construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Among other things, he has to make known the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which has been standardised throughout Europe, is to be used.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the contracting authority.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, national notices must not contain any additional information and must only be issued after the text of the notice has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the Notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on prior information and notification into national law.
Different rules for Vonn
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published for works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may not be started until one month after the notification of the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the national Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases the publication of a preliminary information can be waived.
In Germany, no prior information is necessary in the case of non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national tendering procedures, notices for public tenders and competitions for participation must be published on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines before restricted tenders.
In the case of limited tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded from €25,000 are mandatory (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the various construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as there is a significant reduction in the number of construction works divided into lots.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
Preliminary information
The surveyed contracting authorities published preliminary information for all tested construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened the deadlines for offers, even though the 52-day period needed between the dispatches of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were advertised only after the 12-month period of prior information had expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked references to the planned division of construction work into lots.
No announcements were made.
The notices of the audited bodies contained partly CPV codes, which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately capture the required services.
In individual cases, national notices were published earlier or contained more information - for example on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-militant transparency watchdog
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the notifications on its own fee-paying procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the notifications to the free internet portal of the federal government as required.
Samples showed that only one third of the notifications of the audited administration were published on this portal.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
No announcements were made.
In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the public procurement authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it intended to select the bidders.
The awarding authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
Limiting the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in a non-open procedure, either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it intended to assess the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
The awarding authority concluded in its assessment that all six candidates met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The awarding authority's approach was not transparent because at no time during the procedure had it disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure.
Publication of the notices
The awarding authority did not release the tender for the redevelopment of the former military site.
A summary of the findings
The two-stage system of information and notification is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for pan-European procurement, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the area of national procurement:
Selection of candidates for non-public awards
Contrary to public procurement procedures, in the case of non-public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public tendering procedures, the contracting authority has to make a pre-selection of the companies to be invited to submit bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow a limitation of the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are invited to submit bids.
At least three companies are to be invited to participate in the negotiation process with a tender notice.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficient to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed in advance.
The selection of companies to be challenged is a process within the award procedure which is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. by allowing unilateral preferential treatment for certain companies.
In addition, the restriction of competition to a small number of companies also favours possible agreements between candidates.
In both cases, the delivery result may be significantly affected at the expense of the customer.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible tampering, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding authorities should switch between the companies to be challenged as often as possible in the selection of candidates.
Nor must competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.
The awarding authorities are to justify the selection of the candidates and to document the process of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Different rules for Vonn
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three and in the case of freeholder awards, several suitable candidates are to be invited to submit bids.
The new Czech rules make it inadmissible, with the exception of two special areas, to limit the number of bidders in cases of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the more-eyes-principle has to be observed when selecting companies.
If, for example, an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public tender procedure, the management level of the construction service or an agent from the contracting authority will generally have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to determine the final group of undertakings to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the event of manipulative intentions, this could enable wide-ranging collusion between the parties.
The list of companies to be challenged is to be treated confidentially - also with regard to freelancers - and not to be made available to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no regulations on the establishment and keeping secret of candidate lists.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be challenged, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation on this subject.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids in the case of non-public tenders has been met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European-wide procurement procedures for construction services in the construction sector showed that in the case of restricted federal tenders in Germany, the awarding authorities asked an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids and 4.4 companies to submit bids for freeholds.
Business change and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with few suppliers, the awarding bodies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
In particular, they took into account companies that they already knew and which they considered to be proven.
As a reason for this, they stated that in the case of non-public procedures, the suitability of the companies to be challenged should be ensured before the invitation to tender.
The BRH did not find an unlawful restriction on regional tenderers in the non-public tendering procedures, but it found a higher proportion of regional companies than in the case of public tenders.
The awarding authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in the case of non-public procurement procedures was significantly lower on average and therefore, for example, longer access routes were more important than in the case of public tenders.
More-Eyes-Principle and Proposals
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be challenged amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular on the basis of a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of suitable alternative companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to submit bids.
Some samples showed that the candidate lists had been drawn up by freelancers and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves against possible manipulation to the extent required.
Confidential treatment of the bidding lists
At a procurement office, the lists of companies to be challenged were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the envisaged or authorised companies could have been passed on unauthorised and, for example, could have facilitated collusion between these companies.
Documentation of the documentary
The documentation of the procurement procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of candidates.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
Selection of candidates
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders were not informed about the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not indicate how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a random selection procedure for the companies.
However, this approach, which was generally acceptable at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
A summary of the findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special measures to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the "more eyes" principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the exclusive authority of the awarding bodies to propose the companies to be challenged, the German regulations restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech rules, the newly introduced requirement of a largely unlimited number of bidders in cases of non-public procedures can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings showed that some of these benchmarks were not sufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation for an abusive restriction of the field of participants in these cases was not sufficiently reduced.
Public procurement authorities should eliminate the deficits identified in full.
The offer period
The tender period begins with the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, during which the companies can prepare bids on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants may submit their offers until the expiry of the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU rules for this stage of the procurement procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national rules aimed at countering the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the tender phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The tender documents, on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their offers, are to be dispatched only by the awarding authority.
Voluntary workers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to carry out this task.
The awarding authority is responsible for ensuring that all applicants receive the same information during the tender period.
In the event of any ambiguity in the tender documents or any other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers entrusted with the preparation of the procurement documents are not allowed to provide any information.
Contact between the authorised freelancers and the applicants is to be prevented during the entire offer phase.
Freelancers must not be allowed to become a hub of the procurement procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive effects can be established.
Offers sent by post or direct are to be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Offers transmitted electronically have a technical encryption.
Different rules for Vonn
In Germany, the contracting authority may also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
In Germany, the offers received are to be marked with an entrance stamp and immediately, immediately and unopened, are to be sent to an official responsible for custody.
This official must not be involved in awarding the contract.
The offers received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file sign.
The contracting authority shall record the quotation data, including order numbers, as well as the registration and receipt details, in a protocol.
The storage of offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
The examinations at the tender stage focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building management company.
Shipment of procurement documents
The procurement agencies of the audited building management sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and shipped by an external service company.
Freelance workers did not send out procurement documents.
Information given to applicants
For the most part, the audited building management did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and procurement when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, it did not name employees from the procurement office, but from the project managers, as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had prepared the service descriptions.
In some cases, not all applicants received the same information when asked during the offer period.
Marking of offers
With the tested building management all received offers were provided with entrance stamp and entry note.
In the case of some freelance awards, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for the prevention of corruption.
Keeping the offers
Once marked, not all offers were immediately and immediately sent to the custodian, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which every member of staff had access.
Another department had hung a letterbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers received there even stayed overnight.
Since the slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to take incoming offers and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
On the Czech side, no shortcomings were criticised.
A summary of the findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the tender procedure will be prevented in both countries.
In addition, the principle of equal treatment should be upheld by ensuring that all bidders receive the same information.
The regulations for the receipt, storage and secrecy of the offers seem appropriate in order to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the rules in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up the offers
Opening up the offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders are bound to their offers until the expiry of the award period specified by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no specific EU rules governing the opening up of the offers.
However, national anti-corruption rules contain extensive safeguards to protect tenders and competition at this highly sensitive stage of the tendering process.
The "more eyes" principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulations and changes in the submitted offers.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The "more eyes" principle is intended to prevent individuals from manipulating the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.
Bidders can participate in most of the tender procedures on the opening date.
Only offers which were available to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are admitted to the opening.
Deals received late may in principle no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the tender shall be set out in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the bid prices shall be set.
The Minutes are to be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different rules for Vonn
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of the offers.
Volunteers can also participate in this process.
The committee may also be tasked with further phases of the tender procedure, such as the evaluation of the bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.
The head of the negotiations and the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the awarding and processing of contracts in the construction sector.
In the minutes of the opening date, according to the German regulations, in addition to the quotation prices, information about discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or belated offers - are to be noted.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's right to sign are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.
The Czech legislation does not exist.
If only one offer is received during a tender procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must not be returned.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it must be opened up and then evaluated.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
More-Eyes Principle
The certified awarding bodies implemented the requirements of the MultiEyes principle at the opening dates.
They each conducted the opening dates with negotiators and writers, who were not charged with any other award procedures.
However, in the case of freelance contracts of a smaller scope, there have been occasional cases in which freelancers have opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes of the meeting.
The opening of the offers was not always fully documented in the minutes of the opening dates.
In some cases, e.g. the late submitted offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Marking of offers
The awarding bodies examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination marked the offers according to the specifications by perforating with the date of the opening date.
Extensive tests carried out on some beneficiaries of the aid had found insufficient labelling.
However, these awarding bodies changed their labelling practices after the complaint by the BRH.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
The offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the awarding authority only one month after the end of the tender period. Nevertheless, the awarding authority accepted this offer.
A summary of the findings
The rules of both countries for the opening of the offers are in agreement in important parts. They take into account both the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency. Thus, the risks of corruption and manipulation of the opening of the offers can be significantly limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, the safe storage and the secrecy of the offers significantly restrict possibilities for manipulation such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, the agents responsible for the opening of the offers may not carry out any other tasks in connection with the performance to be awarded.
Overall, only a few complaints attest to the high acceptance of the supply opening requirements.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to check and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
It is for him to determine the offer for the award of the award, which is best suited to the requirements of the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
Firstly, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially capable and possess the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies which have been convicted of bribery or fraud offences, for example, are excluded from taking part in the award procedure.
The bids of the non-excluded tenderers are to be examined computationally, technically and economically and to be evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined particularly by the client.
The examination and evaluation of the tenders is a particularly susceptible phase of the tendering procedure.
For example, bidders may be unfairly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
By favoring or discriminating against bidders, the result of the valuation can be inadvertently impaired and thus the establishment of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons entrusted with the examination and assessment meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure that the procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and comprehensible.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries are to be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the suitability of the companies to be presented, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting, are laid down in the notices or in the tender documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After verifying the bidding, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the offers.
The evaluation has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined as soon as possible to determine whether they are complete and whether there are any notices contained in them, e.g. B, which could indicate possible intent to manipulate.
If bidders are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their offers, they shall be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the offers gives an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
Decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Different rules for Vonn
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to the persons directly entrusted with processing.
The review of the offers as well as the computational examination of the offers may only be carried out by the awarding authority.
It shall only employ staff who are not involved in the procurement decision or in the implementation of the measure.
The performance of the further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the awarding bodies.
In the Czech Republic, tendering committees are to be formed for the examination and evaluation of tenders.
The committees draw up scorecards with proposals for tenders.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the awarding of contracts.
If evidence or declarations requested for the submission of bids in Germany are submitted only incompletely, the awarding authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether to give the bidders the opportunity to complete the missing evidence or statements.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, not only the total price but also the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers have to be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder is invited to remove these ambiguities.
If it does not succeed in doing so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on material changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which could result in significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the overall price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Offers with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
If one or more offers fall short of the correct price determination of the principal or the quotation sums of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders shall have to prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders may be cancelled after an economic viability assessment if only offers with unjustifiable low prices are available.
Contrary to German procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused for this reason in the case of offers with prices that are substantially higher than the client's calculation.
If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must report immediately to its professional level of supervision.
The Commission has to decide what measures to take and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office.
For example, in the case of construction services over 50,000 euros, the professional supervisory level must also agree if the contract is to be awarded independently, if the contract is not to be awarded to the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such rules in the Czech Republic.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the tendering procedures examined were in line with the listed requirements.
In the case of some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A recipient of the grant commissioned companies without the required proof of eligibility being complete.
In some cases it was not possible to ascertain whether the awarding authority had taken into account all the award criteria disclosed in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the "price" criterion.
Selection of participants and confidentiality of offers
Some awarding bodies used persons who were not authorised to do so when examining the offers.
Thus, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks which were to be carried out only by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this on the grounds of insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers entrusted with the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was usually also not comprehensible whether the offers for the freelancers were accessible only to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Inspection and computational examination of the offers
Some contracting agencies passed on the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed inspection of the offers and the computational examination itself and documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without the awarding agencies being able to understand this.
In the documents examined, conspicuous features or missing price or product information were partially or only inadequately marked.
Economic performance audits
In a sample in a building administration, three quarters of the tendering procedures examined differed more than 10% from the previously identified estimated costs.
One in 20 tendering procedures has been cancelled because of unreasonable bid prices.
Not all tender audits and discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
Many details were missing, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.
Often the discrepancies were justified only on a blanket basis, e.g. by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building services explained that it is difficult to detect and verify mixed calculations.
In the case of a tender by a public law institution, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined value of these services.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a reconnaissance interview, the contracting authority did not find any evidence of price dumping by the company then commissioned.
As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a "low-cost company" that could neither maintain quality nor meet deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer, the price of which was 35% higher than the value of the cost determination.
It did not lift the invitation to tender, citing the non-factual justification that a reasonable calculation could be made for this company.
suspicions of irregularities
In the case of an audited building management, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the professional supervisory level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical, so that the awarding authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the audits did not raise any significant objections.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
aptitude test
In many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and the extension of the railway network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
The ratings are down.
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take account of the predefined evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the offers.
In the case of a construction project for the extension of the railway network, the awarding authority did not determine the weighting of the evaluation criteria until the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misinterpreted in a procedure.
As a result, the shortening offered was insufficiently taken into account by the second and third-placed bidders.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures in the context of housing development, the tendering authority did not document which criteria it applied and on which basis it had selected the successful tenderer.
In the case of the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the interviews were not documented.
A summary of the findings
The rules for examining and evaluating offers in both countries are in line with EU requirements.
However, the rules differ on the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved.
In Germany, the process is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by means of detailed requirements, in particular regarding the implementation of the "more eyes" principle and the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be assessed.
In both countries, some of the tendering procedures examined showed that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the tenders were not or were insufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the public contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further procedure.
If the contracting authority has the task of verifying and evaluating the offers carried out by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
In assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany have not always made full use of the instruments provided and have not sufficiently examined the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, objections arose mainly in relation to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After verifying and evaluating the value of the offers, the tender procedure will be concluded by awarding the bid or by suspending the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the proposed tendering decision.
Companies have the option of verifying the intended award within 10 days of receiving information electronically or by fax or other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder files a request for a review within the information period, the conclusion of the contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
The companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court in the context of this review procedure.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of the companies and to encourage the contracting authority to observe the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.
To this end, it must provide sufficient documentation of the procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall grant the order within the time limit announced,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the expiry of the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The losing bidders must be informed promptly of the decision to award the contract and of the reasons for not taking their offers into account.
Procurement procedures may only be lifted under certain conditions, e.g. if the bid prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the call for tenders.
Different rules for Vonn
In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15-day information and maintenance requirement prior to the award of the contract also applies to works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of the other procedures in Germany, bidders may only be informed of the award decision after the award has been made.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be set aside if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been assessed.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of a single valuable offer, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economic.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
Only in a few cases were there complaints with regard to the awarding of contracts examined at the conclusion of the procurement procedures.
In some cases, EU-wide procurement contracts have already been awarded to companies prior to the expiry of the information deadlines, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
According to open procedures, order letters also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as amended dates.
In several cases, the purchasers did not comply with the time limits.
In an open procedure, therefore, a contracting authority awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the end of the award period.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
In the case of a construction project in the field of higher education, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in the contract.
In the case of some contracts, for example in the case of road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the statutory deadline.
When awarding works for the refurbishment of the former military site, the contracting authority forwarded the notification of the award to all bidders only after the statutory deadline had expired.
A summary of the findings
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements at the end of the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of the losing candidates or bidders will increase the scope for the prevention of corruption.
Under Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to awards below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Building authorities should avoid the identified shortcomings in the conclusion of their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
Procurement procedures must be documented in a comprehensible way during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and promptly compiled documentation enables the procurement decisions to be traceable.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of the fight against corruption, as the obligation to give detailed reasons for awarding contracts severely limits the scope for manipulation.
The notification of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure shall be sent by the contracting authority to the EU's Office for Official Publications within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities will also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report it to the European Commission via the competent national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission produces an annual EU statistic to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules for documenting and reporting EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different rules for Vonn
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide procurement, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period has been reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for limited tenders and for freelance awards above value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Under these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure will receive information on the award of contracts.
Key test results
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
Documentation of the documentary
A large number of the tendering procedures examined were not fully documented.
The procurement notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the reasons for product specifications or references to national regulations.
In an award procedure, the awarding authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Announcements of contracts
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the awarding authorities failed to publicise the award of the contracts.
In the case of other procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the awarding authorities had publicised the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistics presented contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and sent out on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the order data of the completed tendering procedures.
However, due to a transmission error, this data was not published in the case of a building administration.
The building management noticed this error only after six months,
so that the contract data of the tendering procedures concluded by then were not published.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
Documentation of the documentary
In the case of construction work for the hosting of a major sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements of contracts
In the case of several road projects, notices of contracts awarded have been delayed or not published at all.
A summary of the findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line with those in both countries and implement EU requirements.
The transparency of procurement procedures, including the awarding of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for the publication of notices go a little further than those in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the announcements partially and substantially restricted the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the relevant procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and should fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Comprehensive evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two main areas, which in the Czech Republic and in Germany are essential for public procurement of works: the application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law will enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Corruption prevention measures are not only aimed at preventing or at least reducing corruption; they are also aimed at preventing economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The auditing experience of the two Court of Auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries and the comparison of these rules reveals similarities and differences which may be helpful for both countries in developing their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's rules on the award of construction services into their national legislation.
In this way, the Czech Republic and Germany have an important common basis for awarding works and taking into account the essential competitive requirements, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The building authorities of both countries have, in some cases very extensively, supplemented these bids with further administrative provisions.
The Czech Republic has also to a large extent transferred the requirements for construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building management in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the problems identified in implementing the EU requirements.
In particular, the tests carried out in the Czech Republic have shown that there are risks to the economic viability of public procurement.
For example, incomplete performance descriptions required additional services, which were often awarded in violation of the law. Moreover, cost assessments were generally inadequately prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially in transport construction.
Preventing corruption
The aim of the investigations was not to uncover cases of corruption,
also because the Court of Auditors does not have the necessary instruments for this purpose.
However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken steps to prevent corruption and manipulation in the procurement of works and how these measures are applied.
Both countries have different priorities when it comes to preventing corruption.
In particular, the German rules provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and controls as key elements in the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech rules is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top economic official said on Tuesday that the bloc's economic policy was "not fit for purpose" and that the bloc would not be able to meet its obligations under the bloc's bailout agreement.
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which are to be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
The relevant rules set out, in part, very clearly, the way in which bids for the prevention of corruption must be taken into account in the running of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the awarding of works, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analysis and sufficient controls (in particular the "more eyes" principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
Therefore, the BRH does not see any need in principle to change the corresponding requirements of the administrations for the award of construction services.
The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in sub-sectors have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of certain requirements.
Building authorities should continue to train their staff on the prevention of corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.
However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against unlawful interference.
KNU-TV, KNBC-TV, reported that a woman was killed in the blast, which was caused by a car bomb.
The Czech Republic adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which the area of public procurement is the main component.
The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The audits of NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective measures for improvement, as the contracting authorities will have to justify the profitability of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and will have to document and publish all these aspects properly.
The recommendations include:
The NKÚ and the BRH give a generally positive assessment of the implementation of the EU requirements.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that EU bids for competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideological potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the provision of construction services, both Court of Auditors have called on the building authorities in their countries to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to be able to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
Greater division of building services into lots can also have a favourable effect on bid prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient procurement by public purchasers.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building authorities. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The Court of Auditors of both countries has the concern, even after the conclusion of their joint project, to further develop the findings which are important to them in each case and, if necessary, to refer them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both Court of Auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement as set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the efficient award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
