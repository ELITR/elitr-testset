Public procurement of construction services and anti-corruption measures
Joint report by the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel examinations
Introduction and overview
The awarding of services by contracting authorities is of great importance to both the state and the economy.
The task of the state is to use the public funds as economically and economically as possible, as well as to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to be able to guarantee largely unlimited competition across borders, the contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts from certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU member states have to transfer and apply the EU's public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Under the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The awarding of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the fundamentally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue privileges in the awarding of their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both for the award of construction services across the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
The main focus of the examinations was the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction services in civil engineering, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds have also been included in the considerations with regard to the prevention of corruption.
The audit results of both audit bodies are summarised in the present joint report.
The report will also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Examination areas and verified bodies The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional examinations carried out in 2011 / 2012 by the building authorities responsible for the road and construction of the federal government in Germany.
In doing so, he examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large-scale construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011, which included construction measures in road, rail, water, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other areas of construction in the Czech Republic.
The awarding of federal public contracts in Germany is predominantly carried out by the building authorities of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the state building administration is centrally responsible for the distribution of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, the contracts are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budgets.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved for parts of the procurement process.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries have to be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sector are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions that are based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national contracts,
Such as the so-called "award books" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail, in accordance with the public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the award procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and other legal provisions, which apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was significantly revised in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the use of public funds, increased competition and limited opportunities for corruption in the procurement process.
Guidelines for public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure are to be applied to EU-wide contracts in particular.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are to be applied to the national types of procurement (public tender, limited tender, voluntary award), which, however, are broadly in line with the above-mentioned EU-wide types of procurement.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for contracts to be carried out across the EU) and the public tender (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender process, any interested company can make an offer.
Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction measure into skilled and partially unemployed people.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to take part in the competition.
Both of the above features of German public procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.
In Germany, there are more than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also to be applied to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal regulations in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open procedure and the non-open procedure.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which around 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public contractors and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, €45.5 billion was spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes, in particular, the construction activities of the federal states and municipalities.
The federal government's construction volume in civil engineering and highway construction (excluding rail infrastructure and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the federal building and highway construction sector was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders, and 6.6% negotiation procedures and voluntary contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, equivalent to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of contract for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contract volumes below the 2.7% threshold for other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded in 2011 by public procurement authorities.
The above data show that the parallel audits carried out by both countries focus on a significant proportion of public contracts, which have a major financial impact on the prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts, and that the open procedure and the public tender are of paramount importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries for the EU-wide award of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both audit bodies compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of civil engineering and road construction.
In doing so, they essentially found:
The EU directives on the award of construction services by public authorities have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which are partly different in terms of their focus and detail (no. 3.2).
In both countries, a key requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information needed to make an appropriate offer.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to competition restrictions.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services are to be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
In its examinations, in particular in the field of road construction, the NK found that awarding large-scale services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Reducing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and run the risk of price or other agreements.
According to the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities can, under certain conditions, agree on additional or modified services with the companies already commissioned, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (no. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, applies.
As a result, more companies will be able to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes it more difficult for bidders to arrange prices and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects, whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the prospective contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost investigations of public buildings, in particular in the construction of buildings,
The construction projects that have been completed are based on the evaluations.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction services to be awarded across Europe, preliminary information and announcements are to be published, which should strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned contracts at an early stage.
The inspected building authorities generally adhered to this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or a lack of controls may have affected competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates to take part in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries are to switch as often as possible among the companies that are to be called upon when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are some very detailed guidelines in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations failed to take account of these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always understandable (no. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interests of fair competition, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in making an offer receive the same information during the tender period.
Contact between these companies and with freelancers involved in the creation of the service description must be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited building authorities in Germany, however, did not comply with these requirements in some cases (no. 4.5).
In opening up the offers, both countries must pay particular attention to the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency.
The requirements for the identification, documentation, storage and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The examinations in both countries resulted in only a few complaints (no. 4.6).
In both countries, the assessment and evaluation of the offers are determined by guidelines for the organisation of construction and procedures.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over offers for testing to third parties without having to look through the offers beforehand and sufficiently document the abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (no. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies participating in the competition will be informed of the intended assignment before the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases the contracting authorities did not comply with the prescribed deadlines for the orders or deviated from the bidders' offer in terms of content (no. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in respect of the award notices of certain procedures.
Some of the identified defects also diminished the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries have largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
The basics of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unlimited competition within the European Union with free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the award coordination and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States of 8.
The general award principles of the European Union are, in particular, the requirement for competition, the requirement for equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the requirement for transparency.
To achieve these goals, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for construction works to be awarded across the EU.
In order to do so, their estimated order amounts must reach or exceed the current amount of 5,000,000 euros.
The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of the offers, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of the applicants, and the appeal directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, affected companies can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union's directives into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
Which is usually prompted by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of global economic output.
In the area of the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, anti-competitive agreements or unfair behaviour can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they will have to review the organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption there.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the susceptibility of decision-making to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works services is generally considered to be a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption 12 in the Federal Administration. According to this, in addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be observed: Priority for public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, award and settlement, accuracy and complete documentation of the award procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the public procurement legislation.
In 2011, for example, the responsible Federal Ministry of Public Works introduced an electronically supported control system in the area of federal highways.
The award data - such as estimated costs and order sums - as well as information on the freelancers involved will be collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also being prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements for transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, form the most important basis for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has set out anti-corruption measures in a anti-corruption strategy paper for 2011-2012 and updated them for 2013-2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement laws and related administrative provisions.
The main provisions of the new legislation are as follows: Lowering the threshold for smaller contracts, requiring the contracting authority to disclose the contracts beforehand, including naming the reasons for the tender, prohibiting the restriction of the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus removing the possibility of selecting bidders through locking procedures, introducing the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, introducing the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Results of the examination of the individual phases of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information that the bidders need to make an appropriate offer.
In particular, the procurement documents must make it possible to calculate correctly.
In so doing, bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The contract documents consist, in particular, of the service description and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders, as well as the criteria that determine the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The service description must, in principle, be product-neutral.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding restrictions on competition in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the procurement documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of the offers and for manipulation in the evaluation of them.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Similar or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
The services are, in principle, product-neutral without the requirements of the factory.
In the performance descriptions, the individual services must, as a rule, be subdivided in detail into performance units with their respective quantities.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. euros per square metre or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the performance descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services where it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation based on lump sums or on time is to be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified requirements in the procurement documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to make their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Divergent rules
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in Losen in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement authorities can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are basically to be divided into lots, separated according to the quantity (partial) and / or according to type or subject areas (non-skilled).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to expand the number of potential suppliers and to make it more difficult to arrange prices.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, assessment criteria must be set out in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This should allow applicants to fully and conclusively identify the criteria on which their offers should be assessed.
In Germany, the specification of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the assessment criteria must only be set out in an internal administrative award notice.
Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or consultants in Germany for the building construction and for some road construction authorities.
This is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge of contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send procurement documents or to interpret planning documents for inspection.
The only contact person for the companies is the client.
There is currently no provision for this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which turn out to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (additions), are almost always required for large-scale construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award additional contracts to the company that has already been commissioned, without having to carry out a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary services must not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages, or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to the award of such contracts without a public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the company that has already been commissioned, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible under the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, it is to be assumed that the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order that has already been awarded.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be charged for additional supplementary services.
Key findings of the audit
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral bidding
In individual cases, the performance descriptions included references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, joints or noise protection plates - without the need for this.
In some cases, performance requirements were so accurately described that only one product was eligible.
Performance lists subdivided by partial services
In none of the cases examined has the BRH found any violation of the requirement to write out services in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some cases, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance lists contained positions that did not determine whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such requirements.
Loose and evaluation criteria
In the case of many awards, the prescribed justification was missing as to why the services, which were predominantly advertised for non-skilled persons, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be taken into account in the assessment of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the involved freelancers.
Some of their names were on the cover sheets or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender."
In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities largely attributed the complaints to the failings of the freelancers responsible for drawing up the service descriptions.
The building services pointed to the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
NKthe
Technical specifications and product-neutral tenders In the case of public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the performance description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying it.
In the course of the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the performance descriptions.
As a performance unit, it only indicated the refurbished space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of performance descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were changed four times in the period from August to September 2009 as part of a non-open procedure,
Since the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient technical preliminary examinations and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be commissioned.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not include any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and fitness criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial contracts or the award of partial contracts is not compulsory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded separately, savings of up to €31.6 million could have been made at a total cost of €620.3 million.
In the case of six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, EUR 2.5 million (25%) could have been saved in the event of a separate award.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be awarded separately, savings of €11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
With regard to the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority laid down very extensive reference requirements as fitness criteria.
In the construction of a part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the bidders, in an open procedure, to prove, among other things, that at least three road construction projects, worth 28 million euros each, had been carried out over the past five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway consisted of six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least €480 million over the last three years as an aptitude criterion for the companies.
Two-thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) came from commissions from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a joint venture.
In 46 bidding procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even one bidder made an offer.
The NK pointed out that a narrowing of the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the legal procedures for awarding additional services in two cases, nor did it enter into written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, additional orders were made in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several university buildings, some services were not listed in the procurement documents, although their necessity was already known in the award of the contract.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national public procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without notice.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiation procedures without bidding.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by €2 million.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than those provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a sample of construction projects, the NK found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic was up to €14.6 million.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Building, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take account of the EU's requirements.
They serve both full and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient accuracy of the performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and prepare their offers in an appropriate manner,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon afterwards, and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the procurement documents are supplemented by regulations that are intended to further reduce restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency will be increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for describing performance have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NK, the award of extensive services without lots, or with only very large lots, may result in restrictions on the provider's field to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow range of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
In addition, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.
When awarding and compensating for additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
According to the EU requirements as well as the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without public procurement procedures.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, until additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation process without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often crossed,
Because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional benefits must be advertised with a public notice.
By splitting services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and the eligibility of the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the number of companies taking part in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by setting a limit on non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures are to be applied.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European legal requirements for competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services must in principle be awarded across Europe in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the principle of Europe-wide award and award works in national contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than €1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason, or deliberately valued at too low a cost, in order to avoid the obligation to award construction services on a Europe-wide basis.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the type of award chosen, as well as the examination of the obligation to apply the EU procurement rules, are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully implemented EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold in national law.
Divergent rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its building contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open procedure and the non-open procedure, without the decision being doctored or justified, but other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national tenders - the public call for tenders are, in principle, a priority. This is determined by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the guidelines for the prevention of corruption.
Other types of procurement - as well as the non-open procedure or the limited invitation to tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by the public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unlimited as possible, to rule out the possibility of manipulation by fixing certain bidders, and to make it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The principle of public tender is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the prospective contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
Construction services in Germany can use the planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost indicators for building categories, utilization units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost indicators, it is possible to determine the expected order value of a planned ramp-up or construction performance to be awarded.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few building authorities in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction authorities is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price surveys of comparable construction measures to determine the likely cost of construction services.
In most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates from the financing body, or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardize cost-assessment procedures are still in their early stages.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to draw up a database of standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This database will collect information on material expenditure and construction and development works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable cost assessments and provisions for unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects in order to better control costs,
Which is to be used as a benchmark for setting prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key audit results BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The audited contracting authorities largely signed off the construction services in an open procedure or in a public tender procedure, thus following the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the construction services of the federal government were advertised in public or in open proceedings.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
When selecting non-public tender types, there was a lack of in-depth justification as to why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tender.
In a cross-cutting investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that the non-public types of contracts have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders, and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many bids were submitted for public tenders as for limited tenders and almost three times as many offers as for freelance contracts.
The investigation also found that the offer prices for limited tenders and free-to-air tenders were on average 6% and 10% higher, respectively, than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations carried out by the Federal Ministry of Building and a State Court of Auditors confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public types of contracts.
As a result of its research into economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of construction projects for which they had calculated an estimated total order sum of more than €5,000,000, the audited contracting authorities generally set out procurement plans in which they set out the construction services to be awarded in accordance with the EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction services were to be awarded across the EU.
Circumventing the obligation to deliver across the EU by underestimating costs could not be ascertained.
However, in part as a result of incorrect calculations, there has been a de facto reduction in the minimum proportion of EU procurement procedures.
During the construction process, some contracting authorities improperly changed the terms of their procurement plans.
They did not substantiate these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures remained in place.
For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide deliveries according to the settlement results was usually lower than planned under the procurement plan.
In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold,
Instead, they chose national procedures.
NKthe
Selection of the type of award
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated value of the order
In the field of road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an inadequate instrument to be able to determine the expected value of the contract.
The data was based on construction projects that had just been completed, but in which there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance costs or excessive profits for the commissioned companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increases in the construction sector.
In the construction sector, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the repositories, or on estimates from investors.
The actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the refurbishment or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the value of the contract agreed upon later, but eight additions in the course of the construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros, or 27%.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, which also led to cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
In the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, costs rose disproportionately, at 139%, as the utility area had only expanded by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented EU rules on how to determine the type of contract and how to comply with the EU threshold into national law, which is why the respective rules are broadly in line with each other.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the field of application by the client's susceptible to manipulation, and by making it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender procedure in Germany.
Under Czech law, contracting authorities can award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes to the public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in cases involving previous competition.
As a result, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender procedure. In the Czech Republic, some services have been unlawfully allocated in order to be able to circumvent the requirements for the selection of the type of award.
When the EU threshold was reached, errors had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a reduction in the minimum proportion of benefits declared across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is not yet a satisfactory solution in order to be able to accurately determine the expected costs of construction services and construction projects.
If necessary, the building authorities should ensure, through further checks, that the requirements for selecting the type of contract, as well as the scope of services to be awarded across the EU, are complied with, or that the conditions for accurate cost assessments are created.
Advance information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded across Europe, the public contractor has to inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for a Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information is intended to contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client is required to provide further details on the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements, as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
The vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardized across Europe, is to be used in the description of the subject of the order.
Preliminary information and notices will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the client's procurement profile.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices at the national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union after the notice has been sent.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the notice may affect competition and, if necessary, may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully implemented the EU legal requirements for advance information and notification into national law.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements are also to be published in the case of construction services that are not to be sold across Europe.
Procurement procedures may begin at the earliest one month after the advance information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
It is only in exceptional cases that the publication of a preliminary information can be dispensed with.
In Germany, no advance information is required in the non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions must be published on the Federal Government's Internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines, before limited tenders.
In the case of limited tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small size of the detached building contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as there are significantly fewer construction services being divided into lots.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded across Europe.
However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the deadline for offers, even though the 52-day period required between the pre-information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of prior information had already expired and before it had been extended.
In the case of many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned distribution of construction services in lots.
Announcements
The notices issued by the audited bodies contained some CPV codes that deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or that did not accurately cover the required services.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information - for example, on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
The company published the reports on its own fee-based procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the reports to the Federal Government's free internet portal, as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited administration's reports were published on this portal.
NKthe
Announcements
When constructing a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority was not able to prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in any open procedure either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it would assess the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to allow to compete.
In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The contracting authority's approach was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of the notices
In the case of the renovation of former military sites, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage education system, with advance information and notice, is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
In contrast to public procurement procedures, not every company interested in carrying out the services to be awarded will be able to compete in the non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a selection beforehand as to which companies should be invited to submit tenders.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow for a limit on the number of applicants for EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are required to submit tenders.
At least three companies are to be invited to take part in the negotiation procedure with the announcement of the contract.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed beforehand.
The selection of demanding companies is a process within the procurement process that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be given one-sided preference.
In addition, restricting competition to a small number of companies also favours possible agreements between candidates.
In both cases, the result can be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this step in the process.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, when selecting candidates, the contracting authorities are to switch as often as possible among the companies that are required to do so.
Nor should competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The contracting authorities have to justify the selection of the candidates and document the course of the selection process in their award notices.
Divergent rules
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three candidates are to be invited to submit offers, and in the case of voluntary tenders, several suitable candidates are to be invited to submit offers.
Under the new Czech rules, it is inadmissible - apart from two specific areas - to limit the number of bidders in the event of open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eyes principle is to be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or a commissioner from the contracting authority generally have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and / or supplementing a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to definitively determine the circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested is to be treated confidentially - even with regard to freelancers - and not to be made available to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no appropriate regulations for setting up and keeping secret lists of applicants.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be asked to do so, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory loophole in Czech legislation in this regard.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to bid for non-public contracts has been met, with only a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in civil engineering showed that the contracting authorities charged an average of 6.6 for limited tenders by the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for tenders in the case of voluntary contracts.
Switching companies and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with a few suppliers, the contracting authorities did not always change the circle of selected candidates.
They took into account, above all, companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they would have to ensure the suitability of the companies that are required to compete before the invitation to submit an offer.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction on regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but it did find a higher proportion of regional companies than in the case of public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this primarily to the fact that, on average, the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is much lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.
More eyes and proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to change the proposed list of companies to be required by an independent person.
They justified this, in particular, with a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies that had been asked to make the offer.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the list of candidates and that these proposals had been accepted by the contracting authorities unchanged.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves from possible manipulation to the extent required.
Confidential handling of bidding lists
In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the planned or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and could, for example, have enabled agreements to be made between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only a few reasons for selecting the candidates.
NKthe
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive any information on the assessment criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not contain any information on how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In a trial, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
As a result, the award committee carried out a procedure for selecting the companies.
However, this procedure, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidders' lists and the exclusive authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be charged, the German regulations restrict such opportunities for abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement for the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can, in particular, counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been poorly implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings that have been identified.
Bidding phase
With the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, the bidding phase begins, during which the companies can draw up offers on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants will be able to submit their offers until the deadline set by the contracting authority has expired.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement process.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the offer phase.
These are, above all, organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The procurement documents, on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their offers, are, in principle, only to be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the procurement process are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the tender period.
In the event of ambiguity in the award documents or other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers commissioned to draw up the procurement documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelance workers must not become a hub of the procurement process, through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Offers sent directly or by mail must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have to show a technical encryption.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers secret and to comply with the contractual obligations in a conscientious manner.
The offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp in Germany and must be sent immediately, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.
This official may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority records the quotation data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt information in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
The tests for the offer phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building management department.
Dispatch of the procurement documents
The contracting authorities of the inspected civil engineering administration sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send tender documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the inspected building management did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and assignment when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the requirements, she did not name employees from the contracting authority, but rather from the project management as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even included the names of the freelancers who had produced the performance descriptions.
In case of enquiries during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of offers
In the case of the inspected building management, all the offers received were provided with an entrance stamp and an entrance note.
However, in the case of some freelancers, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for the prevention of corruption.
Preservation of the offers
According to their identification, not all offers were immediately and immediately received by the custody officer, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, in a construction service, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which each employee had access.
Another department had hung up a mailbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers made there remained overnight.
Since the insertion slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate incoming offers.
NKthe
No defects were reported on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the bidding phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.
In addition, by providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should be respected.
The rules governing the receipt, storage and confidentiality of the offers appear suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and made public.
From the opening date, the bidders will be bound by their offers until the deadline set by the contracting authority has expired.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal provisions for opening the offers.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement process, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive requirements to protect bids and competition.
The multi-eyes principle, as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer, are intended to prevent manipulation and alterations to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The opening date is to be carried out by a number of persons to be appointed by the contracting authority.
The multi-eyes principle is designed to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers unchecked when opening the offers.
Bidders will be able to take part in the opening ceremony for most of the bidding procedures.
Only offers that have been submitted to the negotiator at the opening of the first offer are allowed to open.
In principle, late offers may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices must be recorded.
The protocol must be read out and signed by the negotiating committee.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is carrying out the opening of the bids.
Freelancers can also play a part in this.
The committee can also be tasked with further phases of the award process, such as the evaluation of the offers.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary are carrying out the opening of the offer.
The chief negotiator must be an employee of the contracting body.
The chief negotiator and, in the case of contracts in the building, also the writer should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the award and contract processing.
According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date also contain information on discounts and discounts, as well as special features - such as damaged or delayed offers - in addition to the offer prices.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer as well as the signature authority of the applicant will be recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to those directly responsible for the processing.
Czech regulations do not exist.
If only one bid is received in a tender procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it must be opened and then evaluated.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
More-eyes principle
At the opening ceremonies, the audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and writers who were not charged with any other award treatment.
However, there have been a number of cases where freelancers have opened offers sent to them without the involvement of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offerings was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered, and in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of offers
The contracting authorities examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination identified the offers in accordance with the requirements by perforating them with the date of the opening date.
In the case of long-term tests carried out by some beneficiaries, insufficient markings had been found.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practices following the complaint by the BRH.
NKthe
Deadline for bidding
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the expiration of the offer period. Nevertheless, the contracting authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The rules of both countries to open the offers agree in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation in opening the offers can be significantly limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict the possibility of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, the officers responsible for opening the offers are not allowed to perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
All in all, only a few complaints demonstrate the high level of acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, he has to determine the offer for the award of the contract, which is best suited to the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-level procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders has to be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that are legally convicted of fraud, for example, for bribery, must be excluded from participating in the award process.
The offers made by the non-excluded bidders are to be examined in a computational, technical and economic manner and assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the award process.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the result of the valuation can be unacceptably impaired and thus the determination of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure that the procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and verifiable.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
In line with the requirements of the EU, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the companies' proof of aptitude to be presented, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting, are laid down in the notices or in the procurement documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
Once the bidding has been verified, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined immediately as to whether they are complete and whether, for example, they contain abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the valuation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to those directly responsible for processing.
The inspection of the offers as well as the computational examination of the offers can only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It will only have to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of the further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in more detail.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They are only allowed to make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, procurement committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the offers.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with proposals for contracts.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the contracts.
If evidence or declarations requested for the submission of the bid in Germany are only incompletely filed, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiration of the deadline, the offer must be excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is up to the contracting authority to decide whether it will give bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, it must be ruled out.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers are also to be examined.
If, as a result of the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so, and if the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of prices, this offer must be ruled out.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
In Germany, a surcharge may not be awarded on offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more offers fall short of the correct price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders have to prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are not able to do so, the contracting authority may rule out the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after an assessment of profitability if there are only offers that cannot be justified at low prices.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused in the case of offers with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation for this reason.
If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its technical supervisor at the leading level.
It has to decide what measures to take and whether to inform the Antitrust Authority or the Public Prosecutor's Office.
For example, the technical supervisor must agree to more than 50,000 euros for construction services, if a contract is to be awarded freely, if a contract is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price, or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the requirements set out above.
In the case of some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A beneficiary commissioned companies without the required proof of fitness being fully available.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision, or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the people involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to examine the offers for this purpose.
For example, freelance workers or staff involved in planning or carrying out a construction project carried out tasks that could only be carried out by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient staffing capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers charged with examining the offers also worked with employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to comply with the contractual obligations in a conscientious manner.
For the construction services, it was mostly not clear whether the offers for freelancers were only accessible to those directly responsible for processing.
Review and computational examination of the offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without first having carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself, and having doctored their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties would have been able to make changes to the offers without this being understandable to the contracting authorities.
In the documents examined, abnormalities or lack of price or product information were in some cases not marked, or only insufficiently marked.
Performance examinations
In the case of a sample in a civil engineering administration, the cheapest offers for three quarters of the audited procurement procedures deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs.
One in 20 bidding procedures has been cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.
Not all of the bidding tests and enlightenment discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, there was a lack of more detailed information, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
In many cases, the deviations were only generally justified, for example by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
Construction officials said it was difficult to detect and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of a call for tenders from an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously estimated value of these services.
Further calculations or examinations of the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In an enlightenment interview, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then commissioned company.
As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was too high or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "low-cost company," which could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer, the price of which was 35% higher than the value of the cost assessment.
She did not cancel the call for tenders, citing the non-factual justification that this company could be concluded on a reasonable calculation.
Suspicions of irregularities
There have been two cases of irregularities in an audited building administration, both of which have been reported to the technical supervisor.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a call for tenders, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the remaining regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant objections.
NKthe
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the offers.
In the case of a construction project to expand the railway network, the contracting authority only determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road conservation measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the proposed reduction was insufficiently taken into account by bidders in second and third positions.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three procurement procedures in the context of housing development, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it had selected the successful bidder.
During the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions alone.
Examinations of this selection were not possible, as the interviews were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for testing and evaluating the offers in both countries are in line with the requirements of the EU.
However, with regard to the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ from each other.
In Germany, the process is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be assessed.
In both countries, in some of the procurement procedures examined, it had to be established that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the offers were not, or were not, sufficiently documented.
However, without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions will be encouraged.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the public contracting authority having sufficiently examined and documented the offers beforehand, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If public authorities have tasks carried out by third parties in the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments, and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly during the aptitude test as well as in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the award procedure
After testing and valuing the bids, the award process will be completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
The companies have the possibility to examine the intended award in the case of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or with other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder makes a request for a review within the information period, it is only possible to conclude a contract after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of the companies and to encourage the client to comply with the public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
In order to do this, he has to document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client is to issue the order within the announced deadline for the award of the contract,
This is also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client must not, in principle, deviate from the content of the offer at the time of conclusion of the contract.
The inferior bidders must be informed of the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account in a timely manner.
Tendering procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, for example if the offer prices are excessive or if the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, the 10-day or 15-day obligation to provide information and maintenance prior to the award of the contract also applies to construction services that are not to be awarded across Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide distribution.
In the case of other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract.
In the Czech Republic, an award procedure has to be repealed if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been evaluated.
In Germany, the surcharge must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it meets the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
In the case of verified contracts, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies have already received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the end of the information deadlines, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
According to open procedures, contract letters also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the award deadlines.
In the case of an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the expiration of the contract period.
NKthe
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
In the case of some contracts, such as road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts at the end of the legal period.
When awarding construction services for the refurbishment of former military sites, the contracting authority only directed the announcement of the award of the contract to all bidders after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements at the end of the procurement process.
The legal protection of the inferior candidates or bidders will increase the instruments for preventing corruption.
In Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, building authorities should avoid the shortcomings that have been identified in the completion of their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures are to be documented clearly during their individual stages in view of the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data will also be recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption Through the documentation of the procurement procedures, a basic requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement is implemented.
A carefully and promptly prepared documentation makes it possible to trace the award decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for bidders for contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to substantiate procurement decisions in detail significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure has to be sent to the EU Office for Official Publications within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, which also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data from their procurement procedures and report it to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission draws up annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully implemented the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide contracts, there is an obligation to publish only in the case of limited tenders and in the case of free-to-air contracts from value limits of 25,000 euros and 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure will receive information about the orders.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the procurement procedures examined were not fully documented.
The award notices did not include all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In the case of an award procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, although its offer did not include mandatory proof.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.
Notices on order assignments
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publicise the awarding of contracts.
In further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had disclosed the contracts that had been awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistics obtained contained the required minimum data, which had been prepared and sent out on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, in the case of a building administration, this data was not published due to a transmission error.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
As a result, the contract data of the procurement procedures completed up to then have not been published.
NKthe
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly in the form of incorrect information, such as incorrect quotation prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Notices on order assignments
In the case of several road construction projects, announcements about contracts awarded were only delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The rules governing documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are broadly in line in both countries and implement the EU's requirements.
In principle, this ensures the transparency of the procurement procedures, including the assignment of contracts.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The shortcomings in the documentation and notices revealed significantly limited the preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and assignments and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits carried out by the NIC and the BRH have focused on two main areas, which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of construction services by public authorities: The application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only designed to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two audit courts on the application of the public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these regulations, provide insights into the similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements for the award of construction services into national law.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and in Germany, there is an important common basis for awarding construction services and for taking into account the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of the procurement procedures.
The building authorities in both countries have, in some cases, largely backed up these bids with additional administrative provisions.
The Czech Republic has also largely transferred the requirements for the construction services to be awarded across the EU to its nationally adjustable procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, investigations carried out by the audit bodies have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building authorities in Germany should further improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to be able to remove the complaints that have been raised in the implementation of the EU requirements.
In particular, the tests carried out in the Czech Republic have highlighted risks that affect the cost-effectiveness of the contracts.
For example, incomplete performance descriptions required additional services, which were often awarded in violation of legislation. In addition, cost surveys were mostly insufficiently prepared, and excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the transport sector.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations have not been aimed at exposing cases of corruption,
This is also because the courts of auditors do not have the appropriate instruments to do so.
However, the audit courts can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the awarding of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
When it comes to preventing corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unlimited competition, as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of the procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of the prevention of corruption apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations set out very precisely how the anti-corruption bids should be taken into account in the course of the award process and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analysis and sufficient controls (in particular the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures, are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not see any fundamental need for changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations for the award of construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the requirements.
The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the requirements for the prevention of corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Manipulation and corruption-prone tasks should therefore only be assigned to third parties if the administration is able to guarantee a sufficient level of protection against undue interference.
NKthe
The Czech Republic has adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which the area of public procurement is the most important element.
The Procurement Act, as well as its implementing provisions, have been substantially amended.
The tests carried out by the NK were carried out during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential assessment criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and must properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NAC and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU guidelines.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both audit bodies consider that the building authorities in their countries are required to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks, in order to be able to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures can provide a wider scope for competition and significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction services into lots can have a favourable effect on the offer price, provided that it achieves greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring that procurement procedures are carried out correctly is an essential basis for efficient awarding of contracts by public authorities.
In Germany, procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised construction authorities, while in the Czech Republic, these tasks - with the exception of transport construction projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The audit courts of both countries have the concern to continue to develop the relevant findings for them, even after the completion of their joint project, and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both audit bodies are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
