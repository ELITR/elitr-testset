Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report by the Supreme Supervisory Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both to the state and to the economy.
The task of the State is to use public funds in the most economical and economical way possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure that competition is largely unrestricted across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, EU member states must transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Under the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
In view of the generally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits when awarding their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Supervisory Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both for the award of construction services throughout the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law transposed into national rules, as well as on the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
Procurement below the EU thresholds has also been included in the consideration with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both audit bodies are summarised in the present Joint Report.
The report will also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Examination areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests carried out in 2011 / 2012 at the construction administrations responsible for the road and construction construction of the federal government in Germany.
In doing so, he examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011, which included construction measures in road construction, rail infrastructure construction, water construction, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the award of the public contracts of the federal government is carried out predominantly by the construction administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the public works administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budget resources.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved in parts of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and in the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Building up public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sphere are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national contracts, many complementary individual rules are laid down by internal administrative rules,
such as the so-called "procurement books" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in accordance with the case law of public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the award procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the management of public funds, allowed for increased competition and limited the scope for corruption in the award procedure.
Broad outlines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure have to be applied to EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold are subject to national types of procurement (public tendering, limited tendering, freelance procurement), but these are largely in line with the above-mentioned EU-wide types of procurement.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for contracts to be carried out throughout the EU) and the public tender procedure (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public call for tenders, any interested company can make an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
For this purpose, the main purpose is to divide an overall construction measure into specialist and partial persons.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures must also be applied to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
In line with EU law, Czech public procurement rules provide for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.
Of this, €45.5 billion was spent on public construction (15%), which includes, in addition to federal construction, in particular, the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in construction and long-distance road construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and water construction) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the construction and long-distance road construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders, and 6.6% negotiation procedures and freelance contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide contracts.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to €4.7 billion in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was EUR 7.8 billion, which corresponded to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011:65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contract volume below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant proportion of public contracts, that the prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts is of great financial importance and that the open procedure and public tendering are of paramount importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the award of construction services throughout the EU and on the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both Court of Auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits carried out, in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.
In essence, they found that:
The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also served by the procurement rules of both countries, which differ in part in their priorities and in their detail (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the award documents is that they contain all the information necessary for the proper preparation of a bid.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to competitive advertising restrictions.
In Germany, the award documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the object of the contract sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services must be divided into lots as far as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, the NKÚ found, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of large services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Restrictions in market potential can lead to significant cost increases and pose a risk of price or other collusion.
In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, in principle agree with the companies already contracted additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective benchmarks for determining the type of award have been largely followed in both countries.
Under the Czech Republic's rules, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure applies to EU-wide contracts or to the public tender procedure, which corresponds to the open procedure in the case of national contracts.
As a result, more companies can make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price fixing between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations awarded the construction services in principle throughout Europe.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost assessment of public buildings, in particular in the construction sector,
based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
In the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published, in order to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to anticipate the planned contracts at an early stage.
The audited building administrations usually complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries should switch as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed requirements in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interests of equal competition, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in bidding receive the same information during the bidding phase.
As far as possible, contact between these companies and with freelancers who have been involved in the preparation of the service description must be avoided in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The relevant regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, some of the audited building administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
In opening up bids, the principle of multi-eye and transparency must be observed in both countries in particular.
The requirements for the labelling, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The audits in both countries showed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by requirements for the organisation of construction and processes.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over offers for examination to third parties without looking through the offers beforehand and adequately documenting abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were not sufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the end of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the parties to the competition will be informed of the proposed contract prior to the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to comply with the prescribed deadlines or deviate from the offer of the bidders in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the award procedures was not always complete or comprehensible by the audited building administrations in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Some of the identified shortcomings also reduced the corruption-prevention function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directives and the Remedies Directives, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 Member States.
The general tendering principles of the European Union are, in particular, the requirement for competition, the requirement for equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the requirement for transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for works to be awarded throughout the EU for construction projects.
For this purpose, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed a volume of currently 5,000,000 euros.
The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the adherence to deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be imposed on the qualifications of applicants and the Remedies Directive provides the basis for the legal protection of applicants and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
Importance of the prevention of corruption
In both countries there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for the private benefit,
which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices can jeopardise confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public contracting authorities.
In doing so, they will have to review the organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
In principle, the award of public works is considered to be a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has adopted a Directive and Recommendations on the Prevention of Corruption 12 in the Federal Administration.
In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
In 2011, for example, the Federal Ministry responsible for public procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,
with the award data, such as the estimated costs and the order amounts, as well as information on the freelancers involved, are collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The statutory imperatives of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, are the most important foundations of the prevention of corruption.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech government has identified anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on anti-corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions 14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are the lowering of the thresholds for smaller contracts, the obligation to notify contracts in advance by the contracting authority, including the reasons for tendering, the prohibition of restricting the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus the elimination of the possibility of selecting bidders through batch procedures, the introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, the introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the different stages of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement Documents The award documents must contain all the information that bidders need to make an appropriate bid.
In particular, the award documents must make it possible to calculate correctly.
In doing so, bidders must not be entrusted with risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The contract documents consist in particular of the service description and the contract conditions.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria governing the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law for the award documents are based in particular on the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
In principle, the performance description must be product-neutral.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permissible under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of the prevention of corruption.
In addition, ambiguous or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as it opens up scope for speculation in the preparation of tenders and for manipulation of their valuation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules In both countries, the EU legal requirements on technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be advertised product-neutral without factory specifications.
In the performance descriptions, the individual services must as a rule be broken down in detail into performance units with respective quantities.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
The performance descriptions must in any case be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation by lump sum or by time is to be avoided as far as possible.
The purpose of these provisions is to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the award documents have been finalised.
Different rules
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public contracting authorities can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services must in principle be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and / or by type or specialist areas (skilled persons).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to compete, to increase the number of potential suppliers and to make price fixing more difficult.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical as a rule.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be indicated in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
The aim is to ensure that applicants are fully and definitively aware of the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be set out in an internal procurement notice.
In Germany, contract documents drawn up by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or reviewers at the civil engineering and some road construction administrations.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client about the contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) are almost always incurred in the case of large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of supplements to the already contracted company without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU requirements and the German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% for an award without a public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already contracted company, according to the regulations in Germany, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible.
The calculation of the remuneration for the additional services must be based on the agreed prices and on the basis of the price determination of the order already awarded.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset with additional supplementary services.
Key audit results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical authorisations or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related requirements - for example, for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection plates - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was eligible.
Performance directories subdivided by partial services
In none of the cases examined, the BRH has found breaches of the bid to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the award documents had been finalised before the start of the tenders.
In some cases, the award documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance directories contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
In fact, almost half of a list of services for demolition work consisted of such needs.
Loses and evaluation criteria
In the case of many awards, the prescribed justification was missing as to why the services, which were mostly advertised according to the skilled, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no objections to the indication of the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on issues of tendering."
In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the reported complaints mainly to the omissions of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the performance descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral call for tenders In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
In the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the call for tenders.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the performance descriptions.
As performance units, it only stated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of performance descriptions
For the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were changed four times in the period August to September 2009 under a non-open procedure,
as the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary structural examinations and incomplete design drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not contain any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high quality equipment.
Loses and aptitude criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded separately, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible with a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, for six different buildings that were the subject of a single contract alone, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved if they were awarded separately.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded separately, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
In the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority set very extensive reference requirements as aptitude criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the bidders, in an open procedure, to prove, among other things, at least three road construction projects carried out, worth 28 million euros each from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects, for which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least €480 million over the last three years as an aptitude criterion for the companies.
Two-thirds of the funds allocated to road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. €2.5 billion out of a total of €3.7 billion) were contracted by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even one bidder submitted an offer.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.
Additional benefits
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures for the award of additional services in two cases and did not enter into written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, supplements were incurred in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several higher education buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the award was awarded.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit set by national public procurement law of 20% of the original contract value, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without notifying them.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation procedures without a call for tenders.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The uniform prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a sampling of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly in line in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for sufficient determination of the performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and draw up their offers in an appropriate manner,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon afterwards and also reduce speculative leeway.
In Germany, the common basic requirements on procurement documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
There are no such requirements in the Czech Republic, but transparency will be increased by the publication of the evaluation criteria in non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for the description of services have been largely met in both countries.
In some cases, however, derogations have had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The existing requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots may result in restrictions on the range of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
In addition, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
Regulatory approaches differ in both countries when it comes to the award and remuneration of additional or modified services.
According to the EU and German rules, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a public notice procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess exceeds 20%, the additional services will have to be advertised with a public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority determines the size of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by specifying non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account in particular the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services must in principle be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, derogate from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than €1,000,000 and that the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all works contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to deprive it of the obligation to award construction services throughout Europe in principle.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the type of award chosen, as well as the examination of the obligation to apply EU public procurement rules, are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Different rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle of equal status of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision being doctored or justified, but other procedures are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national contracts - the public tender procedure takes precedence in principle, as laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of award - as well as the non-open procedure or the limited call for tenders - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be comprehensively justified and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public call for tenders is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by fixing certain bidders and to make possible price fixing between bidders more difficult.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects, including cost parameters for building categories, units of use, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost indicators, the expected order value of a planned advance or a construction performance to be awarded can be determined.
In Germany, some construction administrations only have corresponding cost databases for road construction.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price investigations of comparable construction measures to determine the projected costs of construction services.
On the contrary, in most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates by the financing body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure and construction and extension works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable cost investigations and regulations of uniform prices.
In order to better control costs, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects,
which will serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Main audit results BRH
Election of the award procedure
The audited contractors wrote out the construction services to a large extent in the open procedure or in public tender and thus complied with the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services in the construction sector were advertised to the public or in an open procedure.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
The choice of non-public contracts lacked some detailed justifications as to why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public tenders have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many offers were submitted in public tenders as in limited tenders and almost three times as many offers as in the case of freelancers.
The investigation also showed that bidding prices for limited tenders and freelancers were, on average, 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Building and a State Court of Auditors confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public types of procurement.
As a result of its studies on profitability, the Federal Ministry of Building even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of the construction projects for which they had identified an estimated total order amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans in which they determined the construction services to be awarded in accordance with EU wide and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction services were to be awarded across the EU.
It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award contracts across the EU through overly low cost estimates.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum share of EU procurement procedures actually fell short.
During the construction process, some contracting authorities unduly changed the definitions of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures was still respected.
For most of the construction measures audited, the share of EU-wide contracts according to the billing results was usually lower than envisaged under the procurement plan.
In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities failed to comply with the requirement to tender all €1,000,000 or more comprehensive individuals in EU-wide procedures,
and instead chose national procedures.
NKÚ
Choosing the type of award
In several major construction measures, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sports event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several partial contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these breakdowns, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In the field of road construction, the existing price databases for this area were an inadequate instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data was based on recently completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance costs or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the expected order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by the investors.
The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimated values.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight supplements in the course of the construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27%.
Similarly, the actual value of the contract for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases during the construction phase.
In other cases, the offer prices exceeded the estimated values and increased during construction.
For the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%; for the construction of a judicial building, the cost increased disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had only expanded by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU rules on setting the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold, which is why the respective rules are largely in line.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public call for tenders in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the field of candidates by setting the client susceptible to manipulation and by making price fixing between bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the merits of the primacy of the open procedure or of the public tender in Germany.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in previous competition procedures.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements on the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been allocated inadmissibly in order to circumvent the requirements on the choice of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be found in Germany, which led to a reduction in the minimum proportion of benefits advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the projected costs of construction services and construction projects.
Building administrations should, where appropriate, carry out further checks to ensure that the requirements for selecting the type of award and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with, or that the conditions are created for appropriate cost investigations.
Preliminary information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned contracts in advance of the call for tenders.
Pre-information and announcements are an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information will contain the main public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are necessary for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wants to shorten the tendering deadlines for open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the contracting authority must provide binding details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of performance, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes), which is unified throughout Europe, must be used.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the contractor.
In order to avoid penalising foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be published after the notification text has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the Notice may affect competition and may even encourage manipulation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU's pre-information and notice requirements into national law.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may start at the earliest one month after sending the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of prior information be dispensed with.
In Germany, no prior information is required for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions must be published before limited tenders on the Internet portal of the Federal Government and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of limited tenders without competition, announcements of services to be awarded above 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small part of the detached construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as there are significantly fewer construction services divided into lots.
Key audit results
BRH
Pre-information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information for all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened offer deadlines, although the 52 days required between the submissions of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the 12-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked indications of the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcement
Some of the notices of the audited bodies contained CPV codes which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information - for example on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
It published the notifications on its own paid award platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the notifications to the free internet portal of the federal government as required.
Samples showed that only one third of the audited administration's notifications were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Announcement
In the case of the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in a non-open procedure, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to assess the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to allow to compete.
In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six applicants complied with the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time of the procedure.
Publication of the announcements
During the refurbishment of former military grounds, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage system of pre-information and publicity is an important part of implementing the requirement for transparency in Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU benchmarks and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public types of award
In contrast to public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can compete in non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a preliminary selection of which companies should be invited to bid.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow for a limitation of the number of applicants in non-public procurement procedures across the EU.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies must be asked to bid.
At least three companies must be invited in the case of negotiation procedures with a contract notice.
In any case, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be made known beforehand.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the award procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by unilaterally favouring certain companies.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible collusion between applicants.
In both cases, the award result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should switch as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
In addition, competition must not be limited to companies established in certain regions.
The contracting authorities have to justify the selection of candidates and to document the course of the selection process in their award notes.
Different rules
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three and in the case of freelancers, in principle, several suitable candidates must be asked to submit an offer.
Under the new Czech rules, apart from two specific areas, it is inadmissible to restrict the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or a contractor from the contracting authority will usually have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and / or supplementing a new company.
The aim is to prevent an individual from being able to definitively determine the number of companies to participate in the competition.
Otherwise, in the event of manipulation, this could allow for far-reaching collusion among the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially, including vis-à-vis freelancers, and not made accessible to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no such rules on the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.
Under the German rules, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory loophole in Czech legislation on this.
Key audit results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to bid for non-public contracts has been complied with, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in construction construction showed that the contracting authorities asked an average of 6.6 companies to bid for limited tenders by the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for freelance tenders.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially in the case of trades with a few suppliers, the contracting authorities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
In particular, they took into account companies already known to them and, in their view, tried and tested.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies that were required to compete before they were invited to bid.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that, on average, the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.
Multi-eye principle and proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies requested to bid.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of candidates and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
In this way, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent required from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidder lists
In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system, which could be viewed by all the staff of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the envisaged or authorised undertakings could have been passed on unauthorised and could, for example, have allowed for collusion among these undertakings.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only a few justifications for the selection of candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of candidates
When building a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive any information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not contain any information on how the selection of applicants should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a batch procedure for selecting the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of applicants in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the bidder lists and the sole power of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech rules, in particular, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in the case of non-public procedures can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should fully address the shortcomings identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the call for tenders, the tender phase begins, during which companies can draw up tenders on the basis of the award documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their offers until the expiry of the offer period set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU rules for this phase of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities must comply with the national rules designed to counteract the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the tendering phase.
These are, above all, organisational requirements and controls.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
In principle, the award documents on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their bids must only be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the tender phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the award documents or other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers entrusted with the preparation of the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the contracted freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelancers must not become a hub of the award procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Offers submitted by post or directly submitted must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Offers sent electronically have a technical encryption.
Different rules
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously comply with the contractual obligations.
In Germany, the offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp and sent directly, immediately and unopened to an official responsible for custody.
This official may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority shall record the quotation data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt information, in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not regulated in more detail in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
The bidding phase audits focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a civil engineering administration.
Delivery of the award documents
The contracting authorities of the audited building administration sent the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send award documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the audited building administration did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and award when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the performance descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting office, but from the project managers as contact persons.
Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had compiled the performance descriptions.
In the case of inquiries during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of offers
At the audited building administration, all offers received were provided with entrance stamp and entrance note.
In the case of some freelancers, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for preventing corruption.
Preserving the offers
According to their identification, not all offers immediately and immediately reached the person responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, in a construction service, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which every employee had access.
Another service had hung up a letterbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which the offers thrown in there sometimes even remained overnight.
Since the throwing slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff, but also visitors to the service, would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate the offers received.
NKÚ
No shortcomings have been objected to on the Czech side.
Summary findings
In particular, during the tendering phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process will be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment is also to be respected.
The rules on the receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers seem appropriate in order to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are slightly more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed breaches of the rules in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up of offers
Opening up of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, the bidders will be bound by their bids until the expiry of the award period set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU rules for the opening of tenders.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be determined by the contracting authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when the offers are opened.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can take part in the opening date.
Only offers submitted to the negotiator at the opening of the first offer are allowed for the opening.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions carried out and the results of the opening of the offer must be set out in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the price of the offer must be recorded.
The Minutes are to be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of offers.
Freelance workers can also participate in this.
The Committee may also be entrusted with other phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an official of the tendering body.
The head of the negotiations and, in the case of contracts in construction, also the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the award and contract processing.
According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features such as damaged or delayed offers must be recorded in the minutes of the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signatory power of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date, they must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
There are no similar Czech regulations.
If only one offer is received during a tendering procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany, and if only one offer is received, it must be opened up and then valued.
Key audit results
BRH
Multi-eye principle
The audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who were not entrusted with any other award procedures.
In the case of freelancers, however, there were occasional cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late submissions were not registered, and in individual cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of offers
The contracting authorities examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination marked the offers according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
Insufficient labelling has been found in past audits of some beneficiaries.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the tendering period, but the contracting authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The two countries' rules on the opening of bids coincide in significant parts, taking into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency, which can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of bids.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the labelling, the safe custody and the secrecy of the offers significantly restrict the possibility of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those entrusted with the opening of tenders may not carry out any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The only few complaints in total prove the high acceptance of the requirements for opening up the supply.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, it must determine the offer for the award of the contract, which best meets the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU benchmarks provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that are legally convicted, for example, of bribery or fraud, must be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The offers of the non-excluded bidders must be examined in mathematical, technical and economic terms and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client must determine the most economically advantageous offer, and the client must examine offers with unusually low prices in particular.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly susceptible phase of the tendering process.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvancing bidders, the value result can be inadmissibly impaired and thus the determination of the economically most favourable offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons entrusted with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and of the decisions taken.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the proof of suitability of the companies to be presented, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.
After checking the suitability of the bidding, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating must be limited to the award criteria.
The bids submitted must first be formally examined as soon as possible to determine whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities which could indicate possible intentions of manipulation.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible way.
Different rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly entrusted with the processing.
The inspection of the offers as well as the calculation of the offers may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It will only have to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further audit and evaluation tasks is not regulated in more detail.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required in Germany for the submission of an offer are only incomplete, the contracting authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline must the offer be excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete the missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the uniform prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of too low or too high prices for partial services, the bidder must be asked to dispel these ambiguities.
If he does not succeed in doing so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the quantity of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant increases in the costs of the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Offers with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded a surcharge in Germany.
If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are not able to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders may be terminated after verification of profitability if only offers with unjustifiable prices are available at low prices.
Contrary to German public procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused for this reason in the case of offers with prices significantly higher than the calculation of the client.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must report immediately to its technical supervisor at the leading level.
It must decide on the measures to be taken and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office.
For example, the leading level of specialist supervision must also agree to construction services of more than 50,000 euros if a contract is to be awarded on a voluntary basis, if a contract is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such rules in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the tendering procedures examined complied with the requirements set out above.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A recipient of the grant commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being fully available.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to examine the offers for this purpose.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in planning or carrying out a construction project carried out tasks that could only be carried out by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to examine the offers also participated in employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was also mostly incomprehensible whether the offers from the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Review and computational examination of offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and had doctored their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting parties.
In the documents examined, abnormalities or missing price or product information were in some cases not marked or only inadequately marked.
Performance audits
In a sample in a building administration, the cheapest tenders in three-quarters of the tendering procedures audited deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs.
One in twenty tendering procedures has been terminated because of unreasonable bid prices.
Not all offer audits and reconnaissance talks with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, there was a lack of further information, such as on the uniform prices of the most important positions.
Often the deviations were justified only on a blanket basis, for example by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services said it was difficult to detect and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of a call for tenders by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously estimated value of these services.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a reconnaissance interview, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value determined was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not keep quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the calculation of costs.
It did not suspend the call for tenders, citing the non-factual reasoning that a reasonable calculation could be concluded at this company.
Suspicion of irregularities
In the case of an audited building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the level of specialist supervision.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a call for tenders, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the remaining rules, the audits did not give rise to any substantial objections.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, including higher education, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
Rating
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authority only determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the proposed reduction was insufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third positions.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures in the context of housing development, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Examinations of this selection were not possible, as the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The rules for the examination and evaluation of bids are in line with EU requirements in both countries.
However, when it comes to details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective rules differ.
In Germany, the procedure is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be verified.
In both countries, some of the tendering procedures examined found that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or were inadequately documented.
However, without the traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions will be encouraged.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently examined and documented the offers beforehand and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
When contracting authorities have tasks carried out in the examination and evaluation of tenders by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control burden are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the set of instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose in particular with regard to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After the validation and value of the tenders, the award procedure will be completed by awarding the contract or by repealing the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
Companies will have the possibility to examine the proposed award within 10 days in the case of information by electronic means or by fax or in the case of other means of communication within 15 days, and to initiate a review procedure if necessary.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, a conclusion of the contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court in the context of this review procedure.
The purpose of the review procedure is to ensure the legal protection of the undertakings and to encourage the contracting authority to comply with public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
To do this, he must adequately document the procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The purchaser shall award the contract within the announced contract period,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the expiry of the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer at the time of conclusion of the contract.
The inferior bidders must be informed promptly about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their bids into account.
Procurement procedures may only be lifted under certain conditions, for example if the bid prices are excessive or the tenders do not meet the requirements of the call for tenders.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, there is also a 10 or 15 day obligation to provide information and wait before awarding a contract for construction services that are not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of the other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure has to be terminated if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been assessed.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the conditions of the call for tenders and is economic.
Key audit results
BRH
In the case of the contracts audited, there were only a few complaints when the award procedures were completed.
In some cases, companies received letters of contract for EU-wide contracts even before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
Pursuant to open procedures, order letters also contained content deviating from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the contract deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the end of the contract period.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction measure in the university sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
In the case of some contracts, for example construction measures for road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the legal deadline.
When awarding construction services for the refurbishment of former military sites, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's benchmarks for concluding the award procedure.
The legal protection of the inferior candidates or bidders increases the range of instruments for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law has also been extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Building administrations should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be clearly documented during their individual stages in view of the relevant findings and the justifications of the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data will also be recorded in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and promptly prepared documentation allows only the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for tenderers when contracts are awarded above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to give detailed justifications for award decisions significantly limits the scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent by the contracting authority to the EU Publications Office within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and notify them to the European Commission through the competent national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission draws up an annual EU statistic, which enables it to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU rules on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only in the case of limited tenders and in the case of freelancers contracts with value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without sales tax (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information on the award of contracts.
Key audit results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the tendering procedures examined were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product requirements or references to national rules.
In a tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer had not included mandatory evidence to be submitted.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.
Notices on contract notifications
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to disclose the award of the contracts.
In the case of further award procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had made the contracts awarded known.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical compilations viewed contained the required minimum information, which had been drawn up and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
In the case of a building administration, however, due to a transmission error, this data was not published.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
so that the contract data of the tendering procedures concluded up to that date have not been published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly because of incorrect information, such as incorrect quotation prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Notices on contract notifications
In the case of several road construction projects, announcements about contracts awarded were only published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
This will, in principle, ensure the transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.
The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for notification go slightly further than those in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the notices significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Building administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two priorities which are essential for the award of works by public contracting authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow for cross-border competition in order to create a European internal market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent, or at least reduce, corruption; they are also intended to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two Courts of Auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these rules, provide information on similarities and differences that can help both countries to develop their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's requirements for the award of construction services into national law.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of works and for taking into account the essential imperatives of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The building administrations of both countries have, in some cases, very extensively underpinned these bids by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has also, to a large extent, transposed the requirements for the construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints that have been raised when implementing the EU requirements.
In particular, the audits carried out in the Czech Republic have identified risks that affect the profitability of the contracts.
For example, incomplete descriptions of services required additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation, and cost investigations were mostly inadequately prepared, and excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially in the case of transport buildings.
Prevention of corruption
The investigation has not been aimed at uncovering cases of corruption,
also because the Court of Auditors does not have the appropriate instruments to do so.
The Court of Auditors can, however, examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
In the prevention of corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
In particular, the German rules provide for largely unrestricted competition, as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech legislation is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of the prevention of corruption apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the requirements for the award of construction services and are geared towards their specific needs.
In some cases, the relevant regulations set out very precisely the way in which the bids for the prevention of corruption should be taken into account in the course of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the BRH's view, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the award of construction services, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative intervention.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (in particular the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some benchmarks.
The building administrations should continue to train their staff on the requirements for preventing corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.
Without controls and adequate safeguards, however, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interference.
NKÚ
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which the public procurement sector is the most important element.
The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The NKÚ audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, as the contracting authorities will have to justify the profitability of the contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and duly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU requirements in principle positively.
The broad acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's imperatives of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both auditors see the building authorities in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open proceedings in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction services into lots can have a beneficial effect on bid prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient procurement by public contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building authorities, whereas in the Czech Republic, with the exception of the transport projects, these tasks are carried out by the departments themselves or contractors commissioned by them.
The auditors of both countries are concerned, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to combat corruption effectively and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.
