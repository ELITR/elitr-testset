Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The task of the State is to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure that competition is broadly unlimited across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU guidelines when it comes to awarding them from certain value limits (thresholds).
For this purpose, EU member states must transfer and apply EU procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also a vulnerable area.
In view of the generally high potential for damage, contracting authorities must therefore implement appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue benefits in the award of their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both for the allocation of works across the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
The main focus of the audits was the application of EU procurement law transposed into national legislation, as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in construction and road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds were also included in the considerations with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both Court of Auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Examination areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Court on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests carried out by the construction administrations in 2011/2012, which are responsible for the federal road construction and construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major building projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction measures in road construction, rail infrastructure construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the public procurement of the federal government is mainly carried out by the construction administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for public transport infrastructure awards.
In the construction sector, the awards are carried out decentralised by those bodies that use state budget resources.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in sub-sectors of procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Development of procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procedures limited to the national field are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national awards, many supplementary individual schemes are provided by internal administrative provisions.
such as the so-called “Vergabehandbücher” of the Federal Government, in which the statutory requirements are supplemented or further formulated in accordance with the law of public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and other statutory provisions applicable both above and below the EU thresholds.
Public procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new regulation strengthened transparency in the use of public funds, allowed greater competition and limited the possibilities for corruption in the procurement procedure.
Broad lines of procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure shall apply in particular to EU-wide awards.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold apply the national types of procurement (public tender, limited tender, hands-free award), but which largely correspond to the aforementioned EU-wide types of procurement.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of prioritisation of the open procedure (in the case of procurement to be carried out throughout the EU) and the public tender (in the case of national procurement).
In the open procedure and in the public tender procedure, any interested company may submit a tender.
Another key feature of German procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
In particular, the division of a total construction measure into specialist and partial batches is used for this purpose.
The individual allocation of these lots is intended to allow as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies employing 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable for construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law contains provisions in accordance with EU law that require contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is achieved.
Current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow contracting entities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In the Czech Republic there are over 85,000 construction companies, of which about 1,900 companies employing 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of procurement in both countries
In Germany, the total volume of construction in 2011amounted to EUR 307 billion.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros were allocated to public construction (15%), which includes, in addition to the federal construction, the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in construction and long-distance road construction (excluding railway infrastructure construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to EUR 8.5 billion.
The volume of contracts for construction works in the construction and road construction of the federal government was divided among the types of procurement in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiated procedures and hands-free contracts.
Of which 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.
The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic in 2011amounted to 4.7 billion euros, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to EUR 7.8 billion, representing 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011:65.1% Open procedures 14.3% Non-public procedures 9.5% Negotiated procedures 8.4% Simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold 2.7% Other procedures
The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public contracting entities in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant part of public procurement, the prevention of corruption to be observed in all awards is of great financial impact, and that the open procedure and the public tender are an outstanding Posiession
Summary of the results of parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the allocation of works across the EU and on the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both Court of Auditors compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, particularly in the areas of building construction and road construction.
In doing so, they essentially noted:
The EU directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (Nos 1 and 3.1).
In addition to EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also served by the procurement rules of both countries, which differ in their focus and in their detail (point 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information required for an appropriate tender.
The specifications must be neutral and must not contain restrictions on competition.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it remains a problem to adequately determine the subject-matter of the contract.
In Germany, construction works must be divided into lots as far as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the Federal Republic of Germany, this requirement was largely implemented.
In its tests, in particular in the field of road construction, the NKÚ found that the award of large services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Constraints in the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and pose the risk of price or other agreements.
Pursuant to the provisions of both countries, the contracting entities may, under certain conditions, agree, in principle, with the undertakings already commissioned, additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (point 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were predominantly followed in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting entities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure applies to EU-wide procurement or public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national procurement.
This allows more companies to submit offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes it difficult to find prices between bidders and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the estimated value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used to investigate costs for public buildings, especially in building construction.
based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (point 4.2).
In the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and notices must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adapt to the aforementioned awards at an early stage.
As a rule, the audited construction administrations adhered to this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates to participate in non-public procurement procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed beforehand.
In addition to EU requirements, contracting agencies in both countries should switch as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are some very detailed specifications in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, it is necessary to ensure that the interested parties receive the same information during the tender phase in order to ensure that competition is equal to opportunities.
Contact between these companies and with freelancers involved in the drafting of the SOW shall be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited construction administrations in Germany partly did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
In opening up tenders, in particular, the multieye principle and the transparency principle must be observed in both countries.
The specifications for the labelling, documentation, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers are intended to narrow the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The examinations in both countries showed only a few complaints (point 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the tenders are defined in both countries by means of specifications for the organisation of structures and processes.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting entities handed over tenders to third parties for examination without first looking through the tenders and sufficiently documenting abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (No. 4.7).
When concluding the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies participating in the competition will be informed of the proposed contract before the award of the contract.
This legal protection option also has a preventive function against corruptive behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review for non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases the contracting entities did not comply with the prescribed deadlines in the award of contracts or did not give way to the tenderers' tenders' content (point 4.8).
Documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible at the audited construction administrations in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notes of some procedures.
Some of the identified shortcomings also reduced the corruption prevention function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely met their reporting and reporting obligations (point 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU procurement law and prevention of corruption
EU Public Procurement Law
In order to ensure unlimited competition in the free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the Directives on Procurement Coordinating and Appeals, which were to be transposed into national law by the Member States.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, that of competition, the requirement for equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the requirement of transparency.
In order to enforce these objectives, the procurement coordination directive contains specific rules for construction works to be awarded across the EU.
For this purpose, their estimated order amounts must reach or exceed the current amount of EUR 5,000,000.
The rules concern, in particular, the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the compliance with deadlines, including the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements which may be imposed on the qualification of candidates and the Appeal Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, companies concerned may have the decisions of contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.
Corruption prevention
Importance of the prevention of corruption
In both countries there is no legal definition of the term of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a trust to the private advantage.
which is normally initiated by the beneficiaries of those decisions.
Corruption can impede competition and result in significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic performance.
For the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair conduct may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.
In doing so, they have to check the organisation of their administrations for areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the susceptibility of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly vulnerable area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption — in particular bribery and bribery, as well as acceptance and authorization — is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the Federal Administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles have to be observed for the procurement sector: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, basic separation of planning, award and settlement, precise and complete documentation of the procurement procedures.
In addition, other anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the procurement law regulations.
For example, in 2011, the responsible Federal Ministry for Proceeds in the Federal Highway Area introduced an electronically supported control system:
with which procurement data — such as the estimated costs and contract sums — as well as information on the involved freelancers are collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted by criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, form the main basis of the prevention of corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has established anti-corruption measures in a anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated it for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended therein have already been incorporated into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions.
The new legislation essentially includes the following rules: reduction of thresholds for smaller contracts, obligatory prior announcement of the award by the contracting party, including the reasons for the tendering procedure, prohibition of restricting the number of tenderers in non-open procedures and thus abolition of the number of tenderers. Possibility of selection of tenderers by lot procedure, introduction of the obligation to publish the procurement documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Results of the examination of the various stages of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents shall contain all the information that tenderers need for a proper tender.
In particular, the procurement documents must allow for a correct calculation.
In doing so, the bidders shall not be transferred to any risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The procurement documents consist in particular of the specifications and the terms and conditions of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualifications (suitability) of the tenderers and the criteria that are relevant to the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are in particular addressed to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all tenderers and should restrict competition as little as possible.
The SOW must in principle be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the SOW is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding restrictive requirements in the procurement documents is also an elementary principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents must be avoided, since they provide scope for speculation in the compilation of tenders and for manipulation in their evaluation.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations In both countries, EU technical specifications are transposed into national law.
The services are generally product-neutral without any manufacturer specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must normally be subdivided into service units with respective quantities.
The prices must be agreed on on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per unit).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
The specifications of the service shall in any case be complete and unambiguous.
They shall contain precise quantities and shall not include services which do not determine whether they are needed.
Compensation based on lump sums or time expenditure must be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite specifications in the procurement documents.
The specifications must enable tenderers to prepare their tenders safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender shall not be published until the procurement documents have been completed.
Differing regulations
There is no obligation to tender works in lots in the Czech Republic.
Where it is possible by type of service to be recovered, public contracting entities may divide works into several lots.
In Germany, construction works must be divided into lots, separately according to the quantity (partial lots) and/or by type or subject matter (skilled lots).
The aim is to enable SMEs to participate in the competition, increase the number of potential providers and make price arrangements more difficult.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical.
Evaluation criteria must be specified in the procurement documents in the Czech Republic, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
This is intended to be fully and conclusively identifiable for applicants the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required for the EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria shall only be recorded in an administrative award note.
Procurement documents drawn up by contracted freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or appraisers in Germany.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other unacceptable competitive advantages without the client's knowledge of contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send procurement documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (additions) are almost always incurred in large construction projects.
In both countries, the statutory provisions allow, to a certain extent, the awarding of supplements to the already commissioned company without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to such award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the already ongoing construction work.
If additional services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible under the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed must be based on the price.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset against additional supplements.
Significant test results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the specifications contained references to national technical approvals or standards which had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some specifications also included product-related specifications — such as graffiti protection, grout tapes or noise protection panels — without this being required.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product could be considered.
Tables of services broken down by subperformance
In any of the proceedings under consideration, the BRH has not found any breach of the requirement to write out services in a list of services broken down by partial services.
Completeness of the specifications
In the vast majority of procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the invitations to tender.
In some cases, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tendering phase because some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the tables of services contained items where they were not determined whether they were needed.
In fact, almost half of a list of services for demolition work consisted of such demand items.
Lots and evaluation criteria
Many awards lacked the stipulated justification for the reasons why the services advertised mainly according to professional lots were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of tenders.
Information on freelancers
A small part of the specifications contained references to the involved freelancers.
Their names were partly on the cover pages or in attached plans or opinions.
In one case, the contracting party even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect “on questions of the call for tender”.
In the construction sector, in particular, the contracting entities attributed the complaints reported mainly to the omissions of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the specifications.
The construction services referred to the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately monitor the specifications.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, the SOW specified a supplier and a specific product brand.
The authorising company did not allow the use of comparable products without justification.
In the construction of several higher education buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the call for tenders.
Performance Descriptions with Power Units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contractor did not clearly identify the scope and nature of the required services in the specifications.
As performance units, it only indicated the rebuilt space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the specifications
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the specifications of services were changed four times in the context of a non-open procedure during the period August to September 2009;
since the scope of services increased substantially and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient structural preliminary investigations and incomplete design drawings, which had to be commissioned additional services.
When building a large library building, the specifications of the interior design did not contain any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high quality equipment.
Lots and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction projects into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not obligatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that a separate allocation of selected parts would have resulted in savings of up to EUR 31.6 million with a total cost of EUR 620.3 million.
For example, six different structures which were the subject of a single contract could have saved 2.5 million euros (25%) if they were awarded separately.
A separate allocation of 20 bridges would have made savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) compared to a total award.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting entity specified very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
In the construction of a part of a motorway, the contracting body required the tenderers, in an open procedure, for example, to provide proof of at least three road construction projects worth EUR 28 million each from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects in which the contracting authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million in the last three years as a qualifying criterion for the undertakings.
Two thirds of the funds allocated to road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. EUR 2.5 billion out of a total of EUR 3.7 billion) were commissioned by a total of five companies carrying out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with a volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even one tenderer submitted a tender.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting agency did not apply any of the procedures prescribed by law in the award of additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to ambiguous volume and quality requirements, supplements were created in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to EUR 165.4 million (net), thereby increasing the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
ThisSegmentIsIntentionAllyLeftBlank
In the case of several higher education buildings, some services were not included in the procurement documents, although the need for the award was already known.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting entity conducted negotiated procedures with the contracted companies without notice of award.
In the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority retained the right to award additional works in negotiated proceedings without tendering.
During the construction period, the contractor extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
Based on a sampling of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Germany, on the other hand, according to an evaluation of long-term data by the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition as well as the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for sufficient determination of the specifications should enable tenderers to correctly calculate and prepare their tenders,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed subsequently and also limit speculation margin.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for procurement documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing competition restrictions and manipulation possibilities.
In the Czech Republic there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for the SOW have been largely complied with in both countries.
However, in some cases, discrepancies had to be objected, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of large services without lots or with very large lots may result in restrictions on the field of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements in the Czech Republic in road construction have led to public contracts being awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and not allowing small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other arrangements.
In the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.
According to the EU requirements and the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without procurement procedures with public notice.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure without notice.
ThisSegmentIsIntentionAllyLeftBlank
This limit is often exceededing,
since the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess exceeds 20%, the additional services must be tendered by public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Determine the type of award and take into account the EU threshold
By defining the type of award, the contracting entity shall determine the extent of the number of undertakings participating in the competition.
It may leave the range of potential candidates and tenderers, for example by choosing an open procedure, to a large extent unlimited or limit the scope of non-public procurement procedures.
Europe-wide procurement procedures shall apply to construction projects that meet or exceed a threshold set by the EU.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority shall take into account, in particular, the requirements for competition and transparency under European law.
If the estimated total contract value of the works of a project is equal to or above the EU threshold of currently EUR 5 million, the works must be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may, in the case of construction projects reaching or exceeding the EU threshold, derogate to the principle of Europe-wide procurement and award works in national procurement procedures provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots is 20 % of the estimated total contract value of all works contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without imperative reasons or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to allocate construction services throughout Europe.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen award method and the examination of the application of EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on procurement procedures and the threshold value into national law.
Differing regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle of equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction contractions which are not subject to the EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision being to be docued or justified. However, other procedures are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or, in the case of national procurement, the public invitation to tender takes priority. This is defined by budgetary and public procurement law, as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of procurement — such as the non-open procedure or the restricted invitation to tender — are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finalised in public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of prioritisation of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unlimited as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by setting on specific tenderers and to make possible price arrangements between tenderers more difficult.
The principle of public tender is a key element in the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the estimated value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the estimated costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost parameters for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost metrics, the estimated contract value of a planned project or construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Appropriate cost databases for road construction in Germany have only some construction administrations.
However, a nationwide introduction is envisaged for all road construction administrations.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price inquiries of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated cost of works.
In most cases, cost investigations are based on estimates of the financing body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardize cost investigation procedures are still in the early stages.
In the context of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database of standardized building materials and materials.
ThisSegmentIsIntentionAllyLeftBlank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure, construction and finishing works, as well as other cost-relevant data in order to enable cost determination and regulation of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects in order to improve cost control.
which will serve as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Main test results BRH
Choice of the award procedure
The audited contracting entities broadly wrote out the works in an open procedure or in a public tender procedure, thus following the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services in the construction sector were tendered publicly or in open proceedings.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
The choice of non-public procurement types lacked some detailed justifications as to why the contracting entities had to deviate from the open procedure or the public tender principle.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures that non-public procurement types have significant disadvantages in competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of tampering and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted in public tenders as in restricted tenders and nearly three times as many tenders as for freehand tenders.
The investigation also showed that tenders prices for restricted tenders and freehand tenders were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a State Auditing Court confirmed the profitability differences between public and non-public procurement types.
As a result of its investigations into economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even found doubled differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Take into account the EU threshold
As a rule, the contracting entities audited drawn up procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had determined an estimated total contract amount of more than EUR 5 million, in which they set out the works to be awarded by EU wide and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, a share of more than 80% of the works throughout the EU has always been allocated.
It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to allowances across the EU due to low estimates.
However, in part due to incorrect calculations, there was actually less than the minimum proportion of EUwide procurement procedures.
During construction, some contracting entities inadvertently changed the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be respected.
For most of the construction measures under review, the proportion of EU-wide procurement was usually lower than the allocation plan according to the settlement results.
In some cases, for projects above the EU threshold, contracting entities violated the requirement to tender all EUR 1,000,000 and more single lots in EU-wide procedures.
and chose national procedures instead.
NKÚ
Choice of the award type
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting entities divided works into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these breakdowns, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In the field of road construction, the price databases available for this sector were only insufficient to determine the estimated value of the contract.
The data were based on construction projects that have just been completed, but there were indications of lack of profitability, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were around 37% below the estimated order values obtained from the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the estimated contract values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates from investors.
The actual order values were very different from the estimates.
The estimated price for the reconstruction or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later, but eight supplements in the course of construction led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros or 27% respectively.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases during the construction phase.
In other cases, offer prices exceeded the estimates and increased during construction.
When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, the costs increased disproportionately by 139%, as the usable area had increased by only 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed EU rules for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are broadly in line with each other.
However, the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in force in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the competition in public procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is substantially improved by not restricting the field of candidates by the contracting entity prone to manipulation and by making price arrangements more difficult between tenderers.
The investigations confirmed the favourability of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender procedure in Germany.
Czech legislation allows contracting entities to award contracts in open or non-open procedures.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of tenderers in proceedings involving previous competition may no longer be limited.
Thus, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely followed the requirements for prioritisation of the open procedure or the public tender procedure. In the Czech Republic, some services were inadmissible in order to circumvent the rules on the choice of the type of award.
When considering the EU threshold, it was necessary to identify errors in Germany that resulted in lower than the minimum proportion of services offered across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the estimated cost of works and construction projects.
The construction administrations should, where appropriate, ensure that the requirements for the choice of the type of procurement and the scope of services to be advertised throughout the EU are complied with, or that the conditions for appropriate cost investigations are established.
Preliminary information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public contractor must inform interested companies of the proposed contracts in advance of the tendering procedure.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the main public procurement information relating to the planned construction projects.
They are necessary for projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and for which the contracting entity intends to shorten the deadlines for tender open or non-open procedures.
In notices, the contracting entity shall give binding details of the planned works contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
ThisSegmentIsIntentionAllyLeftBlank
Among other things, he has to make known the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the subject matter of the contract, the common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes) is to be used throughout Europe.
Preliminary information and notices shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the contracting entity.
In order to prevent the disadvantage of foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain additional information and may only be issued after the publication of the notice text to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU legal requirements for prior information and disclosure into national law.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may be started no earlier than one month after dispatch of the advance information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the national Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a prior information be waived.
In Germany, no prior information is required for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and competitions before restricted tenders are to be published on the federal web portal and, where appropriate, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded from EUR 25,000 are required (ex-ante transparency).
The preliminary information shall include all planned lots of construction projects.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small scale of the separate construction awards.
In the Czech Republic, this scheme has little effect, as much less construction works are split into lots.
Significant test results
BRH
Pre-information
The contracting authorities investigated published preliminary information on all projects under examination with works to be awarded throughout Europe.
However, in some open procedures, they reduced tenders, although the time limit of 52 days required between the dispatch of the prior information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were put to tender only after the 12-month period of validity of the prior information had expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked any indication of the planned division of works into lots.
Notices
The notices of the audited bodies contained, in part, CPV codes which were not specific to the information provided in the previous information or which did not correctly cover the requested services.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information, such as the deadlines for execution, than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
The latter published the reports on its own paid award platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the free internet portal of the federal government as prescribed.
Samples showed that only one-third of the audited administration reports were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Notices
When constructing a sewage treatment plant, the contractors did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the tenderers.
The contracting party could not demonstrate how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of tenderers was permitted under the law in force at that time.
In the context of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting body did not specify in the notice or documentation of the award procedure that it would assess the qualifications of the candidates and how many candidates it would allow to compete.
The deciding body concluded in its assessment that all six candidates met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time of the procedure.
Publication of notices
At the redevelopment of former military premises, the issuing body did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage education system with prior information and announcement is an important component in implementing the transparency requirement in Europe-wide awards, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU guidelines and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures also in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public award types
In contrast to public procurement procedures, in the case of non-public procurement procedures, not every undertaking interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting entity must first make a selection of which companies are to be invited to tender.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption EU rules allow a limitation of the number of applicants for EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies must be invited to tender.
A minimum of three companies shall be invited in negotiated procedures with a notice of award.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed beforehand.
The selection of undertakings to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example by allowing certain undertakings to be unilaterally preferred.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible collusion of candidates.
In both cases, the contract result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
Contracting entities must therefore take special measures against possible manipulations, carry out adequate controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar rules
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting entities should switch as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
Nor should competition be limited to companies located in certain regions.
The contracting authorities shall justify the selection of candidates and document the course of the competition in their award notes.
Differing regulations
In Germany, at least three suitable candidates must be invited to tender for limited tenders and in the case of freehand tenders, in principle, several suitable candidates must be invited to submit tenders.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is inadmissible to restrict the number of tenderers in the case of non-open procedures and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or a representative from the contracting authority must, as a rule, amend this proposal by removing a proposed undertaking and/or supplementing a new undertaking.
The aim is to prevent a single person from finally determining the circle of undertakings to participate in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow far-reaching arrangements among the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested must be kept confidential, including to freelancers, and should not be made publicly available.
ThisSegmentIsIntentionAllyLeftBlank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding rules for setting up and keeping lists of candidates.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting entity.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.
Significant test results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to request a minimum number of undertakings to tender in the case of non-public procurement was complied with with a few exceptions.
An analysis by the Federal Republic of Germany of nearly 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in the construction sector showed that the contracting authorities requested an average of 6.6 companies for limited tenders in Germany and 4.4 for freehand contracts on average.
Change of business and regional restrictions
Particularly in the case of trades with a few suppliers, the contracting entities did not always change the number of candidates selected.
In particular, they took into account already known and proven companies in their view.
As a reason for this, they stated that in non-public proceedings they had to ensure the suitability of undertakings to compete before the invitation to tender.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional tenderers in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally resident companies than in public tenders.
This was mainly attributed to the fact that, on average, the scope of services for non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower and therefore, for example, longer routes are more important than for public tenders.
Multi-eye principle and proposals Freelance workers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting entities mainly failed to have an independent person amend the proposed list of undertakings requested.
In particular, they justified this on the basis of a lack of processing capacity, deadlines or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who proposed the companies requested to submit a tender.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the list of candidates and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting entities did not protect themselves to the extent required from possible manipulations.
Confidentiality of bidder lists
For a contracting entity, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system which could be viewed by all the staff of that department.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the envisaged or authorised undertakings could have been disclosed unauthorised and, for example, allowed agreements between those undertakings.
documentation
The documentation of the procurement procedures provided only in a few cases justifications for selecting candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of applicants
When building a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not contain information on how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be allowed.
The Procurement Committee then carried out a lot procedure to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle admissible at that time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Because of the high risk of tampering with the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the bidder lists and the exclusive power of the contracting entities to propose the companies to be called upon, the German regulations limit such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public procedures can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings showed that some of these requirements were not sufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants was not sufficiently reduced in these cases.
Contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficits identified.
Offer phase
The tender phase begins with the publication of the award or the invitation to tender, in which companies can draw up tenders on the basis of the procurement documents sent to them.
Candidates may submit their tenders until the expiry of the deadline set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this stage of the procurement procedure.
Contracting entities must comply with the national rules aimed at counteracting the manipulation possibilities available during the tender phase.
These are above all organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar rules
The procurement documents on the basis of which companies are to draw up their tenders must, in principle, be sent only by the contracting entity.
Freelancers involved in the procurement procedure may not perform this task.
The tendering body shall ensure that all applicants receive the same information even during the tender phase.
In the event of ambiguity regarding the procurement documents or other questions relating to the invitation to tender, only the contracting agency may provide information to the candidates.
Freelancers in charge of drawing up the procurement documents may not provide any information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the contracted freelancers and applicants must be prevented.
Freelancers must not become a hub of the procurement procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Tenders submitted by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Tenders submitted electronically shall have technical encryption.
Differing regulations
In Germany, the contracting authority may also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents, whose employees must be obliged to keep the tenders confidential and to comply with the contractual obligations.
Tenders received shall be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and shall be forwarded directly, without delay and unopened to a staff member responsible for custody.
Such staff member shall not be involved in the award.
Tenders received shall be kept closed until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, tenders received shall be marked with a file number.
The issuing company shall record the tender data including order numbers as well as the creation and receipt details in a protocol.
The custody of tenders is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Significant test results
BRH
The tests at the tender phase focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building administration.
Dispatch of procurement documents
The contracting authorities of the audited building administration dispatched the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and dispatched by an external service provider.
Freelancers did not send procurement documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building administration largely did not comply with the requirements for separating planning and awarding when appointing the contact persons for questions and information.
Contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting office, but from the project managers as the contact person.
Some procurement documents even included the names of the freelancers who had drawn up the specifications.
In the event of requests during the tender phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Identification of offers
At the audited building administration, all tenders received were marked with an entry stamp and entry note.
In some freelancers, however, tenders were received by freelancers, which was contrary to the preconditions for preventing corruption.
Store the offers
After their labelling, not all tenders were sent directly and without delay to the official responsible for safekeeping, who included tenders in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, tenders were placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which each staff member had access.
Another department had hung up a mailbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which the offers entered there remained in some cases even overnight.
Since the slot in this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only staff members but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to pick up and, if necessary, manipulate the tenders received.
NKÚ
On the Czech side, no deficiencies were objected.
Summary findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement procedure should be prevented in both countries.
The same information is also intended to respect the principle of equal treatment by all tenderers.
The rules on receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of tenders appear to be suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have shown violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the offers closed up until then will be opened and their contents will be read and made known.
From the date of opening, tenderers shall be bound by their tenders until the expiry of the award period specified by the contractor.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal provisions for opening up tenders.
However, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive provisions for the protection of tenders and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted tenders.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar rules
The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be designated by the receiving office.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from manipulating the offers uncontrollably when opening the offers.
In most procurement procedures, tenderers may participate in the opening date.
Only tenders submitted to the negotiator at the opening of the first tender shall be admitted to the opening.
In principle, tenders received late may not be considered.
In order to ensure transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the tender shall be recorded in a protocol containing, inter alia, the names of the tenderers and the price of the tender.
The minutes shall be read and signed by the negotiating board.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee conducts the opening of tenders.
Freelancers can also participate in this process.
The Committee may also be entrusted with further stages of the procurement procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary are conducting the opening of the tender.
The head of negotiating shall be an official of the issuing body.
The head of negotiation and, in the case of contracts in building construction, the secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents or in the award and execution of contracts.
According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features, such as damaged or late received offers, are to be recorded in the minutes of the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signatures of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing.
Corresponding Czech regulations do not exist.
If only one tender is received during a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is made here, it must be opened and then evaluated.

BRH
Multi-eye principle
The audited contracting entities implemented the requirements for the multieye principle during the opening dates.
They held the opening dates with negotiators and writers who were not in charge of other gaining procedures.
However, in the case of freelancers of lower scope of services, there were occasional cases in which freelancers opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting entity.
transcript
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the tenders submitted late were not registered, and in individual cases even signatures were missing.
Identification of offers
The contracting entities examined during the cross-sectional test marked the tenders by a perforation with the date of the opening date according to the specifications.
Insufficient labelling was found in the case of a number of beneficiaries of some of the beneficiaries.
However, these contracting entities changed their labelling practice following the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Deadline for quotation
When awarding road maintenance measures, a tender was received by the contracting office only one month after the expiry of the tendering period. The tendering company nevertheless accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The arrangements of both countries to open up tenders are consistent in the relevant parts. They take into account both the multieye principle and the transparency principle. This can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation when opening the offers.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as on the marking, the safe safekeeping and the confidentiality of tenders significantly restrict manipulation possibilities such as subsequent modifications to the tenders.
In addition, the agents responsible for opening tenders may not perform any other tasks related to the performance to be awarded.
The only few complaints in total prove the high acceptance of the requirements for opening up the offer.
Examination and evaluation of offers
Examination and evaluation of tenders The client must review and evaluate the tenders present at the opening date.
It shall determine the tender for the award of the award which best meets the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The EU guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
Firstly, the suitability of the tenderers should be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, undertakings which are convicted by law for bribery or fraud should be excluded from participation in the procurement procedure.
The tenders of the non-excluded tenderers shall be constructed, technically and economically assessed and assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client shall determine the most economically advantageous tender. Offers with unusually low prices are to be examined in particular by the client.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly vulnerable phase of the procurement procedure.
For example, bidders can be excluded unjustifiably or tenders that do not meet the requirements can be kept in competition.
Preferring or disadvantaging bidders may inadvertently affect the value result and thus prevent the finding of the most economically advantageous offer.
The contracting authority must therefore take special measures to ensure that the persons responsible for the audit and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar rules
In accordance with the requirements of the EU, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the proof of suitability of undertakings to be submitted and the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the notices or the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.
After the bidding event has been checked, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the tenders.
The evaluation must be limited to the award criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be formally examined immediately to determine whether they are complete and, for example, contain abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they shall be informed thereof without delay.
If the evaluation of the tenders reveals an unreasonably low price, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment before any possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken during the review and evaluation of the offers must be clearly documented.
Differing regulations
In Germany, tenders to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing.
The review of the tenders and the computational verification of the tenders may only be carried out by the prospecting firm.
It shall only employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The exercise of further auditing and evaluation tasks is not further regulated.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the tenders confidentially.
They may only make proposals for decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, contracting committees must be formed to examine and assess tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with proposals for award.
As in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for submission of tenders is submitted incomplete in Germany, the issuing party shall give tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline can the offer be excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the issuing company whether it gives tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must be examined.
Where the price structure of the offer reveals that partial performance prices are too low or too high, the tenderer shall be encouraged to address those ambiguity.
If he fails to do so and the procuring person can provide proof of a mixed costing of the prices, this offer must be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in quantities in partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases in construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is valued, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed costing cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Tenders with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
Where one or more tenders are less than the correct price determination of the contracting entity or the total tenderers' bid amounts by 10% or more, tenderers shall prove that their tenders are correctly calculated.
If they are unable to do so, the issuing authority may exclude the tenders in question.
In the Czech Republic, the invitation to tender may be cancelled after the economic viability assessment if only tenders with unreasonably low prices are available.
Contrary to German public procurement law, the contract cannot be refused for tenders with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority shall immediately report to its specialist supervisory level.
The latter has to decide what measures to be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
For example, the supervisory level must also agree with works of more than 50,000 euros, if a contract is to be awarded freehand, if the tender is not to be awarded on the tender with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no corresponding regulations in the Czech Republic.

Suitability and evaluation criteria
The overwhelming number of procurement procedures examined met the requirements set out above.
In the case of some undertakings proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not verify the suitability of the undertakings themselves.
A beneficiary commissioned undertakings without the required evidence of suitability in full.
In some cases, it was not possible to understand whether the contracting authority took into account all announced award criteria in its selection decision, or whether it only used the criterion “price” in its award decision.
Selection of persons involved and confidentiality of tenders
Some contracting entities used persons not authorised to do so when examining tenders.
For example, freelancers or staff involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks which could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this by insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secrecy and to conscientious fulfillment of contractual obligations were also involved in the freelancers commissioned to examine tenders.
For the construction services it was generally not possible to understand whether the offers from the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly responsible for processing.
Review and computational verification of tenders
Some contracting entities handed over the open tenders to freelancers for further examination without having carried out the prescribed review of tenders and the computational examination themselves and documenting their results.
In the event of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the tenders without this being comprehensible for the contracting entities.
In the documents under review, anomalies or lack of price or product information were partially not marked or insufficiently marked.
Efficiency audits
For a sample in a building administration, the cheapest tenders for three quarters of the procurement procedures examined were more than 10% from the previously determined estimate costs.
Every twentieth procurement procedure was cancelled due to inappropriate tender prices.
Not all bid tests and information discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed information was lacking, such as the unit prices of the main positions.
Often, the deviations were only justified on a flat basis, for example by reference to changes in market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services stated that it was difficult to recognize and prove mixed calculations.
In the event of an invitation to tender by a public law institution, the tender price of the most favourable tender was 66% below the previously determined estimate of these services.
Further calculations or investigations on the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a reconnaissance interview, the contracting entity did not find any evidence of price dumping of the company then commissioned.
As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated estimate was excessive or the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the commissioned company as a “low-cost company” which could not keep quality or deadlines.
In another invitation to tender, a construction service contracted a tender whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
It did not terminate the call for tenders and stated the non-material justification that this company could conclude on a satisfactory calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
In the case of an audited construction administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the technical inspectorate.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two tenderers was identical in the case of an invitation to tender, so that the contractors excluded both tenders from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the examinations did not show any material objections.
NKÚ
qualifying
The contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from the procedure for many of the projects under examination, including higher education, road construction and the extension of the rail network, although they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contractors could not prove or explain why it had excluded a tenderer that had met the requirements.

When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the contracting contractor did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria in the examination and evaluation of tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the contracting body determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road conservation measures, the predetermined criterion “shortening the construction phase” was misjudged in one procedure.
As a result, the reduction offered was not sufficiently taken into account in the second and third tenderers.
Documentation of the selection of quotes
In the case of three procurement procedures under housing promotion, the contracting entity did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it had chosen the successful tenderer.
When building a motorway, the contracting entity selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
In both countries, the rules governing the examination and evaluation of the offers comply with the requirements of the EU.
However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective rules differ from each other.
In Germany, the procedural process is regulated more strongly than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multieye principle and for the protection of tenders.
The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered is to be assessed.
In both countries, some of the procurement procedures examined had to be found that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or insufficiently documented.
However, without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions are favored.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all tenders to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently looked through and documented the tenders in advance, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in further proceedings.
If contracting authorities have tasks performed in the examination and evaluation of tenders by third parties, sufficient precautions and increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the set of tools and did not adequately examine the price structure of the tenders.
In the Czech Republic, complaints were mainly found in the qualification examination and in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the award procedure
After the tenders have been verified and valued, the award procedure shall be concluded by award of the award or by cancelled the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers shall be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
Companies have the option of examining the intended award within 10 days in the case of information by electronic means or by fax or within 15 days for other means of communication and, if necessary, initiating a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
ThisSegmentIsIntentionAllyLeftBlank
If a bidder makes a request for review within the information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court in the context of this review procedure.
The review procedure is intended to ensure legal protection for companies and encourage the contracting entity to comply with the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.
In order to do so, the procedure must be sufficiently documented.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and review procedures.
In both countries, the issuing agency has to decide on the award of the award.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The contracting entity shall award the contract within the announced award period;
also because the tenderers are no longer bound by their tenders after the deadline has expired.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the contracting entity may not deviate from the content of the tender at the time of conclusion of the contract.
The unsuccessful tenderers shall be informed promptly of the decision to award the award and of the reasons for not taking into account their tenders.
Procurement procedures may be cancelled only under certain conditions, for example if the tender prices are excessive or if the tenders do not meet the requirements of the invitation to tender.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, there is a 10-day or 15-day obligation to provide information and wait before the award of the contract, even in the case of construction services not to be awarded across Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide awards.
In the case of other procedures in Germany, tenderers can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure should be repealed if only one tender has been received or only one tender could be considered.
In Germany, the contract shall also be awarded in the case of only one valuable tender, provided that the tender complies with the conditions laid down in the tender and is economic.
Significant test results
BRH
In the case of the procurement procedures examined, there were only a few complaints when the procurement procedures were concluded.
In some cases, companies received letters of contract for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In individual cases, commissioned letters also contained content that deviates from the content of the offer, such as changed dates, in accordance with open procedures.
In several cases, contracting entities did not adhere to the award deadlines.
Therefore, in the case of an open procedure, a contrasting entity awarded the second most advantageous tender, since a company with a 50% more favourable tender was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the expiry of the award period.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting party deviated from the tenderer's offer in terms of content in the contract.
In the case of some contracts, for example in the case of road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting entities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the statutory period.
When awarding works for the refurbishment of former military sites, the contracting party forwarded the notice of the award to all tenderers only after the expiry of the statutory period.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements for the completion of the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of the unsuccessful candidates or tenderers increases the tools for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech procurement law is also extended to awards below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for the award of contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
The construction authorities should avoid the identified shortcomings in the completion of their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The procurement procedures shall be documented in a comprehensible manner during each stage with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for each decision.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded shall be disclosed.
The order data is also recorded in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption Documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency bid.
A carefully and promptly prepared documentation enables the procurement decisions to be traceable.
In particular, it also serves to effectively protect tenderers in relation to contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of the prevention of corruption, as the need to substantiate procurement decisions substantially narrows the scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure shall be sent to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, thereby also implementing the transparency requirement.
The contracting entities shall also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the relevant national ministries of the EU Commission.
On this basis, the EU Commission compiles an annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The regulations on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide procurement, but also covers the other procurement procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, a publication obligation only exists for limited tenders and for freehand contracts with a value limit of EUR 25,000 or EUR 15,000 excluding VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information on the award of contracts.
Significant test results
BRH
documentation
A large number of the procurement procedures examined were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as justifying product specifications or referring to national rules.
In the case of a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to an undertaking, even though its tender did not contain any mandatory evidence to be submitted.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting entities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Announcements of order awards
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting entities failed to announce the award of contracts.
In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting entities had announced the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical statements viewed contained the minimum information required. They had been prepared and sent on time.
Ex post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a construction administration did not publish this data because of a transmission error.
The construction administration noticed this error only after half a year,
so that the contract data of the procurement procedures concluded so far have not been published.
NKÚ
documentation
In the case of construction work for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures showed considerable shortcomings. These were mainly incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the records of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the opening of the offer were not signed.
Announcements of order awards
In several road construction projects, notices concerning contracts awarded were only delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly consistent in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
This ensures the transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, in principle.
The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for the announcement go slightly further than the requirements in Germany.
The identified shortcomings in documentation and notices significantly reduced the orruption-prevention effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
ThisSegmentIsIntentionAllyLeftBlank
Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and fully fulfil their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two main areas which are essential in the procurement of works by public contracting authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Corruption prevention measures are not only aimed at avoiding or at least reducing corruption. They should also avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two Court of Auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries and the comparison of these rules reveal similarities and differences which may be helpful for both countries in the further development of their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's requirements for the award of works into national law.
This provides an important common basis in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works and for taking into account the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the undertakings involved and transparency of procurement procedures.
The construction administrations of both countries have partly compensated these bids very extensively by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has broadly also transferred the requirements for the works to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally adjustable procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the examinations carried out by the auditors have shown that the construction authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the reported complaints when implementing the EU guidelines.
Examinations in the Czech Republic have highlighted above all dangers that affect the profitability of the awards.
For example, incomplete specifications required additional benefits, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, cost investigations were usually insufficient. Exaggerated qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport structures.
Corruption prevention
The investigations did not aim to detect cases of corruption
also because the Court of Auditors do not have the appropriate tools for this purpose.
However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken measures against corruption and manipulation in the procurement of works and how these requirements are applied.
In the prevention of corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
The German regulations foresee largely unlimited competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations aim above all to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of the prevention of corruption apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of works and are aligned with their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant rules define the way in which the bids to prevent corruption must be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In particular, the BRH considers that the priority of the open procedure or the public tender principle is an appropriate instrument to substantially reduce the risk of corruption in the procurement of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative intervention.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
Therefore, the Federal Republic of Germany does not see a fundamental need to change the relevant requirements of the administrations in the procurement of works.
The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in sub-areas have shown shortcomings in the implementation of some guidelines.
The construction authorities should further train their employees on the rules on corruption prevention and raise them even more awareness of this issue.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the construction authorities to freelancers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of misuse increases when delegating tasks.
Tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interference.
NKÚ
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which public procurement is the most important component.
The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The NKÚ audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures as contracting entities assess the profitability of contracts, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of qualification requirements, the key evaluation criteria and the nature of assessments and must properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU guidelines in principle positively.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU bids of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and immaterial potential of damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the procurement of works, both auditors see the demand for the construction authorities in their countries to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continually examined for vulnerabilities and risks in order to identify the need for action and take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures provide a wider area for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of works into lots can also have a favourable effect on offer prices provided that it achieves greater competition with a higher number of tenderers.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for an efficient procurement activity of contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialized construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks — with the exception of transport projects — are carried out by the departments themselves or contractors commissioned by them.
The Court of Auditors of both countries is anxious to develop the relevant findings and, if necessary, bring them to the parliament and government of their country, even after their joint project has been completed.
Both Court of Auditors also believe that the principles of public procurement law and its implementation set out in this report are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure the economic allocation of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.
