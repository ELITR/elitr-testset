Public procurement of works and corruption prevention
Joint Report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on its parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance to both the State and the economy.
The task of the State is to use public funds as economically and sparingly as possible, as well as to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure a largely unlimited level of competition, contracting authorities must comply with EU standards in their allowances starting from certain values (thresholds).
To this end, EU Member States must transfer and apply EU procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below EU thresholds, individual countries are left to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also a corruption-prone area.
In view of the fundamentally high potential for damage, contracting authorities are therefore required to implement appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favours in the award of their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits on both the EU-wide award of works and the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of the EU procurement law transposed into national rules and on the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in construction and road construction and/or transport infrastructure.
The allowances below EU thresholds were also included in the viewings with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both accounting offices are summarised in the present Joint Report.
The report is also intended to address international bodies, such as: For example, contact the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) −.
Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional audits carried out in 2011/2012 in the construction administrations responsible for the road and construction of the federal government in Germany.
In doing so, he examined, for example. For example, the construction of highways as well as major superstructure projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic laid the foundation for its evaluations of audit findings from 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction activities in road construction, rail construction, water construction, high construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.), and other areas of construction in the Czech Republic.
The award of public contracts by the federal government in Germany mostly carries out the construction administrations of the Federal States.
In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for transport infrastructure grants.
In superstructure, the concessions are carried out decentralized by those bodies that use government budget appropriations.
In both countries, freelance activities are also activated for sub-areas of the procurement procedures.
The comparison of evaluations should take into account differences in the procurement law and the market structure for the construction services of both countries.
Development of procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sphere shall be governed by budgetary law and by the administrative provisions establishing it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national concessions, many supplementary individual schemes are laid down by internal administrative provisions:
Such as the so-called "Federal Procurement Manuals," in which the statutory requirements are supplemented or elaborated in more detail, in accordance with the procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is exclusively governed by the Procurement Act and by the other legal provisions applicable both to the area above and below EU thresholds.
The procurement law was significantly revised in 2012.
The new regulation strengthened transparency in the handling of public funds, allowed greater competition and limited the possibility of corruption in the procurement process.
Guidelines of procurement law in both countries
In both countries, EU-wide concessions shall in particular be subject to the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold shall be subject to the application of the national procurement rules (public tender, restricted invitation to tender, open-ended award), which, however, are largely in line with the above-mentioned EU-wide procurement.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterized by the principle of the priority of the open procedure (in the case of EU-wide donations) and the public tender (in the case of national gifts).
Any interested party may submit an offer in the open procedure and in the public invitation to tender.
Another major feature of German procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
This is mainly for the purpose of dividing an overall construction measure into technical and partial lots.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above features of German procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
In Germany, over 330,000 construction companies have a workforce of 1.9 million.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures must also be applied to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception here is the simplified procedure in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech procurement law contains, in accordance with EU law, provisions requiring contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is obtained.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open and non-open procedures.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 and more employees.
Volume of construction of contracting authorities and shares of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in the year was EUR 2011,307 billion.
Of these, EUR 45.5 billion was made up of public works (15%), which includes, in addition to federal construction, in particular, the construction measures of the municipalities.
The federal construction volume in high construction and long-distance road construction (excluding rail construction and water construction) included 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the civil engineering and long-distance construction of the Federal Government was distributed among the Contracting Authorities in 2011 as follows: 80.7% Open Procedures and Public Procurement, 12.7% Non-Open Procedures and Limited Alerts and 6.6% Negotiated Procedures and Free-Handed Gifts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide gifts.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 4.7 billion in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was 7.8 billion euros, representing 37% of the total building volume.
Breakdown by contract number for 2011: 65.1% open procedure 14.3% non-public procedure 9.5% negotiated procedure 8.4% simplified procedures for order volume below threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded in 2011 by public procurement agencies.
The o.a. Data indicate that the parallel audits of both countries are based on a significant proportion of public donations, which have a major financial impact on all allowances and have a significant role to play in the award of contracts in the open procedure and public procurement.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits in their countries on EU-wide award of works and corruption prevention.
In this context, the working groups of both audit firms compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.
In doing so, they essentially noted:
The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (No. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to EU rules, corruption prevention also serves the procurement systems of both countries, which differ in part in their priorities and in detail (No 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the procurement documents is that they contain all the information necessary for proper submission of tenders.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not have any betting restrictions.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject matter of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services must be broken down as far as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this provision was largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, in particular in the field of road construction, the NKÚ found that the award of extensive benefits without lots or with very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Market potential increases can lead to significant increases in costs and are at risk of price or other agreements.
Under the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, in principle agree with the undertakings already contracted on additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No 4.1).
The respective requirements for setting the type of award have been followed mostly in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting agencies may choose freely between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary precedence of the open procedure in the case of EU-wide concessions or the Public Invitation to Tender, which corresponds to the open procedure in the case of national gifts, applies.
This allows more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders, and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated overall contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the verified construction administrations basically awarded construction services throughout Europe.
The proper estimation of the estimated order value is an essential basis in choosing the correct type of contract.
In Germany, cost data banks are used for the cost investigation of public buildings, in particular in the construction of cost databases:
The construction projects completed on the evaluations.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No 4.2).
In the case of works to be awarded across Europe, prior information and notices shall be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adapt to the planned concessions early on.
The surveyed construction administrations usually adhered to this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or missing controls may impede competition (No 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly subject to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate against and must be announced in advance.
In addition to the EU's requirements, contracting bodies in both countries are to switch among the companies to be requested as frequently as possible when selecting candidates.
In Germany, there are some very detailed requirements to address the risk of tampering.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take account of these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, candidate selection decisions were not always questionable (No 4.4).
In both countries, in order to ensure fair competition during the tender phase, it is necessary to ensure that the undertakings interested in the submission of tenders receive the same information.
In order to avoid anti-competitive agreements between these undertakings and those involved in the preparation of the Terms of Service, it is necessary to prevent contact between them and those involved in the preparation of the Terms of Service.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, the surveyed construction administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements in part (No. 4.5).
When opening tenders, the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency must be observed in both countries.
The requirements for the labelling, documentation, preservation and secrecy of the offers are intended to confine tampering spaces and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The tests in both countries showed few complaints (No 4.6).
In both countries, the examination and evaluation of the tenders are defined by guidelines for the organisation of the structure and expiration.
The rules in Germany are more comprehensive but have not been observed by the notified contracting authorities.
For example, contracting entities handed over tenders to third parties for examination without having to see through the offers before and document noticeably.
The offers were thus not adequately protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the undertakings involved in the competition will be informed of the intended award prior to award.
This option also has a preventive function against corruption.
The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities not comply with the time limits laid down in the contract releases, or do not examine the tenderers' offer in content (point 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible with the audit of the construction authorities in both countries.
The EU-wide transparency bid was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notes of some procedures.
Also, some of the deficiencies found diminished the corruption-prone function of the documentary.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No 4.9).
Principles of EU procurement law and corruption prevention
EU-assignment right
In order to ensure unlimited competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Appeal Directive, which were to be transposed into national law by the Member States 8.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, that of the Competition Bid, the Equal Treatment Bid or the Prohibition of Discrimination and the Transparency Bid.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive contains specific rules for construction services for construction projects to be awarded throughout the EU.
For this purpose, their estimated order totals must reach or exceed EUR 5.000.000 at present.
The rules concern in particular the content of the procurement documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia, for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements for the qualification of candidates and the appeal directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringement of the procurement law, the undertakings concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in verification proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union's directives into national law.
Corruption prevention
Importance of corruption prevention
In both countries, there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption means the abuse of a position of confidence for the private advantage,
The I.D. By the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of the world economic performance.
For the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
For contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question trust in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.
In doing so, they must review the organisation and organisation of their administrations in areas of particularly corruption-prone nature in order to implement appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly limit the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works services is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - particularly bribery and brilliance, and benefit acceptance and approval − is prosecuted and labour law prosecuted.
To prevent corruption, the federal government issued a directive and recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed for the award area: Priority of Public Procurement and Open Procedures, More Eyes Principle and Transparency, Fundamental Separation of Planning, Award and Settlement, Accuracy and Full Documentation of Procurement Procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption requirements are included in the procurement rules.
For example, in 2011, the German Federal Ministry of Public Procurement for Federal Highway Concessions introduced an electronically based control system,
With the procurement data − such as: For example, the estimated costs and the order totals are collected in a wide range of ways, as well as information on the persons working in a freelance profession involved and evaluated for striking reasons.
Corruption is also subject to criminal and labour law in the Czech Republic.
The legal requirements for transparency and equal treatment of tenderers and the prohibition of any discrimination constitute the main foundations of the prevention of corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech Government adopted anti-corruption measures in a anti-corruption strategy paper for 2011 to 2012 and updated them for 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national procurement law and related administrative provisions.
The new legislation essentially includes the following rules: Reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, requirement for prior notice of concessions by the awarding authority, including listing of the reasons for tender, prohibition of restricting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus eliminating the possibility of bidder selection through loose procedures, introduction of the obligation to publish the procurement documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and introduction of the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the individual stages of the procurement procedure
Assignment documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents shall contain all information required by tenderers for proper submission of tenders.
In particular, procurement documents must enable sufficient calculation.
In doing so, the tenderers must not be transferred to risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The procurement documents shall consist in particular of the description of performance and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements to demonstrate the qualifications (suitability) of tenderers, as well as the criteria relevant for the selection of the most economical tender.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are in particular addressed to technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all tenderers and should limit competition as little as possible.
The performance description must in principle be product neutral.
Therefore, information relating to products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under close conditions.
Avoiding restrictions on competition in the procurement documents is also an essential principle of prevention of corruption.
Furthermore, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents must be avoided as they open up margins for speculation in the preparation of tenders and for manipulation in their evaluation.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar regulations In both countries, EU regulations on technical specifications are transposed into national law.
The services must in principle be described as product neutral without factory specifications.
In the performance descriptions, the individual services must normally be broken down into units of performance with individual quantities.
The prices shall be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g.: For example Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may services be defined by functional targets.
The performance descriptions must in any case be complete and unique.
They shall contain accurate quantities and shall not include services that do not determine whether they are needed.
Fees by flat rate or by time shall be avoided as far as possible.
The purpose of these provisions is to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the procurement documents.
The performance descriptions must allow tenderers to make their offers safely and without extensive preliminary work.
The invitation to tender shall not be announced until the tender documents have been completed.
Divergent arrangements
There is no obligation to tender for works in Losen in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be provided, the public procurement agencies may divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are in principle divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and/or by type or field of expertise (skilled).
This is intended to enable medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is considered to be the most economic in general.
Value criteria must be set out in the procurement documents in the Czech Republic for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This is intended to ensure that candidates are fully and finalised aware of the criteria under which their offers should be accepted.
In Germany, the indication of value criteria in EU-wide notices, but not later than in the procurement documents, is required only for EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the value criteria must only be recorded in an in-house procurement focus.
In Germany, procurement documents drawn up by seconded professional workers may not contain any reference to these offices or participating planners or choirs in the construction and some road construction administrations.
This is intended to prevent individual companies from being able to obtain additional information or other undue competitive advantages via contact with these professional operators without the client's knowledge.
This is also the reason why professional activities cannot send procurement documents or issue planning documents for insight.
The Customer alone is the contact person of the companies.
There is currently no provision for this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services which prove necessary after the initial contract has been concluded (nocturns) almost always apply to large construction projects.
In both countries, legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of contracts to the undertaking already appointed without the need to carry out a public procurement procedure.
According to EU and German rules, the remuneration of supplementary services must not exceed half of the main contract.
Furthermore, the additional services must not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a lower limit of 20% shall apply to the award without a public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of a delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the existing construction work.
If additional services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is not possible under the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basics of the price determination of the order already awarded must be assumed.
In addition to additional services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of performance.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be charged with additional supplementary services.
Essential audit results
BHR
Technical specifications and product neutral tender
In individual cases, the performance descriptions included references to national technical approvals or standards which had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications - such as for anti-proliferation protection, ran bands, or noise protection plates - without the need to do so.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so closely that only one product was eligible.
List of services broken down by sub-service
The BRH has not found any breaches of the requirement in any of the procedures under consideration to write out benefits in principle in a list of services broken down by sub-service.
Completeness of the Terms of Service
In the vast number of procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the invitations to tender.
For some procedures, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase as some positions or deadlines had changed.
Meanwhile, the performance directories contained positions where they were not determined whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted almost half of such requirements.
Lots and value criteria
In the case of many gifts, there was a lack of the prescribed justification for the reasons why the services, mostly distributed according to the skilled person, were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no complaints in specifying the criteria to be laid down in the evaluation of tenders.
References to professional activities
A small part of the Terms of Service included references to the freelance persons involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or opinions.
In one case, the Contracting Authority even specifically asked candidates to contact the architect "on questions relating to the tender."
In particular, in the area of superstructure, the awarding agencies attributed the complaints shown mostly to the failures of those working for the purposes of drawing up the descriptions of benefits.
Construction services pointed to the lack of capacity in order to be able to sufficiently control the performance descriptions.
NK Ú
Technical specifications and product neutral invitation to tender In the case of public procurement for the construction of a residence with 12 housing units, a supplier and a specific product mark were specified in the description of performance.
The Contracting Authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying them.
When several higher education buildings were established, the invitation to tender also specified suppliers and products.
Performance Descriptions with Performance Units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the Contracting Authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the terms of service.
As a performance unit, it merely stated the rebuilt space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of the Terms of Service
When a motorway bypass was built, the performance descriptions were amended four times as part of an undisclosed procedure during the period August to September 2009,
As the power sizes had greatly increased and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings included inaccurate location information, inadequate engineering preliminary investigations, and incomplete design drawings, requiring additional services to be commissioned.
When building a large library building, the interior performance description contained no product quality requirements.
As a result of these missing specifications, some sub-companies built overpriced and unduly high-quality equipment.
Lots and suitability criteria
In the Czech Republic, the allocation of construction measures into partial contracts or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded in bulk, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible at a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, in the case of six different buildings which were the subject of a single contract alone, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved in the event of a loose award.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be awarded in bulk, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to an overall award.
In the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority provided very extensive reference requirements as an eligibility criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the Contracting Authority requested the tenderers in an open procedure, inter alia, to demonstrate at least three road projects carried out, worth 28 million euros each from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public award of another part of a motorway included six separate construction projects in which the Contracting Authority had established an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million in the last three years as an eligibility criterion for the undertakings.
Two-thirds of the appropriations raised in 2008 and 2009 for road construction projects (i.e. 2.5 billion euros totalling 3.7 billion euros) accounted for contracts from a total of five companies carrying out the contracts alone or as road users.
For 46 award procedures with an order size of EUR 528 million, only two or only one tenderer made an offer.
The NKÚ showed that narrowing market potential can lead to significant increases in costs.
Additional services
In the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures in two cases in the award of additional services and did not enter into any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, night amounts were generated in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), increasing the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several higher education buildings, some benefits were not included in the procurement documents, although their need for the award was already known.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority and the contracted undertakings conducted negotiated procedures without notice of award.
In the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority retained the right to award additional works in negotiated proceedings without a tender.
During the construction period, the Contracting Authority expanded the scope of the work by EUR 2 million.
Unit prices for the additional construction services granted without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further findings
Due to a sample review of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway helicopter in the Czech Republic was up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway helicopter is up to €10.4 million, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction.
This comparison suggests that highway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly in line with both countries and take into account the amounts of the EU.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and corruption prevention.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the performance descriptions should allow tenderers to properly calculate and create their offers:
Protect the customer from subsequent additional services and also curb speculative spaces.
The common basic requirements for the procurement documents are supplemented in Germany by regulations aimed at further reducing competition restrictions and manipulating possibilities.
There are no requirements to this extent in the Czech Republic, and for this purpose transparency is increased by publishing the value criteria in non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for the description of benefits have been largely met in both countries.
In some cases, however, there had to be discrepancies which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The German bid to form Losen promotes competition and results in economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the NKÚ 's audit findings, the award of extensive benefits without lots or with very large lots of restrictions on the provider field may result in only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements laid down in the Czech Republic in road construction have resulted in public contracts being awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and smaller and medium-sized enterprises not being allowed to participate in the competition.
A limited number of competitors also often lead to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
In the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
In accordance with EU and German rules, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract may be awarded with public notice under certain conditions without procurement procedures.
In the Czech Republic, a closer limit of 20% applies, up to which additional services under the negotiated procedure can be awarded to the original contractor without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
Since the scope of performance in public procurement is often not determined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be notified with public notice.
By dividing benefits into lots, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Setting the type of procurement and taking into account the EU threshold
By setting the type of award, the contracting entity shall determine the amount of the number of undertakings participating in the competition.
It may leave the circle of possible candidates and tenderers largely unbounded, such as by choosing an open procedure, or may limit them by setting out non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, pan-European procurement procedures shall be applied.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In choosing the type of contract, the contracting authority shall take into account, in particular, the Council of Europe bids for competition and transparency.
If the total estimated contract value of the works of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5.000.000 euro, the works shall, in principle, be awarded across Europe in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may, in the case of construction projects which reach or exceed the EU threshold, differ to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European award and award works services in national procurement, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1.000.000 euro and that the sum of these lots does not exceed 20 % of the estimated total contract value of all works contracts.
A single construction project may not be divided into individual measures without a compelling reason or deliberately estimated with too low cost values in order to eliminate it from the obligation to award works in principle across Europe.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of tampering, the choice of the type of procurement is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification for the type of award chosen and the examination of the application of EU procurement schemes are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and threshold into national law.
Divergent arrangements
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental uniformity of open and non-open procedures contained in the Directive to its construction obligations which are not subject to the EEA.
There is freedom of choice between the open procedure and the non-open procedure without the need to prescribe or justify the decision. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national gifts - the Public Tender is in principle a priority. This is determined by the law on budgets and contracts and by the pre-corruption directives.
Other contracting parties - as well as the non-open procedure or the Limited Invitation to Tender − are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by the procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be justified and documented.
The principle of priority of the open procedure or public tender is intended to ensure as unlimited competition as possible, to exclude manipulation possibilities by setting certain tenderers and to make possible price agreements among tenderers more difficult.
The principle of public tender is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.
The proper estimation of the estimated order value is an essential basis in choosing the correct type of contract.
Construction services in Germany may use the planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organisations when determining the estimated costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases include cost characteristics for building categories, usage units, components or individual building services.
On the basis of such cost characteristics, the estimated order value of a planned foreclosure or construction performance can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few construction administrations in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot use central databases or average price investigations of comparable construction measures when determining the estimated cost of construction services.
In most cases, the cost estimates are based on estimates from the financing body or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardize cost-identification procedures are still in the beginnings.
The relevant ministries were commissioned under the Anti-Corruption Plan for 2011-2012 to establish a database for standardized building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In this data bank information should be grasped to the cost of materials and to construction crafts and removal crafts as well as other data relevant for costs to allow cost inquiries and regulations of uniform prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects for better cost control.
Which is to be used as a comparative measure for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.

The notified contracting authorities largely wrote out the works by open procedure or public invitation to tender, following the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services were publicly announced in the superstructure and in the open process respectively.
In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.
In the selection of non-public tenderers, partial detailed reasons were missing as to why the awarding agencies had to derogate from the principle of open procedure or public tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures that non-public contracting parties have significant disadvantages in competition over open procedures and public procurement and increase the risk of tampering and corruption.
In the superstructure, more than twice as many tenders were submitted in public procurement as in restricted tenders and almost three times as many offers as in the case of free-handed gifts.
The investigation also showed that the price of tenders for restricted tenders and free-handed loans was on average 6% and 10% higher, respectively, than for public procurement.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a State Court of Auditors confirmed the differences in profitability between public and non-public procurement firms.
The Federal Ministry of Construction, as a result of its research into economic efficiency, even came up with twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of construction projects for which they had established an estimated total order amount of more than EUR 5.000.000, the notified contracting authorities normally established procurement plans in which they established the works to be awarded in accordance with the EU and the works to be awarded in accordance with national procurement procedures.
Under the procurement plans a share of more than 80% of the construction services was to be awarded across the EU.
Bypassing the commitment to EU-wide concessions through too low estimates of costs was not possible.
However, some of the incorrect calculations led to the fact that the EU minimum share was undercut further.
During the construction process, some awarding bodies have not been able to alter the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be followed.
For most of the construction measures under examination, the share of EU-wide payments was mostly lower than planned under the procurement plan, according to the billing results.
In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the awarding agencies were in breach of the requirement to write out all 1.000.000 euros and more comprehensive invertebrates in EU-wide procedures:
And elected national procedures instead.
NK Ú
Selection of type of award
In several major construction activities, such as the construction of some sections of highway, construction projects under a major sporting event, as well as housing projects, the contracting entities divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services were equivalent or comparable.
Through these divisions, the individual services were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Estimated order value calculation methods
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were an insufficient tool to determine the estimated order values.
The data was based on just-completed construction projects, but there was evidence of lack of efficiency, unnecessary additional performance or excessive profits from the contracted firms.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined using the database.
The Ministry of Transport also revised the databases in order to take account not only of the prices offered in recent years but also of comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In the construction, the estimated order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on investor estimates.
Actual order values weighed heavily from estimated values.
The estimate price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice the value of the order agreed upon later, but eight nights in the course of construction resulted in a cost increase of EUR 2.1 million and 27% respectively.
Similarly, the actual order value in the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimate price, with cost increases in the construction phase also occurring here.
In other cases, offer prices exceeded estimated values and increased even during construction.
When a large library was built, the estimate price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. When building a judicial building, costs increased disproportionately at 139%, as the useful area had only expanded by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU rules for defining the type of procurement and taking into account the EU threshold. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line with each other.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public invitation to tender applicable in Germany goes beyond EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies may participate in competition in public procedures or public procurement.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economical results.
The threat of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the candidate field by tampering with the client and making price arrangements between bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, contracting agencies may award contracts under open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes in the procurement law, the number of tenderers may no longer be limited in the case of procedures with previous participation competition.
Thus, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting agencies have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the Public Invitation to Tender. In the Czech Republic, some services were allocated inadmissible in order to circumvent the requirements for choosing the type of award.
When taking account of the EU threshold, errors had to be identified in Germany which led to a reduction in the minimum share of EU-wide services.
There is still no satisfactory solution in the Czech Republic to properly identify the estimated cost of construction services and construction projects.
Construction administrations should, where appropriate, ensure by means of further controls that the requirements for the selection of the type of contract and the scope of performance to be written out across the EU are complied with or that the conditions for sufficient cost determination are created.
Pre-information and notice
In the case of construction projects with works to be awarded across Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned concessions in advance of the invitation to tender.
Prior information and notices form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information is intended to contain the essential procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required in the case of construction projects where the total estimated contract value exceeds or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting entity wishes to reduce the period of submission of open or non-open procedures.
In notices, the contracting authority must provide detailed details of the construction contracts to be awarded across Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of performance, the dates of procedure and execution, the particular requirements, the value criteria and their weighting.
The common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes) must be used to describe the object of the order.
Preliminary information and notices shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the contracting authority's buyer profile.
In order to prevent the detriment of foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain additional information and shall be issued only after the publication of the notice text to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and may even support tampering.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar arrangements
EU legislation on pre-information and notice has fully transposed both countries into national law.
Divergent arrangements
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published for non-European works.
Procurement procedures may be started not later than one month after prior information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (in the case of EU-wide donations) or to the national Official Journal (in the case of all concessions).
Only in exceptional cases can a prior information publication be waived.
In Germany, no prior information is necessary in the non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tender and participation competitions shall be published on the Internet portal of the Federal Government and, where appropriate, in newspapers or magazines before restricted tenders.
In the case of restricted tenders without competition for participation, notices of services to be awarded are required from 25,000 euros (ex ante transparency).
All planned lots of construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of loose construction donations.
In the Czech Republic, this scheme affects only a small extent, as much less works are divided into lots there.
Essential audit results
BRH
Advance informations
The notified contracting authorities published preliminary information on all projects under examination with construction services to be awarded across Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they reduced the time-limits for tenders, although the time-limit of 52 days required between the dispatches of the prior information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other abridged procedures were only announced after the 12-month period of prior information had already expired and before it had been extended.
For many published preliminary information, evidence of the planned breakdown of works into lots was missing.
Announcements
The notices of the notified bodies included partial CPV codes, which were contrary to the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not cover the services required.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information - e.g. For example, the period of implementation - as the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service undertaking to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the messages on his own fee-based procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not verify whether the company had forwarded the notifications to the free Internet portal of the federal government as required.
Samples showed that only one third of the reports from the verified administration were published on this portal.
NK Ú
Announcements
When constructing a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it intended to select tenderers.
The awarding authority was unable to demonstrate how bidders were selected.
The limitation of the number of tenderers was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the construction of a motorway ring, the awarding authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure that it intended to assess the qualification of candidates and how many candidates would allow them to compete.
In its evaluation, the awarding authority concluded that all six candidates complied with the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate from the further procedure with the worst ratings.
The contracting authority's approach was not transparent because it had not disclosed any information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time in the procedure.
Publication of notices
When the former military site was renovated, the Contracting Authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage education system, with pre-information and notice, is an important element in implementing the transparency bid in Europe-wide concessions, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU guidelines and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
Unlike public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures cannot involve any undertaking interested in performing the services to be awarded.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority shall make a selection in advance of which undertakings are to be invited to submit tenders.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow a limit on the number of candidates in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five undertakings shall be requested to submit tenders.
In the case of negotiated procedures with notice of award, at least three undertakings shall be invited.
In any case, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly vulnerable to tampering, such as: For example, by allowing certain companies to be unilaterally preferred.
In addition, limiting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.
In both cases, the result at the customer's expense can be significantly affected.
The contracting authorities must therefore make specific arrangements against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and compatibility of this process step.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar arrangements
The rules governing the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EEA commitments, the contracting authorities are to switch among the companies to be requested as frequently as possible when selecting the candidates.
Nor should competition be limited to undertakings established in certain regions.
The contracting authorities shall give reasons for the selection of candidates and shall document the course of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Divergent arrangements
In Germany, in the case of restricted tenders, at least three and, in principle, in the case of free-handed, several suitable candidates must be requested for submission of tenders.
Under the new Czech rules, − of two special areas, apart from −, it is inadmissible to restrict the number of tenderers in non-open procedures and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the more-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, has For example, if an employee proposes a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the Construction Service or a Contracting Representative from the Contracting Authority must usually amend this proposal by removing or supplementing, for example, a third-party entity and/or a new entity.
This is intended to prevent a single person from finally determining the circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, this could allow far-reaching collusion among those involved in the event of manipulative intentions.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated in a confidential manner, including those working in a professional capacity, and not made available to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no appropriate rules for the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.
In accordance with the German rules, professional activities are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.
Essential audit results
BRH
Number of candidates
The requirement to request a minimum number of undertakings to submit tenders for non-public donations has been complied with except for a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the R & D of nearly 7,000 non-European-wide procurement procedures of construction services in the superstructure showed that, in the case of restricted federal tenders in Germany, the contracting agencies requested an average of 6.6 and, in the case of free-to-air contracts, an average of 4.4 companies for the submission of tenders.
Change of enterprises and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of plants with a few providers, the contracting entities did not always change the circle of selected candidates.
They took account, in particular, of companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.
As a reason for this, they indicated that, in the event of non-public procedures, they had to ensure the suitability of the undertakings to be called upon to compete before calling for a tender.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction on regional tenderers in the non-public procurement procedures, but probably a higher proportion of regional companies than in public procurement.
The contracting authorities attributed this above all to the fact that, on average, the level of performance of non-public procurement procedures is much smaller and therefore, for example: For example, longer access routes are more important than public procurement.
More Eyes Principle and Proposals Professional
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to allow the proposed list of requesting companies to be amended by an independent person.
They justified this, in particular, with lack of processing capacity, timing pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative appropriate companies.
Also, it was often not documented who had proposed the companies requested for the submission of tenders.
Some samples showed that professional activities had drawn up the candidate lists and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
Thus, the contracting agencies did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidding lists
At an awarding agency, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the envisaged or approved undertakings would have been passed on in an unauthorised manner, including: For example, to enable collusion among these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases reasons for selecting the candidates.
NK Ú
Selection of candidates
When building a motorway ring, bidders did not receive information about the assessment criteria and evaluation procedures.
In the non-open procedures for the expansion and modernisation of waterways and ports, notices did not contain details of how candidates should be selected.
In a procedure, all eight of the participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be granted.
The Procurement Committee then carried out a batch procedure to select the companies.
However, this principle of principle at that time should have been cited as one of the criteria set out in the notice.
Summary findings
Because of the high risk of tampering with the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have made specific arrangements to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the more eye-catching principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting entities to propose the requesting companies, the German requirements restrict such abuse possibilities.
The Czech rules may, in particular, counteract the newly introduced provision of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public procedures of possible manipulative restrictions.
However, test findings have shown that some of these requirements have been sufficiently implemented and that the potential for tampering with the field of participation has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
Contracting authorities should eliminate the identified deficits in full.
Offer phase
Notice of award or invitation to tender shall begin the tendering phase during which undertakings may draw up tenders on the basis of the procurement documents sent to them.
Applicants may submit their tenders until the expiry of the time limit laid down by the Contracting Authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU rules for this stage in the procurement procedure.
Contracting bodies shall comply with national rules designed to counter the manipulation possibilities available during the tender phase.
These are mainly organizational requirements and controls.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar arrangements
The procurement documents on the basis of which the undertakings are to draw up their tenders must, in principle, only be sent by the contracting authority.
Professional activities involved in the award procedure may not perform this task.
The contracting authority shall ensure that all candidates receive the same information during the tender phase.
In the event of any ambiguity with the procurement documents or other questions relating to the invitation to tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the candidates.
Professional activities responsible for the preparation of the procurement documents shall not provide any information.
During the entire stage of the offer, contact between the seconded professionals and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelance workers may not become a hub of the procurement procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
By post or directly submitted tenders shall be submitted in a closed envelope.
Tenders submitted electronically shall be subject to technical encryption.
Divergent arrangements
In Germany, the Contracting Authority may, with the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents, also order external service companies whose employees must be obliged to keep the tenders secret and to carry out the contractual matters in a conscientious manner.
The tenders received shall be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and sent directly, immediately and unopened to a member of the staff responsible for the storage.
This staff member shall not be involved in the award.
Tenders received shall be kept under wraps by the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a reference number.
The awarding authority shall keep the tender data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt data, in a record.
The storage of tenders is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Essential audit results
BRH
The selection phase tests focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a superstructure administration.
Dispatch of procurement documents
The contracting authorities of the superstructure administration audited the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and shipped by an external service company.
Freelance activities did not send procurement documents.
Information to applicants
The verified superstructure management mostly did not comply with the requirements for separation of planning and awarding in the designation of contacts for queries and information.
In the performance descriptions, it stated that, contrary to the requirements, it was not an employee from the awarding agency, but rather from the project lines as a contact person.
Some procurement documents even included the names of freelance workers who had drawn up the terms of service.
In case of enquiries during the tender phase, not all candidates received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of tenders
During the inspection of the superstructure management, all tenders received were marked with input stamps and input references.
In some free-handed gifts, however, the offers were received by freelance workers, which contradicted the pretensions for the prevention of corruption.
Retention of tenders
After their labelling, not all tenders were made directly and without delay to the officer responsible for the storage, who included the tenders in a steel closet.
In a construction department, the tenders were in an open compartment of the post office to which each staff member was involved.
Another department had hung a letterbox in a non-continuously monitored hallway, in which the offers raised there remained in some cases even overnight.
Since the disposable slot of this letter box was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the department would have had the opportunity to pick up and manipulate offers received.
NK Ú
There were no defects on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the tender phase, in particular, contacts between interested companies and those involved in the award procedure should be prevented in both countries.
In addition, by providing all tenderers with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should be respected.
The rules for receiving, preserving and keeping offers appear suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed breaches of the rules in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of tenders
Opening of tenders
During the opening date, the offers closed by then will be opened and their contents read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, tenderers shall be bound by their tenders until the expiry of the award period laid down by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
No separate EU legislation is laid down for opening tenders.
However, for this high-level phase of the procurement procedure, national rules on the prevention of corruption contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition.
The more-eyes principle as well as the transparency and visibility of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulation and change in the submitted offers.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar arrangements
The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be determined by the contracting authority.
The more-eyes principle is intended to prevent individuals from making uncontrolled manipulation to the offers when the offers are opened.
In most procurement procedures, bidders may participate in the opening date.
Only tenders submitted to the negotiator at the opening of the first tender shall be accepted for opening.
Late tenders must no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the acts carried out and the results of the opening of tenders shall be set out in a protocol setting out, inter alia, the names of the tenderers and the price of tenders.
The Protocol must be read and signed by the Negotiating Board.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Divergent arrangements
In the Czech Republic, a committee shall open tenders.
Self-employed persons can also participate in this process.
The Committee may also be charged with further stages of the procurement procedure, such as: For example, with the evaluation of the offers.
In Germany, a negotiator and a scriptwriter conduct the opening of tenders.
The negotiator shall be a member of the contracting authority.
The negotiator and, in the case of grants in the construction of the building, the scriptwriter should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents as well as in the award and processing of the contract.
In accordance with the German rules, the minutes of the opening date shall include, in addition to the offer prices, information on skonti and discounts, as well as specifics − such as damaged or late tenders.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the tender and the signature authority are recorded.
The German rules provide that the open tenders must be marked in all parts in such a way as to prevent subsequent changes and additions.
The offers are usually offered. Marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They shall be kept secret after the opening date and shall be made available only to persons directly responsible for processing.
Corresponding Czech regulations do not exist.
If only one tender is received in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such scheme in Germany. If only one offer is received, it must be opened and then valued.

BRH
More ocular principle
The notified contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They conducted the opening dates each with negotiators and writers tasked with no other procurement treatments.
However, in the case of freemasons giving less performance, there were sometimes cases in which freemasons opened up offers sent to them without the participation of the awarding agency.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
Some of them included: For example, the late tenders submitted were not registered, and in individual cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of tenders
The contracting entities examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination identified the tenders by means of a perforation with the date of the opening date.
Insufficient labelling had been identified in the case of long tests carried out by some beneficiaries.
However, these contracting bodies changed their labelling practice after complaint by the BRH.
NK Ú
Offer term
In the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders. The Contracting Authority nevertheless accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The arrangements of both countries for opening tenders are consistent in relevant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, corruption and tampering risks can be significantly limited when offering is opened.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure, as well as for the labelling, safe storage and secrecy of tenders, restrict manipulative possibilities such as: For example, subsequent changes in tenders are significant.
In addition, the Contracting Parties responsible for opening tenders shall not carry out any other tasks relating to the performance to be awarded.
The overall few complaints show a high level of acceptance of the requirements for opening tenders.
Examination and evaluation of tenders
Verification and evaluation of tenders The contracting entity shall examine and evaluate the tenders available on the opening date.
It shall determine the tender for the award of the contract which best meets the requirements set out in the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of tenderers must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Participation in the procurement procedure shall in principle be excluded from undertakings which: B. are legally convicted of bribery offences.
Tenders from non-excluded tenderers shall be examined in a computational, technical and economic manner and assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The contracting entity must determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices must be examined in particular by the customer.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly tampering phase of the award procedure.
For example, tenderers may be ruled out unfairly or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
By preferring or discriminating to bidders, the result of the value can be unduly affected, thus preventing the determination of the economically most economically advantageous offer.
The awarding authority must therefore take specific steps to ensure that the persons responsible for testing and evaluation meet the integrity and expertise requirements.
It must also ensure the transparency and compatibility of the procedure and of the decisions taken.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar arrangements
In line with the EU's requirements, tenders in both countries must be examined and assessed in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the evidence of suitability of the undertakings and the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the procurement documents and can no longer be altered during the procedure.
Once the bidder has been examined, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of tenders.
The allocation shall be limited to the award criteria.
The tenders submitted must, first of all, be formally examined as soon as possible in order to determine whether they are complete and whether in them: For example, there are abnormalities that might indicate possible manipulation intentions.
Where tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they shall be informed thereof without delay.
If the evaluation of tenders gives an unreasonably low price, the tenderer must be given an opportunity to comment before possible exclusion of his tender.
Decisions taken in the examination and evaluation of tenders shall be documented without delay.
Divergent arrangements
In Germany, tenders to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing.
The verification of tenders and the computational examination of tenders may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It shall use only staff members who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further audit and evaluation tasks is not further regulated.
If professional activities are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers in a confidential manner.
They may only make proposals for decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, procurement committees shall be set up to examine and evaluate the tenders.
The committees shall draw up evaluation reports with proposals for award.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the procurement procedures.
If evidence or statements required in Germany for the submission of tenders are filed incomplete, the awarding authority shall give tenderers the opportunity to record the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, can the offer be excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanation.
If a tenderer fails to do so, it must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the overall price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the tenders must also be examined.
Where, on the basis of the price structure of the tender, there is evidence of too low or too high prices for partial services, the tenderer shall be required to remove these ambiguities.
If it fails to do so and the Contracting Authority may demonstrate that the prices are mixed, this offer shall be excluded.
This is intended to prevent tenderers from speculating on substantial changes in the volume of partial services in the calculation of their supply, allowing significant increases in costs in construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the overall price is calculated but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A compound calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Tenders with excessively high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
Where one or more tenders are less than 10% or more of the corresponding price determination of the contracting entity or of the remaining tenderers' bids, tenderers shall demonstrate the correct calculus tion of their bids.
Where this is not possible, the contracting authority may exclude the tenders concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the invitation to tender may be revoked after the assessment of profitability if only tenders with non-justifiable prices are available.
Contrary to German procurement law, the contract cannot therefore be refused in the case of offers with prices substantially higher than the calculation of the contracting entity.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive conduct in Germany, the contracting authority shall immediately report to its expert supervisor.
The latter shall decide on the measures to be taken and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor.
The supervisory authority must, for example,: For example, even in the case of works over 50,000 Euros, if freely awarded, an award is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or the invitation to tender should be cancelled.
There are no corresponding regulations in the Czech Republic.

BRH
Suitability and value criteria
The vast number of award procedures examined was in line with the requirements set out above.
In the case of some companies proposed by professionals, the contracting authorities did not themselves verify the suitability of the undertakings.
An award recipient commissioned undertakings without the required proof of suitability in full.
In some proceedings, it was not clear whether the awarding authority took into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision or whether it had merely laid down the "price" criterion for its award decision.
Selection of persons involved and confidentiality of tenders
Some contracting authorities used non-authorised persons when examining the tenders for this purpose.
For example, freelance persons carried out activities or staff involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project of the Department, which were carried out only by employees of the Contracting Authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the professionals responsible for examining the tenders also contributed to employees who were not obliged to keep the tenders secret and to the conscientious fulfilment of contractual concerns.
In most cases, it was not clear for the construction services whether the offers were only accessible to those directly responsible for processing.
Prudence and computational verification of tenders
Some contracting authorities handed over the open tenders to professional professionals for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed inspection of the tenders and the computational examination itself and prescribed their results.
In the event of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the tenders without having been satisfied with the contracting authorities.
In the documents examined, striking or missing price or product information was in part not marked or was not sufficiently marked.
Economic efficiency check
In the case of a sample in a superstructure management, the most favourable tenders for three quarters of the award procedures examined decreased more than 10% from the estimated costs previously determined.
Every twentieth award procedure has been cancelled due to inappropriate tender prices.
Not all bidding tests and reconnaissance talks with bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
There was often a lack of further reconnaissance, such as at the unit prices of the main positions.
The deviations were often justified only on a flat-rate basis, e.g. For example, by indicating changes in market prices or increased material costs.
Construction departments stated that detecting and proving compound calculations was difficult.
In the case of an invitation to tender by an institution of public law, the tender price of the most favourable tender was 66% lower than the previously established estimate value of those services.
Further calculation tests or studies on the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a reconnaissance meeting, the awarding agency did not find any evidence of price dumping by the company then commissioned.
This left it unclear whether the estimated estimate value increased or the offer price was too low.
Later, the contracting entity assessed the commissioned company as a "low-cost company," which could not hold quality or deadlines.
In the case of another invitation to tender, a construction service awarded the tender to a tender the price of which was 35% higher than the value of the cost assessment.
It did not lift the invitation to tender, arguing that the company could be closed to a foreign calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities in an audit of construction management, both of which were reported to the expert supervisor.
In one of the cases, in the case of an invitation to tender, the calculation of two tenderers was identical, so the contracting authority excluded both tenders from the procedure.
In the application of the other rules, the tests did not produce any material complaints.
NK Ú
Aptitude test
In the case of many of the projects under examination, including higher education, road construction and the development of the railway network, the contracting agencies did not exclude tenderers from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not demonstrate their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in a case a contracting authority could not prove or explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had complied with the requirements.
Evaluation
When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the awarding authority did not take into account the criteria laid down for the assessment and evaluation of tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the development of the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the value criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road conservation measures, a procedure misinterpreted the prescribed criterion "reduction of the construction phase."
This resulted in insufficient account being taken of the proposed reduction in bidders at second and third positions.
Documentation of the offer selection
In the case of three award procedures under the promotion of housing, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and on the basis of which it had selected the successful tenderer.
When building a motorway, the Contracting Authority selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 Euros solely due to telephone surveys at prices and delivery conditions.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The rules for examining and evaluating tenders are in line with EU requirements in both countries.
However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective rules differ from one another.
In Germany, detailed requirements in particular for the implementation of the more-eyes principle and for the protection of tenders will make the procedure more regulated than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the provisions on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be assessed.
In both countries, some of the award procedures examined had to find that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or were insufficient to document.
However, possible manipulative interventions are encouraged without the compatibility and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions.
A particularly serious defect was the transfer of all tenders to third parties without the contracting authority having previously examined and documented the tenders sufficiently, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
When contracting authorities have tasks carried out in the examination and evaluation of tenders by third parties, sufficient arrangements and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of tampering.
In assessing the appropriateness of the prices, the audited services in Germany have not always taken full advantage of the specified instrument, and in doing so the price structure of the tenders has not been adequately examined.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose, in particular, in the assessment of suitability and in the application of the criteria of value.
Conclusion of the procurement procedure
Following the examination and value of the tenders, the award procedure shall be concluded by award of the contract or by cancellation of the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
Companies shall have the opportunity to examine the proposed award within 10 days or within 15 days of notification by electronic means or by fax or other means of communication and, where appropriate, to initiate a verification procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a tenderer makes a request for verification within the information period, a contract is only possible after the final decision has been taken in the verification procedure.
Companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court under this review procedure.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of the undertakings and to stop the contracting entity during the entire procurement procedure to comply with the procurement law.
To this end, he must document the procedure sufficiently.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar arrangements
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the Contracting Authority shall decide on the award of the award.
However, it must not arbitrarily deviate from the outcome of proper examination and evaluation of tenders.
The contracting entity shall award the contract within the time limit announced:
Also because the tenderers are no longer bound by their tenders after the expiry of the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted alerts, the contracting entity may not, in principle, derogate from the content of the tender at the conclusion of the contract.
The undergraduate tenderers shall be informed of the award decision and of the reasons for their failure to take account of its tenders in a timely manner.
Procurement procedures may be cancelled only subject to certain conditions, such as: For example, if the price of tenders is increased or if the tenders do not meet the requirements of the invitation to tender.
Divergent arrangements
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to provide information and maintenance for 10 and 15 days prior to award of the contract also exists in the case of works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to EU-wide concessions.
In the case of other procedures in Germany, tenderers may not be informed of the award decision until the award decision has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be set aside if only one tender has been received or only one tender has been accepted.
In Germany, the tender shall also be awarded in the case of only one valuable tender, provided that it complies with the conditions laid down in the invitation to tender and is economic.
Essential audit results
BRH
In the case of the awards examined, there were only a few complaints concerning the conclusion of the procurement procedures.
In part, companies received contract letters from EU-wide concessions before the expiry of the information periods, which may result in the Treaty being ineffective.
Also included contract letters according to open procedures in individual cases from the content of the offer, such as: For example, changed dates.
In several cases, contracting entities did not comply with the award deadlines.
In the case of an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the second most favourable tender, since an undertaking with a 50% cheaper tender after the expiry of the award period was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the originally offered price.
NK Ú
In the case of a construction measure in the higher education sector, the contracting authority in the contract deviated in content from the tenderer's offer.
In the case of some concessions, such as construction of road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting agencies concluded the contracts after the expiry of the statutory period.
When awarding works to renovate former military sites, the Contracting Authority did not assign the Award Notice to all tenderers until the expiry of the statutory deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented EU guidelines for the conclusion of the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of the submitted candidates or tenderers increases the instrumentarium of corruption prevention.
The scope of legal protection is also extended in Czech procurement law to include allowances below EU thresholds.
In both countries, the time limits for the award of contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of tampering.
In the future, construction administrations should avoid the identified shortcomings in the conclusion of their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The procurement procedures shall be documented in detail during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the justifications of each decision.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
Order data are also recorded in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption By documenting procurement procedures, a fundamental requirement of the EU wide transparency bid is implemented.
A careful and timely documentation allows for the comprehensibility of the award decisions.
It also serves, in particular, to protect tenderers effectively in the case of contracts above EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the need to give detailed reasons for procurement decisions significantly limits manipulation margins.
The notice of a contract awarded to an EU-wide procurement procedure shall be sent to the EU Official Publications Office within 48 days.
The Office shall publish the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thereby also implement the Transparency Bid.
Contracting authorities shall also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the relevant national ministries of the EU Commission.
On this basis, the EUKommission shall draw up an annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Rules of German and Czech procurement law
Equal or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Divergent arrangements
In the Czech Republic, the publication obligation for contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide concessions, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide concessions, there is an obligation to publish only in the case of restricted tenders and in the case of freemasons from limits of value of 25,000 euro or 15,000 euros without VAT on sales (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits and in the case of public procurement, only the undertakings involved in the competition procedure shall receive information on the contract releases.
Essential audit results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the award procedures examined were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as: For example, for the reasons of product specifications or for references to national regulations.
In the case of a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded a contract to an undertaking, although its tender had not necessarily included supporting documents to be accepted.
In a few cases the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Notices on Contract Releases
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting authorities failed to disclose the award of contracts.
In the case of further procurement procedures, evidence was missing that the contracting authorities had announced the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical data received contained the minimum information required. They had been created and sent on schedule.
Ex-postal transparency
In most cases, the audit authorities published the contract data of the concluded procurement procedures.
However, there was no publication of this data in a construction administration because of a transfer error.
The construction administration only noticed this error after half a year,
In such a way that the contract data of the procurement procedures concluded by then have not been published.
NK Ú
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the hosting of a large sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures had significant shortcomings. These were mainly incorrect information, such as false offer prices in the protocols of the valuation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the opening of tenders were not signed.
Notices on Contract Releases
In several road construction projects, notices of awarded contracts were only delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The regulations to the documentation and to the obligatory registrations and report duties agree in both countries extensively and move the EU default.
This ensures, in principle, the transparency of the procurement procedures, including the contract releases.
The rules to be applied to the notice in the Czech Republic go slightly further than those laid down in Germany.
The deficiencies in documentation and notices have been found to significantly limit the orruptional effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contract releases and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two priorities which are essential in the Czech Republic and in Germany for the award of works by contracting authorities: The application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The provisions of EU law allow cross-border competition to create a European single market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only used to avoid or at least reduce corruption. They are also intended to fend off economic damage and a potential loss of confidence in the integrity of government.
The audit knowledge of the two audit offices on the application of the procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of those rules, provides information on common ground and differences that may be useful for both countries in the development and application of their procurement rights.
Application of EU procurement rules
The EU's guidelines on the award of construction services have transposed both countries into national law.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of works and for taking into account the essential offers of competition, the equal treatment of the undertakings involved and the transparency of the procurement procedures.
The construction administrations of both countries have in some cases undermined these bids very extensively by further administrative provisions.
The Czech Republic has largely transferred the guidelines on works to be awarded across the EU to its national regulatory procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the audit offices' investigations have revealed that construction administrations have not fully complied with EU law requirements in all areas.
Construction management in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to eliminate the complaints that have been revealed when implementing EU requirements.
The tests in the Czech Republic have mainly highlighted risks affecting the cost-effectiveness of the allowances.
Thus incomplete performance descriptions made additional benefits necessary, which were often awarded in violation of legislation. In addition, cost investigations were mostly inadequate. Overt qualification requirements also reduced the number of possible bidders and, in particular, restricted competition in transport buildings.
Corruption prevention
The investigations did not aim to expose corruption cases,
Also because the accounting offices do not have an appropriate instrument for this purpose.
The audit offices may, however, examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have made arrangements against corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these provisions are applied.
In the prevention of corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
The German rules provide, above all, for largely unlimited competition, as well as transparency and controls as key elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech rules aim primarily at increasing transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the guidelines for the award of construction services and are designed to meet their specific requirements.
The relevant rules set out in part the way in which the anti-corruption bids should be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the BRH's view, in particular, the priority of the principle of open procedure or public tender is an appropriate instrument in order to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analyses and sufficient controls (especially the more-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective arrangements to prevent corruption and manipulation.
Therefore, the BRH does not see any fundamental need for change in the corresponding requirements of the administrations for the award of works.
Corruption prevention schemes are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in sub-areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some requirements.
Construction administrations should continue to train their employees on the anti-corruption guidelines and raise their awareness of this problem.
A substantial part of the complaints referred to tasks delegated by the construction administrations to professional professionals.
However, without checks and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases in the delegation of tasks.
Tampering and corruption-prone tasks should therefore be entrusted to third parties only if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against unlawful intervention.
NK Ú
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption in which the field of public procurement is the most important component.
The Procurement Act and its implementing rules have been substantially amended.
The NKÚ audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legislative provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, since the awarding agencies must establish the cost-effectiveness of the contract releases, the calculation of the prices to be expected, the appropriateness of the qualification requirements, the essential assessment criteria and the nature of the assessments and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU guidelines in principle positively.
The broad acceptance in practice has confirmed that EU offers of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union may also serve as the basis for similar projects aimed at enabling and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both accounting firms are called upon the construction authorities in their countries to continue their actions against corruption and manipulation and, if necessary, to improve them.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of the procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased as open procedures provide a wider space for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A stronger division of works in lots can also have a favourable impact on supply prices, provided that greater competition is achieved with a higher number of tenderers.
Ensuring the proper implementation of the procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient procurement activities of contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialized construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of road transport projects - carry out the corporate functions themselves or contractors appointed by them.
The accounting offices of both countries are concerned, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the relevant findings for them and, if necessary, to refer them to Parliament and Government of their country.
Both audit offices also believe that the principles of procurement law and their implementation set out in this report are also of interest at international level to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI). The principles and findings set out above are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and in order to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
