Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The role of the state is to make the most economical and economical use of public funds and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU member states have to transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The awarding of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Because of the inherently high potential for damage, contracting authorities are therefore required to take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and improper favours in the award of their contracts.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits on both the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national legislation, as well as on the prevention of corruption in the award of works in building construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
Procurement below the EU thresholds has also been included in the considerations with a view to preventing corruption.
The results of the audit of both courts are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report will also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are predominantly based on cross-sectional audits, which it carried out in the years 2011 / 2012 at the construction authorities, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large-scale building projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The audits covered construction measures in road construction, railway infrastructure construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is mainly carried out by the construction administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, the awarding of contracts is carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budget resources.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved for parts of the award procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and in the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Structure of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national procurement, many complementary individual rules are laid down by internal administrative provisions,
such as the so-called "Procurement Handbooks" of the Federal Government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in compliance with public procurement law case law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal provisions applicable to both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the management of public funds, allowed for greater competition and limited the scope for corruption in the procurement process.
Broad outlines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure apply in particular to EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold are subject to the national types of award (public tender, restricted tender, hands-free award), which largely correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide types of award.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of open procedure (for contracts to be awarded throughout the EU) and public tendering (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender process, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
For this purpose, above all, the division of an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots serves.
The individual awarding of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above-mentioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law provides, in line with EU law, that contracts should be concluded when competition is ensured and a favourable price is achieved.
Current legislation in the Czech Republic allows contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts awarded in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros were allocated to public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and highway construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction works in the building construction and highway construction of the federal government was distributed among the award types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiated procedures and private tenders.
Of these, 33.2% were pan-European contracts.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 4.7 billion in 2011, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, which represented 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for volumes below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public procurement authorities in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on an important part of public procurement, that the prevention of corruption, which must be observed in all procurement procedures, is of great financial importance and that the open procedure and the public procurement procedure play a prominent role in the award of the contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their respective countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of the two Court of Auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
The main findings were as follows:
The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the procurement regulations of both countries also serve to prevent corruption, some of which differ in their focus and in their detail (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement of the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for the proper preparation of tenders.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not contain any requirements that restrict competition.
In Germany, the award documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to sufficiently identify the object of the contract.
In Germany, construction works are to be divided into lots if possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, in particular in the field of road construction, the NKÚ found that the award of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots may distort competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and carry the risk of price or other agreements.
In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted to provide additional or modified services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and closed procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the statutory and budgetary primacy of the open procedure for EU-wide procurement or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national procurement, applies.
This will allow more companies to bid.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price-fixing between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited works administrations tendered the works in principle throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used to calculate the costs of public buildings, in particular in building construction,
which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).
In the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published in order to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to prepare for the planned contracts at an early stage.
As a rule, the audited building authorities complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates to participate in non-public procurement procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and must be announced in advance.
In addition to the EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should switch as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are in some cases very detailed requirements in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (point 4.4).
In both countries, in the interest of a level playing field, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in submitting bids receive the same information during the bidding phase.
Contact between these companies and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, some of the audited building administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
In opening up offers in both countries, the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency must be observed in particular.
The specifications for the labelling, documentation, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers are intended to restrict scope for manipulation and are laid down in particular detail in Germany.
The tests carried out in both countries resulted in only a few complaints (point 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the bids are defined in both countries by guidelines for the organisation of the structure and process.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over tenders to third parties for examination without first reviewing the tenders and adequately documenting any abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (point 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide tendering procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the envisaged award of the contract before the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU public procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to observe the prescribed deadlines when awarding contracts or deviate from the bidders "offer in terms of content (point 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible with the audited building administrations in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement has not been sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Also, some of the shortcomings identified diminished the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries complied to a large extent with their reporting and reporting obligations (point 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the member states.
The general tendering principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment, the principle of non-discrimination and the principle of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for works to be awarded across the EU for construction projects.
For this purpose, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed a current volume of 5,000,000 euros.
The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of candidates and the Remedies Directive provides the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, the companies concerned can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union Directives into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hamper competition and lead to significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
The prevention of corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.
They have to check the structure and operation of their administrations for areas particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption there.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and corruption, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations for the prevention of corruption12 in the Federal Administration. According to this guideline, in addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed in particular for the award area: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and accounting, precise and complete documentation of the award procedures.
In addition, other anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement legislation.
For example, the responsible Federal Ministry for Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system in 2011,
with the assignment data − such as the estimated costs and the order sums − as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected nationwide and evaluated for any abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The statutory requirements of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of any form of discrimination, are the most important foundations for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in an anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement legislation and related administrative legislations14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are: lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, mandatory prior notification of contracts by the contracting authority, including indication of the reasons for tendering, prohibition of restricting the number of tenderers in non-open procedures and thus eliminating the possibility of selecting tenderers by lottery, introduction of the obligation to publish contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and list of subcontractors.
Results of the examination of the individual stages of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information required by the bidders for the proper preparation of a bid.
In particular, the award documents must enable an accurate calculation to be made.
Bidders must not be entrusted with risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for public procurement documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.
The service description must in principle be product-neutral.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
The avoidance of anti-competitive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as it opens up scope for speculation in the preparation of the bids and for manipulation of their valuation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations In both countries, EU legal requirements on technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be advertised in a product-neutral manner without manufacturer specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must, as a rule, be subdivided into service units with respective quantities.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may benefits be defined by functional targets.
The service descriptions must in any case be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation according to lump sums or time expenditure is to be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to put an end to speculation and manipulation based on vague specifications in the award documents.
The service specifications must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Different rules
There is no obligation to tender works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public contracting authorities may divide construction work into several lots.
In Germany, construction works are generally to be divided into lots, separately according to the quantity (partial lots) and / or according to type or subject area (specialist lots).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be indicated in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
The aim is to make it fully and conclusively clear to applicants on the basis of which criteria their offers should be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in the EU-wide award procedures.
In the case of national award procedures, the evaluation criteria are only to be set out in an internal administrative award note.
Procurement documents drawn up by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or appraisers in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the knowledge of the client.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send out award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which turn out to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award supplements to the company already contracted, without the need for a tender procedure with public notice.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration for supplementary services may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services may not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to the award of such contracts without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of a delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.
If supplementary services are also assigned to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
When determining the remuneration for the additional services, it must rather be based on the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.
Key audit results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the performance specifications contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance specifications also contained product-related specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product could be considered.
List of benefits broken down by sub-services
In none of the examined proceedings has the BRH found violations of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of the service specifications
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
For some procedures, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance sheets contained items where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such demand items.
Lots and scoring criteria
With many assignments the prescribed reason was missing, why the achievements tendered predominantly after specialized ones were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no objections in the indication of the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to self-employed workers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Some of their names were on the cover pages or in attached plans or expert opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked applicants to contact the architect "on questions relating to the tender process."
In the building construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the above-mentioned complaints predominantly to omissions on the part of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the performance specifications.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity to adequately control the specifications of the services.
New York
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering During the public procurement process for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service specification.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justification.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance specifications with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the service specifications.
As performance units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the service specifications
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the specifications were amended four times during a closed procedure between August and September 2009,
because the scope of services had significantly increased and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary structural studies and incomplete design drawings, which meant additional services had to be commissioned.
In the case of the construction of a large library building, the specifications of the interior equipment did not contain any product quality requirements.
As a result of this lack of specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Lots and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of works into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that savings of up to 31.6 million euros out of a total cost of 620.3 million euros would have been possible if selected parts had been awarded in batches.
In the case of six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved if they had been awarded in batches.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded separately, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total award.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
In the case of the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders in an open procedure, inter alia, to provide evidence of at least three completed road construction projects, each worth EUR 28 million over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway consisted of six separate construction projects, for which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least €480 million over the last three years as an eligibility criterion for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds allocated to road projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. €2.5 billion out of a total of €3.7 billion) were for contracts awarded by a total of five companies, which carried out the contracts alone or as a joint venture.
Out of 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of €528 million, only two or even only one bidder submitted an offer.
The NKÚ pointed out that a narrowing of the market potential can result in significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures required by law when awarding additional services in two cases, nor did it conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, supplements of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) were incurred in the first case and up to EUR 165.4 million (net) in the second case, which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
In the case of several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.
Although the volume of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the initial contract value set out in national public procurement law, the contracting authority carried out negotiated procedures with the contracting companies without publication of the contract.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiated procedures without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The standard prices for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a random audit of construction projects, NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.
In Germany, on the other hand, according to an analysis of long-term data by the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly in line in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both to ensure comprehensive and fair competition and to prevent corruption.
For example, the requirement that the service descriptions be sufficiently specific should enable bidders to calculate and draw up their offers in an appropriate manner,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon retrospectively and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and opportunities for manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency will be increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for performance specifications have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, derogations have had to be complained about, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The existing requirement in Germany for the formation of lots promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots may result in restrictions on the field of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements imposed in the Czech Republic for road construction have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow group of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
With regard to the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.
According to the EU requirements as well as the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a procurement procedure with public notice.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in a negotiated procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
This limit is often exceeded,
as the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently defined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be put out to tender with a public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It may leave the circle of possible candidates and bidders largely unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by imposing non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be followed.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority has to take into account, in particular, the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction works of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction works must in principle be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all works contracts.
A uniform construction project may not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to award construction services on a Europe-wide basis.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award as well as the examination of the application of the EU public procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on procurement procedures and thresholds into national law.
Different rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its public works contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. However, other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national contracts - the public procurement procedure generally takes precedence. This is laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of award - such as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender procedure - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be justified and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by targeting specific bidders and to make possible price-fixing between bidders more difficult.
In Germany, the principle of public tendering is a key element in preventing corruption.
The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the likely costs in the area of public building construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost characteristics for building categories, usage units, building elements or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost indicators, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction are only available to some building administrations in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price calculations of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated costs of works.
In most cases, the cost calculations are based on estimates by the funding body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were given the task of creating a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
This database is intended to collect information on material expenditure and construction and finishing works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable costs to be determined and uniform prices to be determined.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects in order to better control costs,
which will be used as a benchmark when setting prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key test results BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited contracting authorities tendered the works to a large extent in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus complied with the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the construction work carried out by the Federal Government in the field of building construction was put out to tender either publicly or in an open procedure.
In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.
The choice of non-public procurement methods partly lacked detailed reasons as to why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional study, based on more than 16,000 public procurement procedures, the BRH found that non-public procurement methods have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as for open-ended tenders.
The investigation also showed that the offer prices for restricted tenders and open tenders were on average 6% and 10% higher respectively than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a State Audit Office confirmed the differences in profitability between public and non-public types of procurement.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
As a rule, the audited contracting authorities drew up procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had determined an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, in which they defined the works to be awarded according to EU-wide and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction work was always to be awarded across the EU.
There was no circumvention of the obligation to award EU-wide contracts by under-estimating costs.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell below this level.
During the construction process, some contracting authorities improperly changed the definitions of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be respected.
For most of the works audited, the proportion of EU-wide contracts awarded according to the settlement results was generally lower than envisaged under the procurement plan.
In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities failed to comply with the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros or more of the single lots in EU-wide procedures,
and chose national procedures instead.
New York
Choice of type of award
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction work into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these allocations, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated contract value
In the field of road construction, the existing price databases for this sector were an insufficient tool for determining the expected order values.
The data was based on construction projects that had just been completed, but in which there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values calculated using the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.
The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimated values.
The estimated price for the conversion or extension of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed contract value, but eight supplements in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27%.
Similarly, the actual value of the contract for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased even while construction was being carried out.
In the case of the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately by 139%, as the usable area had only increased by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU regulations determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line with each other.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the requirements of the EU and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, public procedures or public tenders give more companies the opportunity to participate in competition.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not limiting the field of candidates by tampering with the contracting authority's definitions and by making it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in procedures with a previous competition.
Thus the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been allocated inappropriately in order to circumvent the requirements for the selection of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold value, errors had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a fall below the minimum share of benefits advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the estimated costs of works and construction projects.
If necessary, the construction authorities should carry out further checks to ensure that the requirements for the selection of the type of contract and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions are created for appropriate cost calculations.
Preliminary information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for works where the estimated total value of the contract exceeds or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the tendering periods for open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client is obliged to provide further details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardised throughout Europe, is to be used.
Preliminary information and notices will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the contracting authority.
In order to avoid discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the text of the notice has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and, where appropriate, may even encourage manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on pre-notification and notification into national law.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published in the case of works not to be awarded on a European scale.
Procurement procedures may start at the earliest one month after sending the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (in the case of EU-wide contracts) or the national Official Journal (in the case of all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of preliminary information be waived.
In Germany, no prior information is required in the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions prior to restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Internet portal and, where applicable, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without a competition, notices of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the loose building contracts.
The impact of this scheme is limited in the Czech Republic, where much less construction work is divided into lots.
Key audit results
BRH.
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened the deadlines for bids, even though the 52-day period between the sending of the preliminary information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of validity of the prior information had already expired and before it was extended.
In many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned division of construction work into lots.
Announcements
Some of the notices issued by the audited bodies contained CPV codes which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately capture the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information - for example on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited construction authority had entrusted a service company with the publication of the national procurement procedures.
The company published the notifications on its own paid procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the notifications to the free internet portal of the federal government as prescribed.
Samples showed that only one third of the notifications of the audited administration were published on this portal.
New York
Announcements
In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it intended to select the bidders.
The contracting authority was not able to prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was allowed under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in a non-open procedure, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure that it would assess the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it intended to admit to the competition.
In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because it did not disclose information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of the notices
During the renovation of the former military site, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with advance information and notice is an important element in implementing the requirement for transparency in Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the area of national procurement:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
Unlike public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures do not allow every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance of which companies should be invited to tender.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption EU rules allow for a limit on the number of candidates in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are to be invited to tender.
At least three companies must be invited to participate in a negotiated procedure with a contract notice.
In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example by giving unilateral preferential treatment to certain companies.
In addition, the restriction of competition to a small number of companies also favours possible collusion between candidates.
In both cases, the award result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules governing the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, contracting authorities should, when selecting applicants, switch among the companies to be requested as often as possible.
Nor must competition be limited to companies established in certain regions.
The awarding bodies must justify the selection of candidates and document the course of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Different rules
In Germany, at least three suitable applicants must be invited to tender in the case of restricted tenders and, in the case of hands-free tenders, in principle several suitable applicants must be invited to tender.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in non-open and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be taken into account when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of undertakings for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or an agent from the contracting authority will normally have to amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed undertaking and / or supplementing a new undertaking.
This is to prevent a single person from being able to conclusively determine the group of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the event of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching collusion between the parties.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially, including with regard to freelancers, and must not be made publicly available.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
In the Czech Republic, there are no such rules for drawing up and keeping lists of candidates secret.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only make proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation on this issue.
Key audit results
BRH.
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to tender for non-public contracts has been met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation by the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide tendering procedures for construction services in building construction revealed that the contracting authorities in Germany invited an average of 6.6 companies to tender for restricted tenders and an average of 4.4 companies to tender for open-ended tenders.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular in the case of trades with few providers, the awarding bodies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and tried and tested from their point of view.
The reason given was that, in the case of non-public proceedings, it was necessary to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete before the invitation to tender was issued.
The BRH did not find an undue restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally established companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that, on average, the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is much smaller and therefore, for example, longer travel distances are more important than in public tenders.
More-eyes-principle and suggestions of freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by a lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to bid.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of candidates and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves from possible manipulation to the extent required.
Confidential treatment of bidder lists
In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of the companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system which could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the event of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and could, for example, have facilitated collusion between these companies.
Documentation
Only in a few cases did the documentation of the award procedures contain reasons for the selection of candidates.
New York
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, bidders were not provided with information on the evaluation criteria and procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not indicate how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a lottery procedure to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multiple-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements limit such opportunities for abuse.
In the case of the Czech schemes, the newly introduced requirement of a largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have not been sufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation to restrict the number of participants in these cases has not been sufficiently reduced.
The contracting authorities should fully address the shortcomings identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, the bidding phase begins, during which companies can draw up bids on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Candidates may submit their bids by the expiry of the offer period set by the registry.
The requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this stage of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities will have to comply with the national rules designed to counteract the potential for manipulation during the tender phase.
These are above all organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The award documents, on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their bids, are, in principle, to be sent only by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants also receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In the event of any ambiguity in the award documents or any other questions relating to the call for tenders, only the registry may provide information to the candidates.
Freelancers in charge of drawing up the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants is to be prevented.
The self-employed must not become a hub of the procurement process through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Bids sent by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have to show a technical encryption.
Different rules
In Germany, the registry may also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to diligently fulfil the contractual obligations.
In Germany, the bids received must be marked with an entrance stamp and forwarded directly, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for safekeeping.
This official may not be involved in the award of the contract.
The offers received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received will be marked with a reference number.
The registry records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt data, in a protocol.
The safekeeping of offers is not regulated in more detail in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH.
The audits at the tender stage focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building construction administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The contracting authorities of the audited building administration sent out the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent out by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send out procurement documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the audited building administration did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding of contracts when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, it did not name employees from the contracting authority, but from the project managers as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had drawn up the performance specifications.
When enquiries were made during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Marking of the offers
At the audited building administration, all tenders received were marked with an input stamp and an input note.
In the case of some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for preventing corruption.
Storage of the offers
Once identified, not all tenders were sent directly and immediately to the safekeeping officer, who locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, tenders had been filed at a construction site in an open compartment of the post office to which every member of staff had access.
Another department had hung up a letterbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers that had been placed there even remained overnight.
Since the slot in this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to take bids received and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
New York
No deficiencies were complained about on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and professionals involved in the procurement process will be prevented in particular in both countries.
Furthermore, by providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should be respected.
The regulations on the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers appear to be suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed breaches of the rules in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up the offers
Opening up the offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders are bound by their bids until the end of the award period set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal provisions for the opening up of the offers.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement process, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive requirements to protect bids and competition.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the registry.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only bids submitted to the negotiator at the time of the opening of the first offer are allowed to open.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer shall be recorded in a protocol which shall include, inter alia, the names of the bidders and the offer prices.
The minutes are to be read out and signed by the head of the negotiations.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of tenders.
Freelancers can also participate in this process.
The Committee may also be charged with other phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The chief negotiator must be an official of the tendering body.
The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in building construction, also the secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the award and execution of the contract.
According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date must contain not only the offer prices, but also information on discounts and discounts, as well as special features such as damaged or late offers.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's authority to sign are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.
There are no corresponding Czech regulations.
If only one offer is received in an award procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received here, it is to be opened and then evaluated.
Key audit results
BRH.
Multi-eye principle
The audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who were not in charge of any other procurement procedures.
In the case of freelance contracts with a smaller scope of services, however, there were isolated cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the involvement of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, late tenders were not registered, and in some cases signatures were even missing.
Marking of the offers
The contracting authorities examined as part of the cross-sectional audit marked the bids in accordance with the specifications by perforating them with the date of the opening date.
More recent audits of some beneficiaries have found inadequate labelling.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
New York
Offer deadline
With regard to the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was not received by the contracting authority until one month after the end of the offer period. Nevertheless, the contracting authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries for the opening of the bids agree in significant parts. They take into account both the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency. Thus, the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of the bids can be substantially limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly limit the possibilities for manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those entrusted with the opening of tenders may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
All in all, only a few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.
Review and evaluation of the offers
Review and evaluation of offers The client shall examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
It shall determine the tender for the award of the contract which best meets the requirements in accordance with the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU benchmarks provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially capable and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies which, for example, have a final conviction for bribery or fraud are to be excluded from participation in the award procedure.
The bids of the not excluded bidders are to be examined mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly manipulation-prone phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders may be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvantaging bidders, the evaluation result can be impermissibly impaired and thus the identification of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons in charge of the audit and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and of the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries are to be assessed and evaluated in a multi-stage process.
The requirements for the companies "proof of suitability to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.
Once the suitability of the bidder has been checked, the suitability criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The evaluation shall be limited to the award criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be formally examined immediately as to whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible intentions to manipulate them.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they shall be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the bids results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his bid.
The decisions made during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Different rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.
Only the registry may carry out the review of the bids and the computational examination of the bids.
It shall only appoint officials who are not involved in the award decision or in the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in more detail.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of a bid in Germany are only partially submitted, the registry shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is to be excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether to give tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the standard prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.
If, as a result of the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are set too low or too high, the bidder is to be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If it does not succeed in this and the registry can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer is to be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating in the calculation of their offer on significant changes in the volume of partial services, which can result in significant increases in the costs of the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Bids with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
If one or more offers fall short of the applicable price calculation of the principal or the bid totals of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders shall prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders may be withdrawn after a cost-effectiveness assessment if only tenders with unjustifiable low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, tenders with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation cannot be refused for this reason.
If there is suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its specialist supervisory authority at the leading level.
It will have to decide what measures to take and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office.
For example, if a contract is to be awarded freely, if a contract is not to be awarded to the tender with the lowest price, or if the call for tenders is to be rescinded, the specialist supervisory authority at the leading level must also give its consent for works over 50,000 euros.
There are no such rules in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH.
Suitability and scoring criteria
The vast majority of audited procurement procedures were in line with the requirements set out above.
In the case of some companies proposed by freelancers, contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the published award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the criterion of "price."
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used persons who were not authorised to do so in the examination of tenders.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this on the grounds of insufficient staff capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to examine the offers also included employees who were not obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to diligently fulfil their contractual obligations.
For the construction services it was in most cases also not comprehensible whether the offers of the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Review and accounting review of the offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the opened offers to freelancers for further examination without first having carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination themselves and having documented their results.
In the event of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the bids without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the examined documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partially not or only insufficiently marked.
Performance audits
In a sample in a building administration, in three quarters of the procurement procedures examined, the most favourable offers deviated more than 10% from the estimated costs previously determined.
One out of every 20 procurement procedures has been cancelled because of inappropriate offer prices.
Not all bid reviews and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases there was a lack of further clarification, such as on the unit prices of the most important items.
Frequently, the deviations were justified only across the board, for example by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building services said it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of a call for tenders by a public institution, the offer price of the most favourable offer was 66% below the previously determined estimated value of these services.
Further calculation checks or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a fact-finding meeting, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction agency awarded the contract to a tender whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost assessment.
It did not annul the call for tenders, citing the irrelevant reasoning that an adequate calculation could be concluded in the case of that company.
Suspicion of irregularities
In an audited building management, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the specialist supervisory level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders in a tender was identical, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant objections.
New York
Aptitude test
In many of the construction projects examined, including higher education, road construction and the extension of the rail network, contracting authorities did not exclude tenderers from the procedure even though they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had met the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take the given evaluation criteria into account when examining and evaluating the bids.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.
As a result, the bidders in second and third position did not take sufficient account of the reduction offered.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures within the framework of the housing promotion, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of the offers correspond in both countries to the requirements of the EU.
However, when it comes to details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ.
In Germany, the procedure is regulated to a greater extent than in the Czech Republic due to detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered is to be assessed.
In both countries, in some of the procurement procedures examined, it was found that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or only insufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all tenders to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently reviewed and documented the tenders in advance, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If contracting authorities have tasks performed by third parties in the examination and evaluation of tenders, sufficient precautions and increased control efforts are required in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the available instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose in particular with regard to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the award procedure
After examining and valuing the bids, the award procedure will be concluded by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
Companies have the possibility to verify the intended award within 10 days if notified electronically or by fax, or within 15 days for other means of communication, and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, it is only possible to conclude a contract after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review procedure.
The purpose of the review procedure is to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the contracting authority to comply with public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
To do so, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The contracting authority shall award the contract within the announced award period,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may in principle not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The losing bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking their bids into account.
Procurement procedures may only be revoked under certain conditions, for example if the bid prices are excessive or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to inform and wait for 10 or 15 days prior to the award of the contract also applies to works that are not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide contracts.
For the other procedures in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the contract has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tender procedure has to be terminated if only one bid has been received or only one bid could be evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable bid, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key audit results
BRH.
In the case of the audited contracts, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, EU-wide contracts were awarded to companies even before the information deadlines expired, which can lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In individual cases, order letters according to open procedures also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not respect the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract to the second most favourable offer, since a company with a 50% lower offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the award period had expired.
New York
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.
For some contracts, for example for road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the legal deadline.
When awarding works for the rehabilitation of former military sites, the contracting authority forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders only after the expiry of the statutory deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements at the end of the procurement process.
The legal protection of the losing candidates or bidders will increase the tools for preventing corruption.
In Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to contracts awarded below the EU thresholds.
Both countries have been found to have exceeded the deadlines for awarding contracts.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Public works authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified when concluding their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.
The order data will also be recorded in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
Carefully and promptly prepared documentation only makes it possible to trace the award decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for tenderers in the case of contracts awarded above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to give detailed reasons for awarding contracts considerably restricts the scope for manipulation.
The notification of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent by the relevant contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual EU statistics, through which it can obtain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are broadly the same in both countries.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to the other award procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide awards, there is an obligation to publish only in the case of restricted invitations to tender and in the case of hands-free awards above value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without value added tax (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure will receive information on the award of contracts.
Key audit results
BRH.
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national rules.
In a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Notices on award of contracts
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting authorities failed to publicise the award of contracts.
Further procurement procedures failed to provide evidence that the contracting authorities had made public the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical statements viewed contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a construction management company did not publish this data due to a transmission error.
The building management only noticed this error after half a year,
so that the contract data of the procurement procedures completed up to that date have not been published.
New York
Documentation
There were considerable shortcomings in the documentation of the awarding procedures for the construction of a major sporting event, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the valuation committees.
In addition, some minutes of the opening of the offer were not signed.
Notices on award of contracts
In the case of several road projects, procurement notices have been published only late or not at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
This will, in principle, ensure the transparency of procurement procedures, including the awarding of contracts.
The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for notification go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the notices partially significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFT blank
Public works administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and award of contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits carried out by NKÚ and BRH have focused on two main areas which are essential for the award of works by contracting authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow for cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent or at least reduce corruption; they are also intended to prevent economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these rules, reveal similarities and differences which may help both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU requirements for the award of works have been transposed into national law by both countries.
This provides an important common basis in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works and for taking into account the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and transparency of procurement procedures.
The building administrations of both countries have underpinned these bids in part very extensively by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transferred the requirements for works to be awarded across the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the Court of Auditors' investigations have shown that public works administrations have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the objections raised when implementing the EU requirements.
In particular, the audits carried out in the Czech Republic have highlighted risks affecting the economic viability of the award of contracts.
For example, incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in violation of legal provisions. Furthermore, cost calculations were often insufficiently prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport construction.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations were not aimed at uncovering cases of corruption,
also because the courts of auditors do not have the tools to do so.
The Court of Auditors can, however, examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these requirements are applied.
The two countries have different priorities when it comes to preventing corruption.
In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech regulations is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH.
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the bids to prevent corruption are to be taken into account in the course of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (in particular the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of award procedures as well as various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules to prevent corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the targets.
The building authorities should further train their staff on the prevention of corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.
Without controls and adequate safeguards, however, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against undue interference.
New York
The Czech Republic adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which the area of public procurement is the most important element.
The Public Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The audits of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legislation should be effective improvement measures, as contracting authorities will have to justify the cost-effectiveness of awarding contracts, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
The recommendations
The NKÚ and BRH take a generally positive view of the implementation of the EU requirements.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at enabling and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and non-material damage potential caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the construction administrations in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of works into lots can also have a favourable effect on offer prices, provided that it leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient procurement activities of contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by specialised construction authorities. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The aim of the Courts of Auditors of both countries, even after the completion of their joint project, is to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to pass them on to the parliament and government of their country.
Both Courts of Auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.
