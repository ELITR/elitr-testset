Public procurement of works and corruption prevention
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and Overview
The award of services by public authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The task of the state is to use public funds as economically and sparingly as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by public authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure that competition is largely unrestricted across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (threshold values).
To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose and apply the EU's public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Because of the inherently high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore implement appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favouritism in the award of their contracts.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits for the EU-wide award of construction services as well as for the prevention of corruption.
The tests focused on the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as on the prevention of corruption in the award of construction works in civil engineering, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds have also been taken into account with regard to corruption prevention.
The audit results of both courts of auditors are summarised in this joint report.
The report is also aimed at international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
The evaluations of the Bundesrechnungshof on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests, which it carried out in the years 2011/2012 with the building authorities, which are responsible for the road construction and the building of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large-scale construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011, which included construction work in road construction, railway track construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is carried out primarily by the building authorities of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, the awarding of contracts is carried out on a decentralised basis by those bodies that use state budget resources.
In both countries, freelancers are also employed for part of the procurement procedures.
When juxtaposing the evaluations, differences in the procurement law and the market structure for construction services of both countries must be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures, limited to the national sphere, are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national procurement, many complementary individual schemes are provided by internal administrative provisions,
Such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the Federal Government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in compliance with the law on the award of contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the award procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other statutory provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the use of public funds, allowed for greater competition and limited opportunities for corruption in the award procedure.
Principles of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure are particularly applicable for EU-wide awards.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are subject to national tenders (public tenders, restricted tenders, hands-free contracts) which, however, largely correspond to these EU-wide tenders.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the priority of the open procedure (for contracts to be awarded throughout the EU) and the public tender (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company can make an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
For this purpose, the division of an overall construction measure into experts and non-participants serves above all.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
In Germany, there are more than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded when competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
Current legislation in the Czech Republic allows contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public tenderers and shares of tenders in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in civil engineering and trunk road construction (excluding railway track construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction works in the construction and trunk road construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders, and 6.6% negotiated procedures and hands-free contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were pan-European awards.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to EUR 7.8 billion, corresponding to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011:65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold of 2.7% other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded in 2011 by public procurement bodies.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel examinations of both countries are aimed at an important part of public procurement, which has a major financial impact on the prevention of corruption, which has to be taken into account in all contracts, and in the award of contracts, the open procedure and the public tender are of paramount importance.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of the two courts of auditors compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
In doing so, they found, in essence:
The EU directives on the award of works by public authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which differ in their focus and detail (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement of the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for the proper preparation of tenders.
The specifications must be neutral and must not be subject to anti-absorbing requirements.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the contract sufficiently.
In Germany, construction works must be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, particularly in the field of road construction, NKÚ found that the award of large-scale services without lots or with only very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and risk of price or other collusion.
According to the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were mostly followed in both countries.
According to the rules of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide tenders or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national tenders, applies.
This will allow more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes it difficult to negotiate prices between bidders and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction authorities generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.
Accurately estimating the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost data bases are used for the cost investigations of public buildings, in particular in the construction sector,
Which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements have to be published, which is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to prepare for the planned awards at an early stage.
As a rule, the approved building authorities complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries are to switch as frequently as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are some very detailed requirements in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, it is in the interest of fair competition to ensure that companies interested in making a bid receive the same information during the bidding phase.
Contact between these companies and freelancers involved in the production of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The approved building authorities in Germany, however, did not comply with these requirements in part (No. 4.5).
The opening of tenders in both countries must take into account, in particular, the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency.
The provisions on labelling, documentation, custody and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
In both countries, the examination and evaluation of the offers are determined by guidelines for the organisation of the structure and the sequence of events.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over bids for examination to third parties without first seeing through the bids and adequately documenting anomalies.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the intended appointment prior to the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corruptive behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to comply with the deadlines set for the award of the contract or deviate from the bidders" offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible in the case of the audited construction authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the corruption-preventing function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the procurement coordination and appeal directives, which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States.
The European Union's general principles of awarding contracts are, in particular, that of competition, equal treatment or non-discrimination, and that of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the procurement coordination directive sets out specific rules for construction works to be awarded throughout the EU.
In order to do this, their estimated order totals must reach or exceed 5,000,000 euros at present.
The regulations concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, including for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of the applicants and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, the companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.
Corruption prevention
The importance of corruption prevention
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
Which is usually caused by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
According to estimates, the global cost of corruption is 5% of global economic output.
For the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they have to review the organisation of their administrative structures and procedures in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption there.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corruptive abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as an area of work that is particularly vulnerable to corruption.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on the prevention of corruption12 in the Federal Administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed in the award area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, basic separation of planning, award and accounting, precise and complete documentation of the procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the procurement legislation.
In 2011, the competent Federal Ministry for Public Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,
With the award data - such as estimated costs and contract amounts - as well as information on the freelancers involved, it is collected across the board and evaluated for anomalies.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, are the most important bases for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been incorporated into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions by 14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are: lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, requiring the contracting authority to notify the tenders in advance, including naming the reasons for the tender, prohibiting the limitation of the number of tenderers in open procedures and thus eliminating the possibility of selecting tenders by means of lottery procedures, introducing the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, introducing the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Results of the examination of the various stages of the award procedure
Award documents
Procurement Documents The procurement documents must contain all the information that the bidders need in order to make an appropriate offer.
In particular, the award documents must allow for an accurate calculation.
Bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the description of the service and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proof of the qualification (ownership) of the bidders as well as the criteria, which are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The service description must, in principle, be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only allowed under strict conditions.
The avoidance of anti-competitive provisions in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of corruption prevention.
In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the award documents must be avoided, as it opens up scope for speculation in the creation of the tenders and for manipulation of their valuation.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Identical or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be tendered in a product-neutral manner without factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must, as a rule, be subdivided into performance units with respective quantities.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g., euros per m2 or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can benefits be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services that do not determine whether they are needed.
Compensation according to flat rates or according to time expenditure must be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their bids safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Diverging rules
There is no obligation to tender for construction works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be carried out, the public contracting authorities can subdivide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are to be divided into lots, separately according to the quantity (individual) and/or type or subject (individual).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make it more difficult to agree prices.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be specified in the award documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
The aim is for the applicants to be fully and conclusively aware of the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only mandatory in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the assessment criteria are only to be recorded in an administrative award notice.
Procurement documents, which are drawn up by commissioned freelancers, may not contain references to these offices or involved planners or surveyors in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge of the contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send out tender documents or to interpret planning documents for inspection.
Only the client is the contact person of the companies.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic on this.
Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (subsidies), almost always apply to large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of supplements to the company already contracted, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary performance may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services cannot be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to such an award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already under way.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already contracted company, under the regulations in Germany, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible.
The determination of the remuneration for the additional services is based on the agreed prices and on the basis of the price determination of the already issued order.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, minimum quantities cannot be charged with additional supplementary performance.
Key findings of the audit
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the specifications contained references to national technical approvals or standards, which had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection plates - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was eligible.
List of services subdivided by sub-services
In none of the cases examined, the BRH has found violations of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the tender documents were completed before the tenders began.
In some cases, the tender documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance lists contained positions where it was not determined whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such requirements.
Loose and scoring criteria
In the case of many contracts, there was no prescribed justification for the fact that the services, which were mainly advertised according to experts, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no objections to the indication of the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender."
In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the above-mentioned complaints mainly to the omissions of the freelancers responsible for drawing up the specifications of services.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
Suppliers and products were also specified in the tender for the construction of several university buildings.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the specifications.
As performance units, it merely indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were changed four times during the period August to September 2009 as part of a non-open procedure,
As the range of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings included inaccurate location information, inadequate structural preliminary examinations and incomplete design drawings, requiring additional services to be contracted.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not include product quality requirements.
As a result of this lack of specifications, some sub-contractors built up overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of works into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were allocated in a way, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible, with a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, in the case of six different buildings, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved in the event of a voluntary award.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be dismissed, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total award.
In the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority submitted very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders, in an open procedure, to prove, among other things, at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth 28 million euros from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public award of another part of a motorway included six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as a qualifying criterion for the companies.
Two-thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were contracted by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one bidder made an offer.
The NKÚ pointed out that a narrowing of the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the legal procedures for the award of additional services in two cases, nor did it enter into any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, the first case yielded up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several higher education buildings, some benefits were not included in the award documents, although the need for them was already known when awarding the contract.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value set by national public procurement law, the contracting authority negotiated with the contracted companies without making a contract announcement.
In the case of the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in a negotiated procedure without a call for tender.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the works by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a sample test of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Buildings.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for a sufficient degree of certainty in the performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and draw up their bids in an appropriate manner,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed at a later date and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria in the non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for the description of services have been largely met in both countries.
In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations that may have led to restrictions on competition.
The requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots may result in restrictions of the field of suppliers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that smaller and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other collusion.
When awarding and remunerating additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.
According to the EU requirements and the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded without a public procurement procedure under certain conditions.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded without notice to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
As the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently defined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional benefits must be advertised with public notice.
By splitting services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the method of awarding and taking into account the EU threshold value
By determining the type of award, the client determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential applicants and bidders largely unfettered, for example, through the choice of an open procedure, or limit it by imposing non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European rules on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction work of a project is at or above the current EU threshold of 5,000,000 euros, the construction work is generally to be awarded Europe-wide according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may derogate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and award works in national procurement contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without a compelling reason, or deliberately valued at too low a cost, in order to remove the obligation to award construction services on an Europe-wide basis.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award plays a major role in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award as well as the examination of the application of the EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Diverging rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the basic equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without having to justify or justify the decision. Other procedures, however, are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or, in the case of national contracts, the public tender is in principle a priority. This is determined by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of award - as well as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be justified and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by fixing it on certain bidders and to make it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.
Accurately estimating the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organisations to determine the likely costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost characteristics for building categories, use units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected contract value of a planned project or construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few building authorities in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction authorities is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price determinations of comparable construction measures to determine the likely cost of construction services.
In most cases, the cost assessments are based on estimates of the funding body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction department.
Measures to standardise cost-assessment procedures are still in the early stages.
Within the framework of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material costs and construction and extension works, as well as other cost-related data, in order to enable cost investigations and provisions of unit prices.
In order to better control costs, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a collection of data for construction projects,
Which will serve as a benchmark when setting prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key findings of the audit BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The audited contracting authorities largely wrote out the construction works in open proceedings or in public tenders, thereby complying with the budgetary and public procurement regulations.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal building services in the construction sector were advertised either publicly or in open proceedings.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
In the selection of non-public tenders, there were sometimes no detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public tenders have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders, and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many bids were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many bids as for hands-free tenders.
The investigation also showed that bid prices for restricted tenders and open-handed tenders were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel studies by the Federal Ministry of Building and a National Audit Office confirmed the differences in economic efficiency between public and non-public tenders.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Buildings even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold value
In the case of the construction projects for which they had calculated an expected total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans in which they determined the construction works to be awarded according to EU-wide as well as the construction works to be awarded according to national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that a share of more than 80% of construction work was to be awarded across the EU.
It could not be established that the obligation to award EU-wide contracts was being circumvented by cost estimates that were too low.
However, it was partly due to incorrect calculations that the minimum percentage of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell short.
During construction, some contracting authorities improperly changed the provisions of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum percentage of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be respected.
For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide contracts was generally lower according to the accounting results than provided for under the procurement plan.
In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities breached the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more large individual lots in EU-wide procedures,
And chose national procedures instead.
NKÚ
Choice of award method
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided works into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these distributions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded in simplified procedures or even in breach of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were an inadequate tool for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on just completed construction projects, but there was evidence of a lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contractors.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than expected order values determined with the help of the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In the construction sector, the expected order values were based on the cost values estimated by the project architects or on the estimates of the investors.
The actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later on, however, eight supplements in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros and 27%, respectively.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
In the case of the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%; in the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs increased disproportionately by 139%, as the area of use had only increased by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU regulations for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold value into national law, so the respective regulations are largely in line with each other.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be considerably improved by not limiting the field of candidates by the client's manipulation-prone stipulations and by making it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, contracting authorities can award contracts through open or non-open procedures.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in cases involving previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been improperly distributed in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold value, errors had to be found in Germany, which led to a fall in the minimum share of tendered services across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected costs of construction and construction projects.
The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure, through further checks, that the requirements for the choice of the type of contract and the scope of services to be tendered across the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost investigations are created.
Pre-information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned awards in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information is intended to contain the essential information on the planned construction projects under public procurement law.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide more detailed information on the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the subject of the order, the Europe-wide standardised vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes) must be used.
Preliminary information and notices will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the client.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign applicants, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the text of the notice has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the notice may affect competition and may even encourage manipulation.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU's pre-information and notice requirements into national law.
Diverging rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of construction works that are not to be awarded Europe-wide.
Procurement procedures may start at the earliest one month after the dispatch of the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a preliminary information be dispensed with.
In Germany, no prior information is required in the non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions before restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Internet portal and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without competition, announcements of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All the planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small part of the loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as much less construction work is divided into lots.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Pre-information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all tested construction projects with construction works to be awarded throughout Europe.
However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the offer periods, although the 52-day period required between the sending of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were put out to tender only after the 12-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.
In the case of many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned distribution of construction work in lots.
Announcements
The notices of the audited bodies contained, in part, CPV codes that deviated from the information provided by the preliminary information or that did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information, for example, on the deadlines for implementation, than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
It published the notifications on its own paid-for procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the notifications to the Federal Government's free internet portal as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited administration's reports were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Announcements
In the case of the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The limit on the number of bidders was allowed under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in the case of an open procedure, the contracting authority did not specify either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to evaluate the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
The awarding authority concluded in its assessment that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst evaluations from the further procedure.
The procedure of the awarding authority was not transparent because it did not disclose information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of the announcements
In the renovation of former military premises, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with pre-information and advertising is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for pan-European procurement, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU rules and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
Unlike the public procurement procedures, the non-public procurement procedures do not allow any company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance of which companies are to be invited to submit bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow a limit on the number of candidates in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of open procedures, at least five companies are required to submit bids.
At least three companies must be invited to participate in negotiation procedures with the award notice.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the award procedure, which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example, by allowing certain companies to be given preferential treatment on an one-sided basis.
In addition, limiting competition to a few companies also favours possible collusion by the applicants.
In both cases, the procurement result can be significantly affected at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of this procedural step.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The rules governing the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should change as frequently as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting candidates.
Nor should competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The contracting authorities have to justify the selection of candidates and document the process of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Diverging rules
In Germany, at least three suitable candidates are required to submit bids in the case of restricted tenders and, in principle, several in the case of open-handed tenders.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two specific areas, it is not permitted to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction department or an agent from the contracting authority must, as a rule, amend this proposal by, for example, taking out a proposed company and/or adding a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to conclusively determine the circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching collusion between the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially, including with regard to freelancers, and must not be made accessible to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no rules for drawing up and keeping lists of candidates secret.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be asked for, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a loophole in Czech legislation on this.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts has been met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European procurement contracts for construction services in the construction sector showed that the contracting authorities asked an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids for restricted federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for hands-free tenders.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially in the case of trades with few suppliers, the contracting authorities did not always change the number of selected applicants.
They took into account, in particular, companies already known to them and, in their view, tried and tested.
The reason for this was that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies invited to compete even before the invitation to tender.
The BRH did not find an undue restriction on regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but it did find a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities mainly attributed this to the fact that, on average, the scope of services for non-public procurement is much lower and therefore, for example, longer routes are more important than for public tenders.
Multi-eyes principle and proposals freelance tigers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities mostly failed to have the proposed list of requesting companies amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by the lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often undocumented who proposed the companies invited to submit bids.
A number of samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the list of candidates and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of the lists of bidders
At a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and could, for example, allow collusion between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of candidates
In the construction of a motorway ring, bidders were not provided with information on the assessment criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not indicate how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a procedure to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was acceptable in principle at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the lists of bidders and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be invited, the German regulations restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in the case of non-public procedures can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been insufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation for improperly restricting the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings that have been highlighted.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the request for a bid, the bidding phase begins, during which the companies can draw up bids on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their bids until the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the offer phase.
These are, above all, organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The procurement documents on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their bids are, in principle, only to be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the procurement process are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the tender phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the tender documents or other questions relating to the tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer period, it is necessary to avoid contact between the assigned freelancers as well as the applicants.
Freelancers must not be allowed to become a hub of the award procedure, through which contacts can be established with anti-competitive consequences.
Offers sent by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have a technical encryption.
Diverging rules
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies to print and send the tender documents, whose employees are required to keep the tenders confidential and to fulfil the contractual obligations conscientiously.
The offers received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and sent directly, immediately and unopened to a staff member responsible for custody.
This employee may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and entry details in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not specified in the Czech Republic.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
The examinations of the offer phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building construction administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The contracting authorities of the audited construction administration sent out the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send out procurement documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the audited building management did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding of contracts in the appointment of the contact persons for questions and information.
In the service descriptions, she did not indicate employees from the contracting authority, but from the project management as contact persons, contrary to the specifications.
Some award documents even included the names of freelancers who had drawn up the performance descriptions.
In the case of requests during the supply phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of tenders
At the audited building management, all offers received were marked with entry stamps and entry notices.
In some hands-free contracts, however, the bids were received by freelancers, which contradicted the proposals to prevent corruption.
Preservation of the offers
Following their labelling, not all offers were immediately and immediately sent to the staff responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, in a construction department, the offers were placed in an open section of the post office, to which each employee had access.
Another department had hung a letterbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers thrown in there remained even overnight.
Since the slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate offers received.
NKÚ
There were no complaints on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the offer phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment will also be respected.
The rules on receipt, custody and confidentiality of the offers appear to be suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat broader than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of tenders
Opening of tenders
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders are bound by their bids until the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU regulations for the opening of tenders.
However, the national regulations on the prevention of corruption contain extensive provisions for the protection of bids and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and comprehensibility of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulations and changes in the submitted offers.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be appointed by the contracting authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when opening up the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only offers which were submitted to the head of the negotiations when the first offer was opened are permitted for opening.
Late bids may in principle no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the bid must be recorded in a protocol, including the names of the bidders and the bid prices.
The protocol must be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Diverging rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is carrying out the opening of tenders.
Freelancers can also play a part in this.
The committee can also be tasked with further stages of the award procedure, such as valuing the bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary open the offer.
The head of the negotiations must be an official of the vacancy.
The head of the negotiations and, in the case of construction contracts, the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the award and contract execution.
According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date include not only the offer prices, but also details of discounts and special features, such as damaged or delayed offers.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Czech regulations do not exist.
In the case of an award procedure in the Czech Republic, if only an offer is received, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it must be opened and then evaluated.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Multi-eye principle
The audited contracting authorities implemented the provisions of the MehrAugen principle at the opening dates.
They each held the opening dates with negotiators and letter-writers, who were not charged with any other award acts.
In the case of hands-free contracts, however, there have been isolated cases in which freelancers have opened tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of tenders
The awarding bodies examined during the cross-sectional examination marked the bids according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
In the case of long-standing audits of some grant recipients, inadequate markings had been found.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practices following the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the offer period. However, the contracting authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries regarding the opening of the bids are in agreement in relevant parts. They take into account both the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency. Thus, the risks of corruption and manipulation can be significantly limited in the opening of the bids.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the process as well as for the identification, safe custody and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict the possibilities of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those responsible for opening the tenders are not allowed to carry out any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The few complaints in total demonstrate the high level of acceptance of the requirements for opening up the offer.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
He has to determine the offer for the award of the contract, which is best suited to the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU's requirements provide for a multi-step process:
First of all, there is the suitability of the bidders.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that have been convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The bids of the non-excluded bidders must be examined in arithmetical, technical and economic terms and assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined in particular by the client.
The examination and evaluation of the tenders is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders can be unfairly excluded or bids that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvantaging bidders, the result of the valuation can be impermissibly impaired and thus the establishment of the economically most advantageous tender can be prevented.
The contracting authority therefore has to take special precautions to ensure that the persons in charge of the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries must be examined and evaluated in a multi-stage process.
The requirements for the certificates of suitability of the companies to be submitted, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the announcements or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After the examination of the bidder's suitability, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted bids must first be formally examined as soon as possible in order to determine whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, anomalies that could indicate possible intentions of manipulation.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their bids, they must be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the bids results in a price that appears to be unreasonably low, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his bid.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Diverging rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly responsible for the processing.
The review of the bids and the calculation of the bids may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It only has to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.
If freelancers are tasked with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They can only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with proposals for awarding contracts.
At the end of the day, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of bids in Germany are only incompletely submitted, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers are to be examined.
If, on the basis of the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer shall be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their bid, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Bids with unreasonably high or low prices may not be subject to a surcharge in Germany.
If one or more bids fall short of the relevant price determination of the client or the bid amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders have to prove the correct calculation of their bids.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the bids in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the cost-effectiveness test, if only tenders with unfathomable low prices are available.
Contrary to German public procurement law, for this reason, the contract cannot be refused in the case of bids with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation.
If there are suspicions of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its specialist supervisory authority at the leading level.
It has to decide on the measures to be taken and whether to inform the anti-trust authority or the public prosecutor.
The leading level of specialist supervision, for example, must also agree to more than 50,000 euros for construction services, if a contract is to be awarded by hand, if a contract is not awarded to the offer with the lowest price, or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the audited procurement procedures were in line with the requirements listed.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient contracted companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority took into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used non-approved persons to examine the tenders.
For example, freelancers or employees involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that were only performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this by insufficient staff capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers responsible for the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to fulfil the contractual obligations conscientiously.
For the construction services, it was mostly not possible to understand whether the offers for the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Review and arithmetical examination of the offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open tenders to freelancers for further examination, without having first carried out the prescribed review of the tenders and the computational examination itself and docu-mented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the bids without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In some cases, anomalies or a lack of price or product information were not or only insufficiently marked in the documents examined.
Performance audit
In a sample in a building management department, the cheapest offers in three-quarters of the audited procurement procedures were more than 10% different from the estimated costs previously determined.
One in 20 procurement procedures has been cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.
Not all bid tests and reconnaissance talks with the bidders were traceable or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed information was lacking, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.
Often, the deviations were only justified on a flat-rate basis, e.g., by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
Construction services said it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.
In a call for tenders by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the estimated value of these services previously determined.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a briefing, the contracting authority did not find any evidence of price dumping by the company then commissioned.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value was inflated or the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "cheap company" that could not keep quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction department awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
She did not rescind the call for tenders, citing the non-material justification that this company could be closed to a reasonable calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
In the case of an audited construction administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the specialist supervisor.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant objections.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, including higher education, road construction and the extension of the railway network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the predetermined assessment criteria in the examination and evaluation of the tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the contracting authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the shortening offered was insufficiently taken into account by the second and third-place bidders.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three procurement procedures in the context of housing subsidies, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it had selected the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller contracts up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys at prices and delivery terms.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the interviews were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of the offers in both countries correspond to the requirements of the EU.
However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ from one another.
In Germany, the process is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the offered prices has to be examined.
In both countries, in some of the procurement procedures examined, it had to be established that substantial procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the tenders were not, or were insufficiently, documented.
Without comprehensibility and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If public authorities allow tasks to be performed in the examination and evaluation of bids by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the appropriateness of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the set of instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints were raised in particular with regard to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After the examination and values of the tenders, the award procedure is completed by the award of the contract or by the cancellation of the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
The companies have the possibility to examine the intended award for information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or for other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the contracting authority to observe public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
In order to do this, he has to document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and review procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall place the order within the announced contract period,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound to their bids after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may in principle not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The unsuccessful bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking their bids into account.
Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g., if bid prices are inflated or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Diverging rules
In the Czech Republic, the 10- or 15-day information and waiting period before the award of the contract also applies to construction works that are not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of the other procedures in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, an award procedure has to be cancelled if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valid offer, provided that it meets the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies received letters of contract for EU-wide contracts before the end of the information period, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In individual cases, letters of order also contained content that deviates from the content of the offer, such as changed dates, according to open procedures.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the award deadlines.
In the case of an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract on the second most favourable offer, since a company with a 50% more favourable offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the contract period had expired.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
For some contracts, such as road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the legal deadline.
In the award of construction services for the rehabilitation of former military sites, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements for the conclusion of the award procedure.
The legal protection of under-applicants or bidders increases the toolbox of corruption prevention.
In Czech public procurement law, the scope of legal protection is also extended to contracts below EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, the building authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified when completing their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the justifications of the individual decisions.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
Documentation that has been carefully and promptly drawn up will only make it possible to trace the award decisions.
It also serves, in particular, to provide effective legal protection for bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the obligation to justify procurement decisions in detail significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
The announcement of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be submitted by the contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office will publish the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, thus also implementing the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission draws up an annual EU statistics, through which it can gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU requirements on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Diverging rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publishing obligation only for restricted tenders and for hands-free contracts with a value limit of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without sales tax (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competitive process receive information on the award of contracts.
Key findings of the audit
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In the case of a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not include mandatory evidence to be provided.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Contract award notices
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publicise the award of the contracts.
In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had made the contracts awarded known.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical tables inspected contained the required minimum information. They were drawn up and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a building management company did not publish this data due to a transmission error.
The building authorities only noticed this error after half a year,
So that the contract data of the procurement procedures completed by then have not been published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly due to inaccurate information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the rating commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the opening of bids were not signed.
Contract award notices
For several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were only published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are broadly consistent in both countries and implement EU requirements.
The transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the notices substantially limited the preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The construction authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two key areas, which in the Czech Republic and Germany are essential for the award of works by public authorities: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow for cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to prevent economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of the procurement regulations in both countries, as well as the comparison of these regulations, indicate similarities and differences that may be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU's requirements for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of construction services and the consideration of the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of the procurement procedures.
The building authorities of both countries have, in some cases, subjected these bids to a great deal of additional administrative requirements.
The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transferred the requirements for the construction works to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally adjustable procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the courts of auditors have shown that the construction authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building authorities in Germany should further improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the objections raised when implementing the EU requirements.
The tests in the Czech Republic have shown, above all, risks that affect the profitability of the awards.
Incomplete descriptions of services required additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation, and cost assessments were often inadequate, and excessive skill requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially in transport buildings.
Corruption prevention
The investigations have not been aimed at uncovering cases of corruption,
It is also because the courts of auditors do not have the necessary instruments to do this.
The courts of auditors can, however, examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
When it comes to preventing corruption, the two countries have set different priorities.
The German regulations provide, above all, for a largely unrestricted competition, as well as transparency and controls, as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations set out very precisely how the bids to prevent corruption should be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the view of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures, are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for any fundamental change to the corresponding requirements of the administration in the award of construction services.
The rules on corruption prevention are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have revealed shortcomings in the implementation of some of the benchmarks.
The building authorities should further train their employees on the requirements for the prevention of corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, manipulation and corruption-prone tasks should only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against undue interference.
NKÚ
The Czech Republic has adopted an anti-corruption strategy at government level, in which public procurement is the most important element.
The Law on Public Procurement and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The tests of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the cost-effectiveness of the contract awards, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and must properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU requirements.
Widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's bids for competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideological potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the building authorities in their countries as being required to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to be able to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a positive effect on bid prices, provided that it achieves greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient awarding of contracts by public authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised construction authorities. In the Czech Republic, however, these tasks - with the exception of transport construction projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The courts of auditors of both countries have the intention, even after the completion of their joint project, to develop the relevant findings for them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both courts of auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
