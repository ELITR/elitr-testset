Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report by the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NK) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by public authorities is of great importance for the state as well as for the economy.
The state has the task of using public funds as economically and economically as possible, as well as ensuring fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by public authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.
In order to be able to ensure a largely unrestricted competition across borders, the contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements for their contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
For this purpose, the EU member states have to transfer and apply the EU's public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
It is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts below the EU threshold.
In addition, the award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the fundamentally high potential for damages, the contracting authorities therefore have to implement appropriate measures to prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits in the award of their contracts and to prevent them.
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NCA) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits for the EU-wide allocation of construction services as well as for the prevention of corruption.
The tests focused on the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in the construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU threshold were also included in the considerations with regard to the prevention of corruption.
The audit results of both courts are summarised in this joint report.
The report should also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Auditing areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits, which he carried out in 2011 / 2012 in the construction services, which are responsible for the construction of roads and buildings of the Federal Government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
From 2008 to 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations of the results of the examinations, which included construction measures in road construction, railway track construction, hydroelectric construction, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
The award of public contracts by the federal government is mainly carried out in Germany by the building services of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the state building administration is centrally responsible for public contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In the construction, the contracts are carried out in a decentralized manner by those bodies that use the state budget.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved in parts of the tendering procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in the procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide tendering procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions that are based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national awards, many complementary individual regulations are provided for by internal administrative provisions,
Such as the so-called "award books" of the Federal Government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in greater detail, in accordance with the law on public procurement.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal requirements, which apply to areas above and below EU thresholds.
The law on public procurement was significantly amended in 2012.
The new regulation increased transparency in the handling of public funds, allowed for greater competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the procurement procedure.
Guidelines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, EU-wide contracts are subject in particular to the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are subject to the national types of tendering (public tender, limited tender, open-ended award), which, however, largely correspond to the EU-wide types of tendering mentioned above.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of priority of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public tender procedure (for national contracts).
Any interested company can submit an offer at the open procedure and at the public tender.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
The division of an overall construction project into technical and partial ones serves this purpose above all.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above features of German public procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.
In Germany there are over 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide tendering procedures are also applicable to projects below the EU threshold.
An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in accordance with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal regulations in the Czech Republic allow contracting authorities to choose between the open and the not open procedure.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including around 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Volume of public contracts and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, public construction (15%) accounted for 45.5 billion euros, which includes, in addition to the federal construction, in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in the construction and construction of highways (without railway track construction and hydroelectric construction) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the construction and highway construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% not open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiation procedures and public contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide contracts.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion Euros in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was 7.8 billion euros, corresponding to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of tender for 2011: 65.1% open procedure, 14.3% non-public procedure, 9.5% negotiation procedure, 8.4% simplified procedure for volume of contracts, below the 2.7% threshold
The data refer to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries are directed at a significant part of public contracts, which are of great financial importance in the prevention of corruption in all contracts, and which have a prominent place in the award of contracts through the open procedure and the public tender.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NK) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries for the EU-wide allocation of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both courts compared the appropriate legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the fields of construction and road construction.
In doing so, they found essentially:
The EU directives on the award of works by public authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the two countries' public procurement regulations, which differ in part in their focus and detail, serve to prevent corruption (No. 3.2).
In both countries, a fundamental requirement of the award documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of an offer.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to advertising restrictions.
In Germany, the award documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the object of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services have to be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its tests, especially in the field of road construction, the NCA found that the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots can hamper competition and lead to a restriction on only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant increases in costs and risk price or other collusion.
According to the regulations of both countries, the contracting bodies can, under certain conditions, in principle agree with the already commissioned companies on additional or amended services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of contract were largely followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the awarding bodies can choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the priority of the open procedure for EU-wide tenders, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, is legally and budgetary.
This will allow more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price fixing between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building services awarded the construction services in principle throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used to determine the costs of public buildings, in particular in the construction sector.
Which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
Preliminary information and announcements are to be published for construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, which should strengthen the competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned contracts at an early stage.
The audited building services generally complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or a lack of controls may affect competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting bodies in both countries should switch among the companies to be required as frequently as possible when selecting the candidates.
In order to counter the threat of manipulation, there are in some cases very detailed guidelines in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations disregarded these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (point 4.4).
In both countries, during the bidding phase, in the interests of equal competition, it must be ensured that the companies interested in submitting an offer receive the same information.
To avoid anti-competitive collusion, a contact between these companies and freelancers, who were involved in the creation of the service description, must be avoided as far as possible.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited building services in Germany sometimes did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
When opening the offers, the principle of transparency and the principle of multi-eyes must be observed in both countries.
The requirements for marking, documentation, custody and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.
Tests in both countries showed few complaints (point 4.6).
In both countries, the assessment and evaluation of the offers are determined by requirements for the organisation of construction and the organisation of operations.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting bodies.
For example, awarding agencies passed on offers for inspection to third parties, without first looking through the offers and sufficiently documenting conspicuous events.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide tendering procedures, the companies taking part in the competition will be informed of the intended assignment prior to the award of the contract.
This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU tendering procedures.
Only in a few cases did the awarding authorities not respect the specified deadlines in the award of contracts or deviate from the bidders' offer in terms of content (point 4.8).
The documentation of the tendering procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited building services in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide requirement for transparency was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Also, some of the shortcomings identified diminished the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (point 4.9).
Foundations of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the award coordination and appeal directives, which were to be transposed into national law by the eight Member States.
The general award principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the requirement of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the award coordination directive contains specific regulations for building services to be awarded across the EU for construction projects.
In order to do this, their prospective orders must reach or exceed the current sum of 5,000,000 euros.
The regulations concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the adherence to deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of the bids, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of the candidates and the appeal directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the case of possible violations of public procurement law, affected companies can have the decisions of public contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
There is no legal definition of corruption in either country.
Generally, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
Which is usually caused by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hamper competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of the world's economic output.
For the European Union, the cost is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public contracting companies, restrictive agreements or unfair practices can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the basic tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they will have to check the structure and organisation of their administrations for areas that are particularly susceptible to corruption, in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corrupt area of work.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has adopted a guideline and recommendations on the prevention of corruption 12 in the federal administration, according to which, in addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be observed for the award area: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, the principle of transparency and transparency, the basic separation of planning, awarding and settlement, the proper and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
In 2011, for example, the responsible Federal Ministry of Public Procurement introduced an electronic control system in the area of the federal highways,
The award data - such as the estimated costs and the amount of the order - as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, are the most important principles for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a anti-corruption strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions 14.
The new legislation contains essentially the following rules: Reduction of the threshold for smaller contracts, obligation to make the tenders known to the tendering authority in advance, including the reasons for the tender, prohibition of the restriction of the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus the abolition of the possibility of bidding by means of lots, introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results of the various phases of the award procedure
Tender documents
Award Documents The award documents must contain all the information that bidders need to make a proper bid.
In particular, the award documents must enable a valid calculation.
The bidders must not be given risks that are not calculable for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the description of services and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualifications (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that determine the selection of the most economical bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for the award documents are specifically addressed to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.
The performance description must be product neutral in principle.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the production of the offers and for manipulations in their valuation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Similar or similar regulations In both countries, EU regulations on technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are product-neutral without tendering factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must normally be subdivided into performance units with specific quantity specifications.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise figures and must not include services where it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation by lump sum or time is to be avoided if possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified requirements in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to make their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The tender will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Divergent regulations
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be supervised, the public contracting authorities can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are to be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and / or by type or specialism (non-skilled).
The aim is to enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make it more difficult to agree on prices.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical in general.
Evaluation criteria in the Czech Republic must be specified in the award documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
This will allow applicants to be fully and conclusively aware of the criteria under which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the specification of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in EU-wide tendering procedures.
In the case of national tendering procedures, the evaluation criteria should only be recorded in an internal administrative notice.
Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, must not contain any information on these offices or on the planners or experts involved in building construction or road construction in Germany.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other illegal competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client about the contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send tendering documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The company's contact person is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or amended services, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (amendments), are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award additional sums to the company that has already been commissioned, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU guidelines and the German regulations, the compensation of supplementary benefits may not exceed half of the main mandate.
In addition, the additional services cannot be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a tighter limit of 20% applies to a corresponding award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work that is already underway.
If supplementary payments are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
In determining the compensation for the additional services, it is to be assumed that the agreed prices and the basis of the price calculation of the order already issued are the basis.
In addition to supplementary benefits, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, it is not possible to charge smaller amounts with additional supplementary payments.
Essential exam results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the service descriptions included references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also contained product-specific specifications - for example, for graffiti protection, tapes or noise protection panels - without the need for this.
In some cases, performance requirements were described in such detail that only one product was eligible.
Lists of services subdivided according to partial performance
The BRH has not found any infringement of the bid in any of the examined proceedings to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial performances.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the tender documents were completed before the beginning of the tenders.
In some procedures, the tender documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the power registers contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
Almost half of the service list for demolition work consisted of such requirements.
Loose and score criteria
For many contracts, there was a lack of the prescribed reason why the benefits, which were mainly advertised to the unskilled, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were in part on the cover pages or in attached plans or expert opinions.
In one case, the awarding authority even expressly asked the applicants to contact the architect "regarding the questions of the tender."
In the construction sector in particular, the awarding bodies attributed the complaints identified mainly to the failings of the freelancers charged with drawing up the service descriptions.
The building services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to sufficiently control the performance descriptions.
NK
Technical specifications and non-product tendering In the public contract for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying it.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with power units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the service descriptions.
As a power unit, it simply gave the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were amended four times in the period August to September 2009, under a non-open procedure,
Since the scope of services has increased significantly and the technical requirements have changed.
Tender documents for social buildings included inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary structural studies and incomplete construction drawings, requiring additional services to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not contain any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors built over-priced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Loose and qualifying criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial or partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that, if selected parts were allocated on the spot, savings of up to €31.6 million would have been possible, with a total cost of €620.3 million.
For example, in the case of six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved if they had been awarded on the spot.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded on the spot, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared with a total allocation.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority set very extensive reference requirements as criteria for suitability.
During the construction of part of a motorway, the tendering authority required bidders in an open procedure to prove, among other things, that at least three road construction projects had been carried out, each worth 28 million euros over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine operators met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least 480 million euros in the last three years as a criterion for the suitability of the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion Euros out of a total of 3.7 billion Euros) were allocated by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 tendering procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two bidders, or even only one bidder, made an offer.
The NICU showed that a reduction in the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures required by law when awarding additional services, nor did it conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, amendments were made in the first case of up to 63.7 million Euro (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million Euro (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the award was made.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the 20% of the original contract value set by the national public procurement law, the tendering authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without announcing the contract.
In the case of the construction of a large courthouse, the tendering authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiations without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by EUR 2 million.
The unit prices for the additional construction work awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further findings
Based on a sampling of construction projects, the NK found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Building, the average cost of a four-lane motorway is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that highway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic regulations on the award documents are broadly in agreement in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the service descriptions should enable bidders to properly calculate and create their offers,
Protect the client from additional services to be subsequently agreed and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations that further reduce competition restrictions and opportunities for manipulation.
In the Czech Republic there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by the publication of the evaluation criteria in non-EU tendering procedures.
The requirements for the performance description have been largely complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, there have been objections, which may have led to restrictions on competition.
The imperative for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NCO, the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots can lead to restrictions of the provider field on only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements in road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow range of operators and small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to take part in the competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other collusion.
In the case of the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
According to the EU guidelines and the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a public notice procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there is a tighter limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
Since the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess exceeds 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse effects can be avoided.
Setting the type of contract and taking into account the EU threshold
By specifying the type of contract, the client determines the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example, by choosing an open procedure or by imposing non-public tendering procedures.
For construction projects that meet or exceed a threshold set by the EU, Europe-wide tendering procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of contract, the contracting authority has to take into account, in particular, European bids for competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 Euros, construction services are to be awarded in principle throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the principle of Europe-wide contracting in construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold and award construction services in national contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without any compelling reason or consciously valued at too low cost values, in order to deprive it of the obligation to award construction services across Europe in principle.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the method of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed reasoning of the chosen award method as well as the examination of the obligation to apply the EU procurement regulations are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements on tendering procedures and the threshold into national law.
Divergent regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the not open procedure, without the decision being documented or substantiated, whereas other procedures are only possible according to certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure, or - in the case of national contracts - the public tender procedure, which is determined by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the guidelines for the prevention of corruption, has priority.
Other types of tenders - such as the non-open procedure or the limited tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by setting certain bidders and to make it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The principle of public tendering is a central element in preventing corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
The construction authorities in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. Among other things, the databases contain cost specifications for building categories, use units, building elements or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected order value of a planned plan or a construction output to be awarded can be determined.
In Germany, only a few building services have corresponding cost databases for road construction.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting agencies in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price estimates of comparable construction measures to determine the likely cost of construction services.
In most cases, the cost assessment is based on estimates by the financing authority or results from the amount of funds made available to the building services.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the competent ministries were given the task of creating a database of standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material costs and on construction and construction works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable the calculation of costs and the determination of unit prices.
For better cost control, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects,
Which is to be used as a benchmark in price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Essential test results BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The audited contracting bodies largely wrote out the construction services in an open procedure or in public tender and thus complied with budgetary and public procurement regulations.
In 2011, 59.5% of the building services of the federal government were advertised in public or open procedures.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
In the choice of non-public tenders, there was a partial lack of substantiation as to why the awarding bodies had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional investigation, based on more than 16,000 tendering procedures, the BRH found that non-public tendering methods have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders, and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many bids were submitted in public tenders as in limited tenders and almost three times as many bids as in open-ended tenders.
The study also showed that the average bid price for limited tenders and freehold contracts was 6% and 10% higher, respectively, than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Building and the National Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public contracts.
As a result of its investigations into economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Building even found twice as many differences between public and non-public tendering procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of the construction projects, for which they had determined a probable total order sum of more than 5,000,000 Euros, the inspected contracting bodies usually set out plans in which the construction services to be awarded according to EU and national tendering procedures were determined.
According to the award plans, a share of more than 80% of the construction work was to be awarded throughout the EU.
It was not possible to determine how to avoid the obligation to award EU-wide contracts by means of cost estimates that were too low.
However, it was partly due to erroneous calculations that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering procedures fell below the actual figure.
During construction, some contracting agencies improperly altered the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum level of EU-wide tendering procedures was still being observed.
For most of the audited construction measures, the share of EU-wide contracts according to the settlement results was usually lower than planned under the award plan.
In some cases, the contracting bodies breached the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more in comprehensive individual cases in EU-wide proceedings for projects above the EU threshold.
And chose national procedures instead.
NK
Choice of type of contract
For several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sports event and housing projects, the contracting bodies divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
Due to these divisions, the individual services were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In the field of road construction, the price databases available for this area were only an insufficient instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on recently completed construction projects, where there were, however, indications of a lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional expenditure on services or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the probable order values determined by means of the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price growth indices in the construction sector.
In the construction, the prospective contract values were based on estimates of costs estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.
The actual order values differed sharply from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later, but eight additions in the course of construction resulted in an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros and 27% respectively.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimate price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
In the case of the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately by 139%, since the usable space had expanded by only 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU regulations on the definition of the type of contract and on taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
In comparison with non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the competition in public procedures or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of bids and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is greatly improved by the fact that the applicant field is not limited by manipulative requirements of the client and that price agreements between the bidders are made more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.
According to Czech legislation, contracting authorities can award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
Following the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings with previous competition.
Thus, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the awarding bodies have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been unlawfully distributed in order to avoid the requirements for the selection of the award method.
When considering the EU threshold, errors had to be detected in Germany, which resulted in a fall below the minimum proportion of benefits advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution for determining the probable costs of construction services and construction projects.
The building services should ensure, if necessary, through further controls, that the requirements for the selection of the type of contract and the scope of services to be advertised throughout Europe are complied with, or that the conditions for determining the true costs are created.
Advance Information and Notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential information on the planned construction projects in accordance with public procurement law.
They are required for construction projects where the estimated total contract value exceeds or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In notices, the client must provide details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Among other things, it has to make known the scope of services, the procedure and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the subject of the order, the common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes) should be used in a uniform manner throughout Europe.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the client.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at the national level must not contain additional information and must only be issued to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union once the notice has been sent.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may adversely affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for pre-information and publicity into national law.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements are also to be published for construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Tendering procedures may not begin until one month after the sending of the pre-information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of pre-information be avoided.
In Germany, the non-EU tendering procedures do not require advance information.
In the national tendering procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions must be published on the Internet portal of the Federal Government and, if necessary, in newspapers or journals.
For restricted tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are required (ex ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is particularly important because of the small size of the construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of the scheme is limited, as much less construction work is divided into lots.
Essential exam results
BRH
Preliminary information
The surveyed contracting bodies published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they reduced the offer period, although the 52-day period required between the dispatches of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the 12-month period of validity of the pre-information had already expired and before it had been extended.
In the case of many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcements
The announcements of the audited bodies contained some CPV codes, which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not cover the required services in an appropriate manner.
In individual cases, announcements at national level were published earlier or contained more information - such as implementation deadlines - than announcements in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex ante transparency
The contracting bodies of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national tendering procedures.
The company published the notices on its own chargeable contracting platform.
However, the contracting bodies did not check whether the company had forwarded the messages to the federal government's free internet portal as required.
Spot checks showed that only a third of the reports of the audited administration were published on this portal.
NK
Announcements
During the construction of a wastewater treatment plant, the awarding authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The awarding authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, in a non-open procedure, the awarding authority did not specify in the announcement or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it would evaluate the qualifications of the candidates and how many candidates it wanted to admit to the competition.
The award body came to the conclusion in its assessment that all six candidates complied with the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the awarding authority was not transparent because it did not disclose any information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at the time of the procedure.
Publication of announcements
During the refurbishment of the former military site, the tender office did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with pre-information and publicity is an important element in order to implement the transparency requirement for Europe-wide awards, strengthen competition and thus also prevent corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
In contrast to the public procurement procedures, in the non-public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public tendering procedures, the awarding authority must make a preliminary selection of which companies are to be invited to submit bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow a limitation of the number of candidates in the EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are required to submit bids.
At least three companies are to be invited to negotiate with tenders.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently high to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed beforehand.
The selection of companies to be required is a process within the tendering procedure, which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example by giving preference to certain companies.
In addition, limiting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.
In both cases, the result can be significantly affected at the expense of the client.
The awarding bodies must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding bodies should switch among the companies to be required as frequently as possible when selecting the candidates.
Nor must competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The awarding bodies have to justify the selection of the candidates and document the process of the selection procedure in their award notices.
Divergent regulations
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three and in the case of open-ended contracts, several suitable candidates are to be invited to submit bids.
According to the new Czech regulations, apart from two special areas, it is illegal to restrict the number of bidders for non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public tendering procedure, the management level of the construction agency or a contractor from the tendering body will usually have to amend this proposal by taking out a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to determine the final circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for wide-ranging collusion between the parties.
The list of companies to be required must be kept confidential - also for freelancers - and not made generally accessible.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no regulations to establish and keep the names of candidates secret.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be charged, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a loophole in Czech legislation in this area.
Essential exam results
BRH
Number of candidates
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts has been met, except for a few exceptions.
An analysis of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European-wide tendering procedures for construction services in the construction sector showed that the contracting bodies were asking on average 6.6 for limited tenders from the federal government in Germany and 4.4 for freehold contracts on average for companies to tender.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with few suppliers, the contracting agencies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.
As a reason for this, they said they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to compete in non-public proceedings even before they were invited to submit an offer.
The BRH did not establish an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public tendering procedures, but rather a higher proportion of regional companies than in public tenders.
The award authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower on average and therefore, for example, longer routes are more important than in public tenders.
More-Eye Principle and Proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the regulations, the contracting bodies have largely omitted to have the proposed list of companies to be modified by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by the lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was often not documented who had proposed the companies required to submit offers.
From some samples it emerged that freelancers had drawn up the candidate lists and these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the awarding bodies.
Thus, the awarding bodies did not protect themselves against possible manipulations to the extent required.
Confidential treatment of bidders
At a contracting agency, the lists of the companies to be required were recorded in a data processing system, which could be viewed by all employees of that service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or approved companies could have been passed on unauthorized and could, for example, allow for collusion among these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures only contained justifications for the selection of candidates in a few cases.
NK
Selection of candidates
When building a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a ballot procedure to select the companies.
However, this procedure, which was generally acceptable at the time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation of the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the more-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting bodies to propose the companies to be required, the German regulations restrict such abuse possibilities.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can, above all, counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulating an abusive restriction of the participant field has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficits that have been identified.
Bid phase
With the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, the tender phase begins, in which the companies can make bids on the basis of the tendering documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their bids until the tender period set by the awarding authority expires.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the tendering procedure.
The awarding bodies have to observe the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation existing during the bid phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The tender documents, on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their bids, are to be sent in principle only by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to perform this task.
The awarding authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In the event of confusion on the award documents or other questions concerning the tender procedure, only the awarding authority may provide information to the candidates.
Freelancers commissioned with the production of the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelancers must not become a hub of the tendering process, through which contacts can be established with anti-competitive consequences.
Bids sent by post or direct must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Offers sent electronically have a technical encryption.
Divergent regulations
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies to print and send the tender documents, whose employees are obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
The offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp in Germany and must be sent immediately, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.
This employee may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a reference number.
The awarding authority records the bid data, including order numbers, as well as the production and entry data in a protocol.
Custody of the offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Essential exam results
BRH
The tests for the tender phase focused mainly on the tendering procedures of a construction administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The contracting offices of the inspected building administration sent the tendering documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send out tendering documents.
Information to candidates
For the most part, the inspected building administration did not comply with the requirements for separating planning and contracting when naming the contact persons for questions and information.
Contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting authority in the service descriptions, but from the project managers as contact persons.
Some tendering documents even contained the names of freelancers who had drawn up the service descriptions.
In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information when making enquiries during the bid phase.
Labelling of offers
In the case of the approved building administration, all offers received were provided with an entrance stamp and an entrance note.
For some freelance contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the preconditions for preventing corruption.
Keeping the offers
Following their identification, not all offers immediately and immediately reached the employee responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were placed in an open section of the post office, to which every employee had access.
Another office had hung a mailbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, and some of the offers received there remained overnight.
Since the entry slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only employees, but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to remove received offers and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
NK
There were no complaints on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and professionals involved in the tendering process are to be prevented in both countries.
In addition, by providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should be respected.
The rules on the receipt, custody and confidentiality of the offers seem appropriate to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be rectified with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents read and thus made known.
From the opening date, bidders will be bound to their bids until the expiration of the award period set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no specific EU regulations for the opening up of bids.
However, the national regulations for the prevention of corruption contain extensive requirements for the protection of bids and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the tendering procedure.
The multi-eye principle and the transparency and traceability of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulation and alteration of the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The opening date must be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.
In most tendering procedures, bidders can attend the opening date.
Only offers are accepted for the opening, which were submitted to the head of the negotiations when the first bid was opened.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the bid must be set out in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the bid prices must be recorded.
The minutes are to be read and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of the bids.
Freelancers can also play a part in this.
The committee can also be tasked with other phases of the tendering process, such as the evaluation of the bids.
In Germany, a chief negotiator and a secretary are carrying out the bid opening.
The chief negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.
The head of the negotiations and, in the case of contracts in the building, also the secretary are not to be involved in the processing of the award documents, as well as in the awarding and execution of contracts.
In the minutes of the opening date, according to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information about discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or delayed offers - must be recorded.
In the Czech Republic, apart from the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent modifications and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for the processing.
Czech regulations do not exist.
If a tender procedure in the Czech Republic involves only one bid, it must not be opened and must not be sent back.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it has to be opened and then evaluated.
Essential exam results
BRH
More-eye principle
The audited awarding bodies implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They carried out the opening sessions with negotiators and writers, who were not responsible for any other awards.
However, in the case of freehold awards of a smaller scope, there have been occasional cases in which freelancers have opened offers sent to them without the involvement of the contracting authority.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered; in some cases, signatures were even missing.
Labelling of offers
The contracting bodies examined in the context of the cross-sectional inspection identified the offers according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
In the case of longer-term audits of some beneficiaries, insufficient markings had been identified.
However, these contracting bodies changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
NK
Offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received only one month after the expiration of the tender period at the awarding authority, which nevertheless accepted the offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries for the opening of the offers coincide in significant parts. They take into account both the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency. This means that the risks of corruption and manipulation can be substantially limited when the offers are opened up.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, the safe storage and the confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict the possibilities for manipulation, such as subsequent modifications of the offers.
In addition, those charged with the opening of the offers may not perform other tasks in connection with the performance to be awarded.
The total of only a few complaints show the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the bid.
Review and evaluation of the offers
Review and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers that are available at the opening date.
He has to determine the offer for the award of the award, which corresponds best to the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU guidelines provide for a multi-level procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be established.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that have been convicted of, for example, bribery or fraud are to be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The bids of the not excluded bidders are to be examined in terms of calculation, technology and economics and evaluated on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economical offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The review and evaluation of the bids is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders can be unjustly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in the competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the result can be unacceptably impaired and thus the establishment of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons charged with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
In accordance with the requirements of the EU, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in a multi-stage procedure.
The requirements for the proof of suitability of the companies to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are specified in the notices or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After testing the suitability of the bidding, the suitability criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The rating has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted bids must first be formally examined immediately to see if they are complete and if they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from further consideration and evaluation of their bids, they must be informed of this without delay.
If the valuation of the bids results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given an opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his bid.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Divergent regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to those directly responsible for processing them.
The review of the offers as well as the calculation of the bids may only be carried out by the awarding authority.
It has only to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated.
If freelancers are charged with checking and valuing, they must treat the offers in confidence.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be made by the awarding bodies.
In the Czech Republic, procurement committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the bids.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with proposals for awarding contracts.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the contracts awarded.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of bids in Germany are not submitted in full, the awarding authority has to give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiration of the deadline is the offer excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether to give bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do this, he must be excluded.
In Germany, apart from the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be investigated.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that the prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and if the awarding authority can prove that the prices are calculated in a mixed manner, this offer must be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their bid, which can result in significant increases in the cost of the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mix calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
In Germany, a surcharge may not be imposed on offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more bids fall short of the true price determination of the client or the bid sums of the remaining bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their bids.
If this is not possible for them, the awarding authority can exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after checking the economic efficiency, if only offers with unjustifiable at low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge for offers with prices substantially higher than those of the client cannot be refused for this reason.
If there are suspicions of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the awarding authority must immediately report to its technical supervision at the leading level.
It has to decide what measures to take and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor.
For example, the professional supervision at the leading level must also agree to construction work of more than 50,000 euros if the contract is to be awarded by hand, if the bid is not to be awarded at the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no regulations in the Czech Republic.

Suitability and rating criteria
The vast majority of tested tendering procedures complied with the requirements set out above.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting bodies did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned the company without the required proof of suitability being complete.
In some proceedings, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken into account all known award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the people involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some awarding bodies used unauthorised persons to check the offers.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting office.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers charged with examining the offers also assisted employees who were not obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was usually not clear whether the offers for freelancers were only available to those directly responsible for the work.
Inspection and computational verification of offers
Some awarding bodies passed on the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination themselves and having documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without the contracting bodies being able to understand this.
In the documents checked, some conspicuous or missing price or product information were not or only inadequately marked.
Performance audits
For a sample in a building administration, the most favourable offers in three quarters of the tested tendering procedures deviated more than 10% from the estimate costs previously determined.
Each twentieth award procedure was cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.
Not all of the bidders were able to understand or sufficiently document their bid tests and discussions with bidders.
In many cases, there is a lack of more detailed information, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
Frequently, the deviations were only justified in general terms, for example by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building authorities explained that the detection and detection of mixed calculations is difficult.
In the case of an invitation to tender from an institution under public law, the offer price of the most advantageous offer was 66% below the previously determined estimate value of these services.
Closer calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation have not been documented.
In a briefing, the awarding authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another call for tender, a building services authority awarded the bid, the price of which was 35% higher than the value of the cost assessment.
It did not cancel the call for tender, citing the non-factual reason that an adequate calculation could be concluded for this company.
Suspected irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities in the audited building administration, both of which were reported to the leading authority.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a call for tenders, so that the awarding authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the tests did not reveal any substantial complaints.
NK
Aptitude test
For many of the approved construction projects, including university construction, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the awarding bodies did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the extent required. On the other hand, a tendering body could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had complied with the requirements.
Rating
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the awarding authority omitted the given evaluation criteria when considering and valuing the bids.
In a construction project for the extension of the railway network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.
As a result, the bidders in second and third place did not take sufficient account of the shortfall offered.
Documentation of the selection
In three tendering procedures for housing development, the tendering body did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it had selected the successful bidder.
During the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority chose the companies for smaller contracts up to 20,000 Euros on the basis of telephone surveys of prices and delivery conditions alone.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for examining and evaluating the offers in both countries are in line with the requirements of the EU.
However, the details of the procedure and the selection of the people involved differ from one another.
In Germany, the procedure is more closely regulated than in the Czech Republic due to detailed requirements, in particular regarding the implementation of the multi-eye principle and the protection of the offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the offered prices must be examined.
In both countries, it had to be established in some of the tendering procedures examined that substantial steps in the examination and evaluation of the bids had not been or had been inadequately documented.
However, without accountability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the public contracting authority having sufficiently looked through and documented the offers beforehand, thus protecting them against possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If public authorities have tasks carried out during the examination and evaluation of the offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to respond to the increased risk of manipulation.
When examining the appropriateness of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not examine the price structure of the offers sufficiently.
In the Czech Republic there have been complaints, particularly regarding the suitability test and the application of the assessment criteria.
Closure of the award procedure
After examining the value of the bids, the award procedure will be completed by the award of the bid or by the suspension of the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
The companies have the possibility to check the intended allocation of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or by other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to open a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiration of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, it is only possible to conclude the contract after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure legal protection for companies and to encourage the contracting authority to observe public procurement law throughout the entire tendering procedure.
To do this, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented the EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the award.
However, it must not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a proper review and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall place the order within the announced surcharge period,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound to their bids after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may not in principle deviate from the content of the offer at the conclusion of the contract.
The underperforming bidders must be informed in a timely manner about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account.
Tendering procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, for example if the bid prices are inflated or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, the 10-day or 15-day information and waiting period prior to the award of the contract also applies to construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide awards.
In the other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure has to be cancelled if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been accepted.
In Germany, the award is only to be made in the case of a single, valuable bid, provided that it meets the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Essential exam results
BRH
There were only a few complaints in respect of the tested awards at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies awarded contracts at EU-wide contracts even before the expiration of the information periods, which may result in the contract being ineffective.
According to open procedures, contract letters also contained different content in individual cases, such as amended deadlines.
In several cases, the clients did not meet the surcharge deadlines.
In an open procedure, a tendering authority therefore awarded the contract for the second-cheapest offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to perform the services at the originally offered price after the end of the surcharge period.
NK
In the case of a construction project in the university sector, the awarding authority in the contract deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.
For some contracts, for example in the construction of road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting bodies concluded the contracts after the legal deadline.
When awarding construction work for the refurbishment of the former military site, the awarding authority only forwarded the notice of the award to all bidders after the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the requirements of the EU at the end of the tendering procedure.
The legal protection of the underperforming candidates or bidders increases the scope of the prevention of corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below EU thresholds.
In both countries, time limits for placing orders have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
The building services should in future avoid the identified shortcomings in the completion of their tendering procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting requirements
The award procedures are to be documented during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the justifications of the individual decisions.
For EU-wide procedures, the orders are to be announced.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption The documentation of the procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
Carefully and promptly produced documentation allows for the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders for contracts above EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to justify award decisions in detail significantly limits the scope for manipulation.
The announcement of a contract in an EU-wide tender procedure has to be submitted to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting bodies must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report it to the competent national ministries of the European Commission.
On this basis, the European Commission produces an annual EU statistic, which enables it to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish awarded contracts is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to the other tendering procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for limited tenders and for freehold contracts with a value limit of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex post transparency).
Under these limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies taking part in the competition procedure will receive information about the contracts awarded.
Essential exam results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the tested tendering procedures were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a tendering procedure, the awarding authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain compelling evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the awarding authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements on contracts
In some EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authorities failed to disclose the award of the contracts.
In the case of further tendering procedures, there was a lack of evidence that the contracting authorities had disclosed the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistics that were viewed contained the minimum required information. They had been drawn up and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building services published the contract data of the completed tendering procedures.
However, a construction administration failed to publish the data due to a transmission error.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
So that the contract data of the tendering procedures completed up to then were not published.
NK
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings in construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, mainly in the case of incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the bid openings were not signed.
Announcements on contracts
For several road construction projects, announcements of contracts awarded have been delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and the reporting and reporting requirements in both countries are broadly in line with each other and implement the EU guidelines.
In principle, this ensures the transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.
The regulations to be applied for publication in the Czech Republic go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The flaws identified in the documentation and in the notices significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The building services should further improve the transparency of their tendering procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel tests of the NK and the BRH have focused on two main areas, which in the Czech Republic and in Germany are essential for the award of construction services by public authorities: The application of EU procurement regulations and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only designed to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of the public procurement regulations in both countries, as well as the comparison of these regulations, provide conclusions on similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU requirements for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of construction services and the consideration of the essential bids of the competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of the tendering procedures.
The building services of both countries have in some cases very extensively supported these bids by further administrative regulations.
To a large extent, the Czech Republic has also applied the requirements of the construction contracts to its nationally regulated tendering procedures below the EU threshold.
However, investigations by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building services have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its tendering procedures in order to be able to remove the complaints identified when implementing the EU requirements.
The tests carried out in the Czech Republic have, above all, revealed dangers that affect the efficiency of the contracts.
For example, incomplete descriptions of performance required additional services, which were often awarded in violation of the law. In addition, the cost calculations were mostly inadequately prepared, and excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of possible bidders and, in particular, restricted competition in the construction of roads.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,
Also because the courts of auditors do not have appropriate instruments for this.
However, the courts can check to what extent the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities in the prevention of corruption.
The German regulations foresee, above all, a largely unrestricted competition and transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech regulations is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of prevention of corruption apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the requirements for the award of construction services and geared towards their specific requirements.
According to the regulations, it is sometimes very clear how the bids for the prevention of corruption are to be taken into account in the course of the tendering procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRF, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction services, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative interventions.
Risk analysis and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of the award procedures, as well as various organisational measures, are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for change in principle to the corresponding requirements of the administration when awarding construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have shown shortcomings in the implementation of some requirements.
The building services should continue to train their employees on the requirements for the prevention of corruption and make them even more sensitive to this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks the building services had delegated to freelancers.
However, without checks and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Manipulative and corrupt tasks should therefore only be assigned to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.
NK
At the level of government, the Czech Republic has adopted a strategy against corruption, in which the most important element is the area of public procurement.
The award law and the related implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The tests of the NK took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, since the awarding bodies must justify the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the type of assessments, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NK and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU guidelines.
The broad acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the building services in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of tendering procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks, in order to identify the need for action and to be able to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction services into lots can have a favourable effect on supply prices, provided that greater competition is achieved with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct execution of the tendering procedures is an essential basis for efficient contracting of public contracts.
In Germany, the tendering procedures are carried out by the building services specialized in this field, whereas in the Czech Republic, these tasks are carried out - with the exception of the transport projects - by the departments themselves or by the contractors commissioned by them.
After the completion of their joint project, the two countries' courts of auditors will continue to develop the knowledge that is important to them and, if necessary, refer it to the parliament and the government of their country.
In addition, both courts are convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and knowledge set out are of general importance in order to combat corruption effectively and to ensure the economic allocation of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
