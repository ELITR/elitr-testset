Public procurement of construction works and prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The awarding of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both to the State and to the economy.
The state has the task of using the public funds as economically and economically as possible and ensuring fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure a largely unlimited competition, even cross-border, contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements when granting contracts above certain thresholds.
To this end, the EU member states have to transpose the EU public procurement law into national law and apply it.
This has already happened both in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Below EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate public procurement themselves.
The award of services is also a corruption-prone area.
Because of the generally high level of damage potential, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue preferential treatment when awarding their contracts.
The Supreme Control Agency of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to conduct parallel audits both for the EU-wide awarding of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.
The focus of the audits was the application of the EU procurement law, which had been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction works in building construction and in road construction or transport infrastructure.
Subcontracting below EU thresholds was also included in the analysis for corruption prevention purposes.
The audit results of both SAIs are summarized in this Joint Report.
The report should also be sent to international institutions, such as To the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Examination areas and audited bodies The Federal Court of Auditors' evaluations of the listed topics are predominantly based on cross-sectional audits carried out in 2011/2012 by the building authorities responsible for road construction and building construction in Germany.
He tested z. As the construction of highways and large building projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Audit used results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction work in road construction, railway construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
The public procurement of the federal government in Germany is predominantly carried out by the building administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for the awarding of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, awards are made decentrally by those who use state resources.
In both countries, self-employed persons are also involved in sub-sectors of the procurement procedure.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and in the market structure for construction work of both countries must be taken into account.
Structure of the procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Contracting procedures limited to the national area are governed by the budgetary law and the administrative provisions based thereon.
For both EU-wide and national awards, many complementary individual rules are set by administrative rules,
such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the Federal Government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in compliance with procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and the other legal provisions applicable both to the range above and below the EU thresholds.
Public procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new regulation increased transparency in the use of public funds, facilitated increased competition and limited opportunities for corruption in the award procedure.
Principles of procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be applied in the case of EU-wide awards.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold apply the national contracting procedures (public tender, restricted tender, free-for-sale), which, however, largely correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide awarding procedures.
The public procurement law in Germany is characterized by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (assignments to be carried out throughout the EU) and the public invitation to tender (by national awards).
Any interested company may submit an offer in the open procedure and in the public invitation to tender.
Another key feature of German procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.
Above all, the division of a total construction measure into specialized and partial lots serves this purpose.
The individual awarding of these lots should enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above features of German procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
In Germany, more than 330,000 construction companies employ 1.9 million people.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure, where below the thresholds and under certain conditions a less stringent procedure may be applied.
The Czech public procurement law contains provisions, in accordance with EU law, that contracts should be concluded when competition is ensured and a favorable price is achieved.
The current legislation in the Czech Republic allows contracting entities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and share of contracting in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros was accounted for by public construction (15%), to which, apart from federal construction, especially the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities count.
The construction volume of the Federal Government in building construction and highway construction (excluding railway construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of works contracts for building construction and highway construction of the federal government was divided among the contracting types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders and 6.6% negotiated procedures and Freehand awards.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic in 2011 amounted to € 4.7 billion, representing about 25% of the total volume of construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to € 7.8 billion, which corresponds to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by award type for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and works contracts awarded in 2011 by public contracting entities.
The above data shows that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant part of public procurement, that the importance of preventing corruption in all public procurement transactions has a high financial impact, and that the open procedure and the public tenders are of prime importance when awarding contracts
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel tests in their countries for the EU-wide awarding of construction works and for preventing corruption.
The working groups of both SAIs compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, in particular in the fields of building construction and road construction.
In essence, they stated:
The EU directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also governed by the procurement regulations of both countries, which differ in some aspects in their focus and detail (Section 3.2).
In both countries, a key requirement of the tender documents is that they must contain all the information needed for proper tendering.
The specifications must be neutral and must not be restrictive to competition.
In Germany, the tender documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it continues to be a problem to sufficiently define the subject of the contract.
In Germany, construction work should be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
In its inspections, especially in the field of road construction, the NKÚ stated that the awarding of extensive services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Constraints on market potential can result in significant cost increases and involve the risk of price or other collusion.
Under the terms of both countries, contracting entities may, under certain conditions, in principle, agree additional or changed services with the contracting companies which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (point 4.1).
The respective specifications for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting entities may freely choose between open and restricted procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide awards and the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national awards, applies.
This allows more companies to submit offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price fixing between bidders difficult and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction authorities generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used for costing public buildings, especially in building construction,
which are based on the evaluations completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).
In the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe, prior information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to prepare for the planned awards at an early stage.
The audited building authorities usually followed this requirement.
In some cases, misstatements, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (point 4.3).
The selection of applicants for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to tampering.
Under EU law, the number of invited candidates must be high enough to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, not discriminate and be announced in advance.
In addition to EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries are to switch as often as possible among applicants in the selection of candidates.
In order to counteract the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.
The audited administrations did not take into account these requirements in some cases.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (paragraph 4.4).
In both countries, in the bidding phase, in order to ensure fair competition, it is important to ensure that companies interested in receiving tenders receive the same information.
Contact between these companies with each other and with freelancers involved in drawing up the terms of reference must be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited building authorities in Germany partially did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
When opening up tenders, in both countries particular attention must be paid to the MehrAugen principle and the principle of transparency.
The requirements for labeling, documentation, custody and confidentiality of the offers should restrict the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.
The tests in both countries showed few complaints (No 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by specifications for the structure and process organization.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but were not consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
Contracting authorities, for example, handed over quotes to third parties for examination without having to go through the offers beforehand and adequately document irregularities.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
When concluding the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed about the intended contract prior to the award of the contract.
This legal protection option also has a preventive function against corrupt behavior.
The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did contracting authorities not comply with the deadlines set by the contract or did they deviate from the bidders' offer (point 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited building authorities in both countries.
The EU-wide transparency requirement was not adequately implemented in the award notes of some of the proceedings.
Also, some of the identified deficiencies mitigated the corruption prevention function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely fulfilled their reporting and reporting obligations (point 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union for the free movement of goods and services, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted inter alia the Procurement Coordination and Remedies Directives, which were to be transposed by the Member States into national law.
The general principles of the award of the European Union are, in particular, the requirement of competition, the requirement of equal treatment or non-discrimination, and the requirement of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive lays down specific rules for works contracts to be awarded throughout the EU for construction projects.
For this purpose, their prospective order totals must reach or exceed a current level of 5,000,000 euros.
In particular, the rules concern the content of the tender documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of time limits, including the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of the candidates and The Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, the companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed by means of review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
corruption prevention
Importance of corruption prevention
In both countries there is no legal definition of the term corruption.
In general, corruption is understood as the misuse of a trust to a private advantage,
usually caused by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause considerable economic damage.
It is estimated that the worldwide cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the scale of these costs is estimated at 1%.
For contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question trust in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.
In doing so, they have to check the organizational structure and procedures of their administrations for areas that are particularly susceptible to corruption in order to take appropriate precautionary measures against corruption.
Preventive action and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making to corruption.
The award of public works is generally considered to be a particularly vulnerable area of corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery as well as acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under penal and employment law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration. Accordingly, the following principles must be observed in addition to the risk analysis for the awarding area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multiple eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and billing, precise and complete documentation of the award procedures.
In addition, other anti-corruption provisions have been included in the procurement regulations.
For example, in 2011 the responsible Federal Ministry for Contracts for Federal Highway Systems introduced an electronically-based control system,
with the award data - such. For example, the estimated costs and the contract sums - as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected across the board and analyzed for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labor law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers as well as the prohibition of any discrimination are the most important bases of corruption prevention.
For public procurement, the Czech Government has set out anti-corruption measures in an anti-corruption strategy paper for 2011-2012 and updated them for 2013-2014.
Some of the measures recommended therein have already been transposed into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions14.
The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions: reduction of thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to prior notice of contract awards by the contracting authority, including the grounds for invitations to tender, prohibition of restricting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus abolishing bidder selection options Lottery procedure, introduction of the obligation to publish the procurement documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the individual phases of the award procedure
Vergabeunterlagen
Tender documents The tender documents must contain all the information that the tenderers need for a proper tender.
In particular, the tender documents must enable an accurate calculation.
In doing so, the bidders must not be assigned any risks that can not be calculated on their part.
The tender documents consist in particular of the terms of reference and the terms of contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that determine the selection of the most economical bid.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law for the tender documents are in particular related to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and are intended to restrict competition as little as possible.
The service description must always be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the specification is only permitted under strict conditions.
The avoidance of restrictive rules in the tender documents is also an elementary principle of corruption prevention.
In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the tender documents should be avoided, since they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of tenders and manipulation in their valuation.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules In both countries, the EU legal requirements for technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
The services are basically product-neutral without requiring specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services usually have to be subdivided in detail into service units with respective quantities.
Here, prices are to be agreed on the basis of service units (eg Euro per m² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may services be defined by functional targets.
The specifications must in any case be complete and clear.
They must contain exact quantities and must not include services for which it is not certain that they will be needed.
Remunerations after lump sums or after time expenditure are to be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indeterminate requirements in the tender documents.
The specifications must enable tenderers to submit their tenders safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender should only be made public when the tender documents have been completed.
Divergent regulations
An obligation to tender for works in lots does not exist in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible to decide on the type of service to be commissioned, the public contracting authorities may subdivide construction work into several lots.
In Germany construction work is always divided into lots, separated according to the quantity (partial lots) and / or according to type or subject areas (professional lots).
This should enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of potential suppliers and make price-fixing more difficult.
This type of award is considered the most economical as a rule.
Scoring criteria in the Czech Republic must be indicated in the tender documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This should make it completely and conclusively clear to the applicants which criteria their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the specification of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but no later than in the tender documents, is only required for EU-wide procurement procedures.
In national procurement procedures, the scoring criteria are to be recorded only in an internal administrative award.
Tender documents drawn up by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or participating planners or appraisers in Germany in the structural engineering and in some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the knowledge of the client.
This is also the reason why freelance contractors can neither send nor submit planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or changed services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) are almost always the case for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to some extent, the granting of addenda to the contractor without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be allowed to separate from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a threshold of 20% applies to such award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of a delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the ongoing construction work.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the company already commissioned, the contractor will not be able to arbitrarily increase the prices for these services in accordance with the regulations in Germany.
When determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for the price determination of the order already placed must be assumed.
In addition to supplementary services, it may also lead to a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities can not be offset against additional supplements.
Essential test results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the terms of reference contained references to national technical approvals or standards which had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some specifications also contained product-related requirements - such as for graffiti protection, waterstops or noise barriers - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was eligible.
Bills of services subdivided by sub-services
BRH has not found in any of the audited procedures violations of the obligation to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided into partial services.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of procedures, the tender documents were completed before the tenders were launched.
For some procedures, the tender documents had to be corrected during the bid phase as some positions or deadlines had changed.
Occasionally, the bills of ladders contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
Almost half of a bill of quantities for demolition work consisted of such demand positions.
Lots and scoring criteria
For many awards lacked the mandatory justification, why the mostly out of tenders advertised services were not further divided into parts.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria that are to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
Notes on Freelance Workers
A small part of the specifications contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were in part on the cover pages or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly requested candidates to contact the architect "on questions of tenders".
In particular in the field of building construction, the contracting authorities attributed the alleged complaints mainly to negligence on the part of the freelance contractors responsible for drawing up the specifications.
The construction services pointed to the lack of capacity to adequately control the specifications.
SAO
Technical specifications and product neutral tendering In the public procurement for the construction of a dwelling house with 12 housing units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without giving reasons.
In the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the invitation to tender.
Service descriptions with performance units
For construction projects in some industrial areas, the awarding authority did not clearly state the scope and nature of the required services in the specifications.
As power units, it merely indicated the enclosed space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the construction of a motorway bypass, the specifications were changed four times in the framework of a restricted procedure from August to September 2009,
as the scope of supply had increased significantly and the technical requirements had changed.
Contract documents for social housing included inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary civil engineering studies and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services.
When constructing a large library building, the specification of the interior design contained no product quality requirements.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors built overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.
Lots and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction work into partial lots or the assignment of partial orders is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that, with a selective allocation of selected parts, savings of up to EUR 31.6 million with a total cost of EUR 620.3 million would have been possible.
For example, in the case of six different works, which were the subject of a single contract, it would have been possible to save 2.5 million (25%) on a single lot.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded in bulk, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When awarding construction works in road construction, the central contracting authority made very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority requested from the tenderers, in an open procedure, inter alia, the proof of at least three road projects completed, worth EUR 28 million in each of the past five years.
In the Czech Republic at most nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public award of a different section of a motorway included six separate construction projects in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least € 480 million over the last three years as a suitability criterion for the companies.
Two-thirds of the funds invested in road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (ie € 2.5 billion out of a total of € 3.7 billion) came from a total of five companies that carried out the work alone or as a consortium.
In 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of € 528 million, only two or even one bidder submitted an offer.
The NKÚ pointed out that narrowing the market potential can result in significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the construction of an autobahn bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures when awarding additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear volume and quality requirements, supplements in the first case of up to € 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to € 165.4 million (net), resulting in a respective order volume of 21% and 91, respectively % increased.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several higher education institutions, some services were not included in the tender documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit laid down in national procurement law of 20% of the original contract value, the contracting authority conducted negotiated procedures with the contractors without a contract notice.
In the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiated procedures without a call for tenders.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further findings
On the basis of a sampling of construction projects, NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometer in the Czech Republic is up to € 14.6 million.
In Germany, according to an evaluation of long-term data of the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometer is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison indicates that highway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on the procurement documents are largely consistent in both countries and take into account the EU rules.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and corruption prevention.
For example, the requirement for sufficient certainty in the specifications should enable bidders to reasonably calculate and prepare their tenders,
protect the client against additional services to be agreed later and also limit speculative margins.
The common basic requirements for the procurement documents are supplemented in Germany by regulations that are intended to further reduce competitive restrictions and manipulation options.
In the Czech Republic, there are no such targets, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria in non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for the specification of services have largely been complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations which may have led to restrictions of competition.
The existing requirement in Germany for the formation of lots promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of comprehensive services without lots or with only very large lots can lead to restrictions of the provider field to only a few large companies.
Comprehensive reference requirements in road construction in the Czech Republic have led to public contracts being awarded only to a small number of suppliers and smaller and medium-sized enterprises not being able to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other collusion.
When allocating and compensating for additional or changed benefits, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
According to the EU requirements as well as the German regulations supplementary performance with a value up to half of the main order can under certain conditions be awarded without public procurement procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% up to which additional benefits may be awarded by negotiated procedure without notice to the original contractor.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded
because the scope of services for public contracts is often poorly defined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be put out to public tender.
By splitting benefits into lots, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Define the type of procurement and take into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and tenderers largely unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure, or limit it by specifying non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, pan-European procurement procedures shall apply.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account in particular the European competition law requirements and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of a construction project is at or above the EU threshold of currently € 5,000,000, the construction work can generally be awarded across Europe in open or restricted procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the principle of pan-European procurement and award construction work in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated value of the contract is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum this lot does not exceed 20% of the estimated total value of all works contracts.
A uniform construction project may not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values, in order to avoid the obligation to award the building services in principle throughout Europe.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of procurement as well as the examination of the obligation to apply the EU public procurement rules are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Divergent regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle equality of open and restricted procedures contained in the EU Directive to its works contracts, which are not subject to EU rules.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the need to document or justify the decision. Other methods, however, are possible only under certain conditions defined by law.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national awards - the public invitation to tender have priority. This is determined by the budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the guidelines for the prevention of corruption.
Other types of procurement - as well as the non-open procedure or the restricted invitation to tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be reasonably substantiated and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or public invitation to tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying certain tenderers and to impede possible price fixing among tenderers.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can use the planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organizations to determine the probable costs in the field of public building construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost characteristics for building categories, units of use, building elements or individual building services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the prospective order value of a planned project or of a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for the road construction in Germany have only a few building administrations.
A nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic can not rely on central databases or average price estimates for comparable construction works in determining the likely cost of construction works.
On the contrary, the cost estimates are in most cases based on estimates of the financing body or on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures for the standardization of costing procedures are still in their infancy.
The relevant ministries received the mandate under the Anti-Corruption Plan for 2011-2012 to create a database of standardized building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on the cost of materials and construction and finishing work, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to allow for costing and standard price determination.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects for better cost control,
which is to be used as a benchmark in price setting in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Essential test results BRH
Choice of the award procedure
The audited contracting authorities largely wrote out the construction work in an open procedure or in a public invitation to tender and thus complied with the budgetary and procurement regulations.
In 2011, 59.5% of federal building construction work was publicly advertised or open-ended.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
The choice of non-public procurement methods lacked in-depth reasons why the contracting entities had to depart from the open procedure or public tender procedure.
In a cross-sectional survey, the BRH found on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures that the non-public procurement methods compared to the open procedures and public tenders have significant disadvantages in competition and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders than for restricted tenders and almost three times as many offers as for free-handed assignments.
The investigation also showed that bid prices for restricted tenders and contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher, respectively, than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations of the Federal Ministry of Building and a state audit office confirmed the differences in profitability between public and non-public procurement.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even came up with twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Take into account the EU threshold
As a rule, the contracting authorities assessed the construction projects, for which they had calculated an estimated total contract value of more than EUR 5,000,000, in setting up procurement plans in which they defined the construction works to be awarded under EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, it has always been possible to allocate more than 80% of the works across the EU.
It was not possible to see how the obligation for EU-wide awards could be avoided by over-estimating costs.
However, it partly came as a result of incorrect calculations to the de facto falling below the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures.
During the construction, some contracting authorities improperly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not substantiate these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures was still respected.
For most of the audited construction projects, the share of EU-wide tenders according to the billing results was usually lower than provided for under the procurement plan.
In some cases, in the case of projects above EU thresholds, contracting entities violated the requirement to tender all EUR 1 000 000 and more single lots in EU-wide procedures,
and instead chose national procedures.
SAO
Choice of the award type
In several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects in the context of a major sports event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction work into several partial contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these splits, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently granted in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the price databases that existed in this area were only an insufficient instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data was based on recently completed construction projects, but there were indications of lack of efficiency, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contractors.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values calculated using the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport has revised the databases in order to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, projected values were based on projected cost values or investor estimates.
The actual order values deviated strongly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or extension of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed value of the contract, but eight additions to the construction resulted in a cost increase of EUR 2.1 million or 27%.
Similarly, the actual value of the order to build a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, which also resulted in cost increases during the construction phase.
In other cases, bid prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. In the construction of a court building, the cost increased disproportionately at 139%, as the floor space had only increased by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU rules defining the type of procurement and the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations largely correspond.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public invitation to tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more public companies or public procurement tend to allow more companies to participate in the competition.
Public procurement procedures increase the number of offers and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is considerably improved by not restricting the applicant field by stipulations of the client which are susceptible to manipulation and making price fixing between the bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.
Under Czech law, contracting entities may award contracts by open or restricted procedure.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders in proceedings with previous competition can no longer be limited.
Thus, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely followed the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender. In the Czech Republic, some benefits were divided inappropriately in order to circumvent the rules on the choice of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be identified in Germany that resulted in a shortfall of the minimum share of services tendered throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected cost of construction and construction works.
The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure through further controls that the specifications for the choice of the type of procurement as well as the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are met or the conditions for appropriate costing are established.
Prior information and announcement
In the case of construction projects with construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies in advance of the call for tenders about the planned awards.
Pre-information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information should contain the essential public procurement information on the intended construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the time limits for open or restricted procedures.
Announcements must be made by the contracting authority to specify details of the planned works contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the procedural and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the subject matter of the contract, the common vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV Codes) must be used throughout Europe.
Prior information and notices shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer's profile.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the publication of the notice text to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The EU legislation on prior information and publicity has fully transposed both countries into national law.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, pre-information and notices are to be published also in the case of works not available throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may be started at the earliest one month after the prior information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the Official Gazette (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a prior information be waived.
In Germany, no prior information is required for the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions must be published before restricted tenders on the Federal Internet portal and possibly also in newspapers or magazines.
For restricted tenders without competition, announcements of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
The preliminary information must list all the lots proposed for the construction project.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small number of loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, this scheme has only a minor effect, since much less construction work is split up into lots there.
Essential test results
BRH
preliminary information
The investigated contracting entities published advance information for all construction projects audited with construction works to be awarded Europe-wide.
However, for some open procedures, they shortened the deadlines for submission despite the fact that the 52-day deadline between submission of the pre-information and the notices had not expired.
Other abridged procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of prior information had expired and before it was extended.
For many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the intended allocation of construction work in lots.
Announcements
The notices of the auditees included partly CPV codes which differed from the information given in the pre-information or which did not correctly cover the requested services.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information - eg. For example, the deadlines for implementation - as the notices published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the messages on its own fee-based allocation platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the notifications as prescribed to the free Internet portal of the federal government.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited management's reports were published on this portal.
SAO
Announcements
When creating a wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria by which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority could not prove how the tenderers were selected.
The limitation on the number of bidders was allowed under the then applicable law.
When building a motorway ring, in a restricted procedure, the contracting authority did not specify in the contract notice or documentation of the tendering procedure how to assess the qualifications of the candidates and how many candidates they wanted to admit to the competition.
The contracting authority concluded in its assessment that all six candidates met the qualification requirements but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the rest of the procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because at no point in the procedure had it provided information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure.
Publication of the notices
The awarding authority did not publish the tender for the rehabilitation of the former military site.
Summary findings
The two-stage information and dissemination information system is an important element in implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national awarding area as well:
Selection of candidates for non-public procurement
In contrast to public procurement procedures, in the case of non-public procurement procedures, it is not possible for every undertaking interested in the performance of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a selection in advance of which companies should be invited to submit tenders.
Requirements of EU Law and Preventing Corruption The EU rules allow a limitation of the number of applicants in the EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in restricted procedures, at least five companies must be invited to submit tenders.
At least three companies should be invited for negotiated procurement procedures.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be high enough to ensure real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.
The selection of companies to be solicited is a process within the procurement process which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. B. in this case certain companies can be unilaterally preferred.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favors possible agreements between the applicants.
In both cases, the delivery result may be significantly affected at the expense of the client.
The contracting entities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and in particular ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU rules, contracting entities should change as often as possible among the applicants in the selection of candidates.
Nor should competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.
The contracting entities must justify the selection of the candidates and document the progress of the selection procedure in their awarding notes.
Divergent regulations
In Germany, restricted tenders require at least three and, in case of a private contract, several suitable candidates to tender.
Under the new Czech legislation, except for two specific areas, it is inadmissible to restrict the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, when choosing companies, the multi-eye principle must be observed.
Has z. For example, if an employee proposes a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction department or a contractor from the contracting authority will normally have to amend that proposal, for example by removing a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
This is to prevent a single person from being able to determine the circle of companies to be included in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intent, this could allow far-reaching collusion among the parties.
The list of companies to be invited must be kept confidential and not accessible to the general public, including professionals.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for the preparation and concealment of bidder lists.
According to German regulations, self-employed persons are not allowed to designate the companies to be invited, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.
Essential test results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to request a minimum number of companies to submit tenders in the case of non-public contracts was met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation by the BRH of nearly 7,000 non-pan-European procurement procedures for building construc- tion in building construction showed that contracting authorities requested an average of 6.6 for limited tendering by the federal government in Germany and 4.4 for freelance tenders.
Change of business and regional restrictions
In particular for trades with few suppliers, the contracting entities did not always change the list of selected candidates.
Above all, they took into account already known and, in their view, tried and tested companies.
The reason for this was that in non-public proceedings they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete before the invitation to submit an offer.
An unlawful restriction to regional bidders, the BRH was not found in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting entities attributed this primarily to the fact that the scope of the non-public procurement procedures was, on average, significantly lower and therefore, for B. longer journeys more significant than public tenders.
Multi-Eye Principle and Proposals Freelance
Contrary to the rules, contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular with lacking processing capacities, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge about alternative suitable enterprises.
Often there was no documentation of who had proposed the companies invited to tender.
Some samples showed that self-employed persons had drawn up the lists of candidates and that these proposals had been accepted by the contracting authorities without change.
As a result, the contracting entities did not protect themselves to the necessary extent from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidding lists
For a contracting entity, the lists of companies to be contacted were recorded in a computer system that could be consulted by all the staff of that office.
In the case of manipulative intent, the names of the proposed or approved companies would have been transferred without authorization and B. may allow collusion among these companies.
documentation
The documentation of the tendering procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of applicants.
SAO
Selection of applicants
Bidders did not receive any information on the evaluation criteria and assessment procedures when constructing a motorway ring.
In the restricted procedures for the development and modernization of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one case, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The awarding committee then conducted a lottery to select the companies.
However, this procedure, which was in principle permissible at that time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent inadmissible restrictions of competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the awarding authorities to propose the companies to be invited, the German requirements restrict such abuse possibilities.
In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of a largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can, above all, counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that part of these requirements were implemented only inadequately and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants was not adequately reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely remedy the shortcomings identified.
offer phase
With the announcement of the award or with the invitation to tender, the bidding phase starts in which the companies can submit bids on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants may submit their tenders until the deadline set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities must comply with the national regulations designed to counteract the possibilities of manipulation existing during the bidding phase.
These are mainly organizational requirements and controls.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The tender documents on the basis of which companies are to submit their bids must in principle only be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelance workers involved in the tendering process may not perform this task.
The contracting entity must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In the case of ambiguity in the tender documents or other questions concerning the invitation to tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the candidates.
Freelance workers who are commissioned to prepare the tender documents may not provide any information.
Throughout the bidding phase, contact between the freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
The self-employed should not become a hub in the procurement procedure through which contacts with anticompetitive consequences can be made.
Offers sent by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers must have a technical encryption.
Divergent regulations
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies to print and send out the tender documents, whose employees must be obliged to keep the offers confidential and to ensure the diligent fulfillment of the contractual obligations.
The offers received in Germany must be marked with an entry stamp and sent directly, without delay and unopened to a staff member responsible for safekeeping.
This member of staff may not be involved in the award.
The offers received are to be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority shall record the offer data including order numbers as well as the production and input data in a protocol.
The storage of offers is not specified in the Czech Republic.

BRH
The tenders for the bidding phase focused mainly on the award procedures of a building management.
Dispatch of the tender documents
The contracting authorities of the audited Building Administration Department sent the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelance workers did not send out any tender documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building management department did not meet the requirements for the separation of planning and allocation when naming the contact persons for queries and information.
Contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the awarding authority in the specifications, but from the project management as contact person.
Some of the tender documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had drawn up the specifications.
For requests during the bidding phase, in some cases not all applicants received the same information.
Marking of offers
In the audited building management all received offers were stamped with receipt and receipt.
However, for some freelance tenders, tenders were received by freelancers, which contradicted the rules on preventing corruption.
Keeping the offers
After being marked, not all bids were immediately and immediately sent to the custodian who included the bids in a steel cabinet.
In a construction department, the offers had meanwhile been stored in an open compartment of the post office to which every member of staff had access.
Another department had posted a mailbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which the offers thrown in there sometimes even remained overnight.
Since the deposit slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only employees, but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to take offers received and, if necessary, to manipulate.
SAO
On the Czech side no defects were complained about.
Summary findings
During the bidding phase, in particular, contacts between interested companies and self-employed persons involved in the award procedure are to be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.
The rules on receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of offers appear appropriate to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, tenderers will be bound by their tenders until the end of the contract award period set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
For the opening of the offers no separate EU legal regulations are given.
National anti-corruption regulations, however, contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the offer opening should prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The multi-eyes principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrolled when opening their offers.
For most procurement procedures, bidders can attend the opening date.
For the opening, only offers that were available to the chief negotiator when opening the first offer are allowed.
In principle, late offers must not be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, it is necessary to lay down in a protocol the acts taken and the results of the opening of tenders, including the names of the tenderers and the offer prices.
The protocol is to be read out and signed by the negotiating directors.
It can also be signed by the present bidders.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee carries out the opening of tenders.
It also freelancers can participate.
The committee may also be tasked with other phases of the procurement procedure, such as: B. with the evaluation of the offers.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary perform the bid opening.
The negotiator must be a staff member of the tendering authority.
The chief negotiator and, in the case of building contractors, also the secretary, should not be involved in the processing of the tender documents and in the awarding and contracting.
The minutes of the opening date stipulate that, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and rebates as well as special features such as damaged or delayed tenders must be recorded in accordance with German regulations.
In the Czech Republic, apart from the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made accessible to those directly assigned with the processing.
Corresponding Czech regulations do not exist.
If there is only one offer in a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unsecured.
In Germany there is no such regulation. If there is only one offer, this must be opened and then evaluated.

More-eye principle
The audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the MehrAugen principle at the opening dates.
They conducted the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who had not been commissioned with any other awarding procedures.
However, in the case of freelance awards of lesser scope, there were occasional cases where freelancers opened tenders sent to them without the involvement of the contracting authority.
protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
Some were z. For example, the late-filed offers were not registered; in some cases even signatures were missing.
Marking of offers
The contracting entities examined in the cross-sectional review identified the tenders in accordance with the requirements of a perforation with the date of the opening date.
In the past few audits of some beneficiaries, insufficient labeling had been identified.
However, these contracting entities changed their labeling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
SAO
offer period
For the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the awarding authority one month after expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders. The contracting authority nevertheless accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries for the opening of the offers agree in relevant parts. They take into account both the MehrAugen principle and the principle of transparency. This can significantly limit the risks of corruption and tampering with the opening of tenders.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as the labeling, safekeeping and secrecy of the offers limit manipulation possibilities such. B. subsequent changes to the offers a significant.
In addition, the agents authorized to open the bids may not perform any other tasks related to the service to be awarded.
The total of only a few complaints prove the high acceptance of the specifications for the opening of tenders.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, he has to determine the offer for awarding the contract that best meets the requirements according to the prescribed award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
EU regulations provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the tenderers has to be determined.
Tenderers must be economically and financially sound and have the required professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies are to be excluded from participation in the award procedure. B. are legally convicted of bribery or fraud.
The offers of the non-excluded bidders shall be calculated, technically and economically evaluated and assessed on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. The client has to check special offers with unusually low prices.
The review and evaluation of bids is a particularly susceptible to manipulation phase of the procurement process.
For example, bidders may be unjustifiably excluded or bids that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
By favoring or discriminating against bidders, the result of the evaluation may be unduly impaired and thus the determination of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting entity must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the audit and the evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It also has to ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure as well as the decisions taken.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
In accordance with EU requirements, the offers in both countries are to be examined and assessed in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the proofs of suitability to be submitted by the undertakings and the award criteria to be taken into account in the scoring and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the tender documents and can not be changed during the procedure.
After checking the bidding eligibility, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used when scoring the bids.
The rating must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted tenders must first be formally reviewed as to whether they are complete and whether they are complete. B. abnormalities are included, which could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their bids, they must be informed immediately.
If the evaluation of the tenders reveals an inappropriately low price, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment before any possible exclusion of his tender.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Divergent regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made accessible to persons directly responsible for the processing.
The review of the offers as well as the mathematical examination of the offers may only be carried out by the awarding authority.
It only has to appoint staff members who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the action.
The perception of the further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They must only make suggestions for the decisions to be taken by the contracting entities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the bids.
The committees prepare rating reports with proposed allocations.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required in Germany for the submission of tenders are submitted incompletely, the contracting entity shall give the tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the rating.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether to give tenderers the opportunity to complete any missing documents or declarations.
If this fails a bidder, it must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the bids are to be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that the prices for partial services have been set too low or too high, the tenderer must be asked to resolve these ambiguities.
If this does not succeed and the contracting authority can prove that the prices have been mixed, this offer must be ruled out.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial deliveries when calculating their supply, which can result in significant cost increases for the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is considered, but not the adequacy of the partial service prices.
A mixed calculation can not justify the exclusion of an offer.
On offers with inappropriately high or low prices a surcharge may not be granted in Germany.
If one or more bids fall below the relevant price determination of the contracting entity or the bids submitted by the other bidders by 10% or more, the tenderers must provide evidence of the proper calculation of their bids.
If this is not possible, the contracting authority may exclude the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the invitation to tender may be withdrawn after the economic feasibility study, if only tenders with unjustifiable, low prices are available.
Contrary to the German public procurement law, the bid can not be denied for offers with prices substantially above the calculation of the client for this reason.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behavior in Germany, the contracting entity must report immediately to the level of its technical supervision.
The latter has to decide what measures must be taken and whether the antitrust or prosecution authorities should be informed.
The technical supervision leading level must z. B. also agree on construction work over 50,000 euros, if awarded by private contract, a supplement should not be awarded to the offer with the lowest price or the tender should be canceled.
There are no corresponding regulations in the Czech Republic.

Fitness and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the audited procurement procedures corresponded to the listed specifications.
For some of the companies proposed by the self-employed, the contracting entities did not verify the suitability of the companies themselves.
A beneficiary commissioned companies without the required aptitude documents being completely available.
For some of the procedures, it was not clear whether the contracting entity had taken into account all the award criteria disclosed in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision only on the price criterion.
Selection of the persons involved and secrecy of the offers
Some contracting entities used unauthorized persons for the purpose of examining tenders.
For example, freelance workers or staff involved in the planning or implementation of a project carried out tasks that could only be carried out by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacities in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to examine the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to ensure that the contractual obligations were meticulously met.
For the construction departments, it was mostly unclear whether the offers for freelancers were accessible only to persons directly responsible for processing them.
Review and mathematical examination of offers
Some contracting entities handed over open tenders to self-employed persons for further examination without first having carried out the prescribed review of the tenders and the arithmetical examination themselves and having documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties would have been able to make changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the documents examined, abnormalities or missing price or product details were sometimes not or insufficiently marked.
audit
For a sample in a building management system, the best offers differed by more than 10% from the previously estimated costs in three quarters of the audited procurement procedures.
Every twentieth award procedure was suspended due to inadequate bid prices.
Not all tenders and information meetings with the bidders were traceable or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, further clarifications were missing, such as the unit prices of the most important items.
Frequently, the deviations were only flat-rate reasons, z. By indicating changes in market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services explained that recognizing and proving mixed calculations was difficult.
In the case of a tender issued by a public-law institution, the offer price for the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously estimated estimate of these services.
Further costing checks or studies on the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a discussion, the awarding authority found no evidence of price dumping of the then contracted company.
It therefore remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or the asking price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the commissioned company as a "low-cost company", which could neither meet quality nor deadlines.
In another tender, a construction agency awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the cost of the estimate.
It did not cancel the tender, citing the irrelevant justification that it was possible to draw sufficient estimates from this company.
Suspected irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities in one of the audited building authorities, both of which were reported to the technical supervision level.
In one of the cases, the tendering procedure for two bidders was identical so that the contracting authority excluded both tenders from the procedure.
In the application of the remaining provisions, the tests did not reveal any significant complaints.
SAO
Qualifying Examination
For many of the projects under construction, including university construction, road construction and rail network development, contracting entities did not exclude tenderers from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents or could not demonstrate their suitability to the extent required. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting entity could neither substantiate nor explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had met the requirements.

When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take account of the criteria for the assessment and evaluation of tenders.
In a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the scoring.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion "shortening of the construction phase" was wrongly assessed in a procedure.
As a result, the offered reductions were insufficiently taken into account for the second and third tier bidders.
Documentation of the offer selection
In the case of three contract award procedures, the contracting authority did not document the criteria used and on what basis it had selected the successful tenderer.
When contracting a freeway, the contracting authority selected companies for smaller orders of up to € 20,000 solely on the basis of telephone surveys at prices and delivery conditions.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the interviews were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for checking and rating the offers in both countries comply with EU regulations.
However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ.
In Germany, the procedure is regulated more precisely by detailed requirements, in particular with regard to the implementation of the multiple-eye principle and the protection of offers than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the appropriateness of the offered prices is to be examined.
In both countries, it had to be found in some of the audited procurement procedures that essential procedural steps in the review and evaluation of bids were not documented or insufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of audit and valuation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favored.
A particularly serious defect was the transfer of all offers to third parties, without the contracting authority having sufficiently examined and documented the offers and thus protected them against possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If contracting authorities allow tasks to be carried out by third parties during the examination and evaluation of bids, sufficient precautions and increased control effort are required to counteract the increased risk of manipulation.
When examining the appropriateness of prices, the audited departments in Germany did not always make full use of the set of instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly in the aptitude test and in the application of the scoring criteria.
Completion of the award procedure
After examining and valuing the tenders, the award procedure is concluded by awarding the contract or by canceling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
Companies have the possibility to examine the intended award by electronic means or by fax within 10 days, or by other means of communication within 15 days, and if necessary initiate a review procedure.
Before expiry of this period, a contract may not be concluded.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a tenderer submits a petition for review within the information period, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review procedure.
In addition, companies may have the award decision reviewed by an independent court during this review procedure.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to oblige the client throughout the procurement procedure to observe the procurement law.
For this he must document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented the EU rules on information and review procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority must decide on the award.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client should place the order within the announced additional period,
also because the bidders are no longer bound to their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may not in principle deviate from the offer contents when signing the contract.
The unsuccessful tenderers shall be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not considering their tenders.
Award procedures may only be suspended under certain conditions, eg. For example, if the bid prices are excessive or the bids do not meet the requirements of the call for bids.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, the 10- and 15-day information and waiting obligations prior to the award of the contract also apply to works not available throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide awards.
For the other procedures in Germany tenderers may be informed of the award decision only after the award of the contract.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure should be canceled if only one tender has been received or only one bid has been accepted.
In Germany, the surcharge is also awarded in the case of only one value-added offer, provided that it meets the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Essential test results
BRH
In the case of the audited contracts, there were only a few complaints when concluding the award procedure.
In some cases, companies have already received an order for an EU-wide contract prior to the expiry of the information period, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In addition, order letters contained open-ended procedures in individual cases that deviated from the content of the offer, such as: Eg changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the additional periods.
In the case of an open procedure, therefore, one contracting authority awarded the second lowest bid, since an undertaking offering a discount of 50% would no longer be prepared, at the end of the additional period, to perform the services at the price originally offered.
SAO
In the case of a construction measure in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the offer of the bidder in the contract.
For some contracts, such as road construction maintenance, highway construction and a bypass, the contracting entities concluded the contracts after the legal deadline.
When awarding construction works for the rehabilitation of former military premises, the contracting authority did not forward the notice of contract award to all tenderers until after expiry of the statutory period.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements for completing the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of unsuccessful candidates or tenderers will increase the scope for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in the Czech public procurement law has also extended to awards below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing an order were exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
The building authorities should avoid the identified deficiencies in concluding their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented comprehensibly during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for the individual decisions.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the orders placed must be announced.
The order data are also recorded in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU Law and Preventing Corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
Careful and timely documentation first makes traceability of the award decisions possible.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of tenderers in the case of contract awards above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential element in preventing corruption, as the need to justify award decisions greatly limits the scope for manipulation.
The contract award notice for an EU-wide procurement procedure shall be sent by the respective contracting entity to the EU's Publications Office within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, thereby also implementing the principle of transparency.
In addition, the contracting entities must collect the essential data from their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission annually compiles EU statistics, which enable it to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction works.
Regulations of the German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting obligations into national law.
The documentation and reporting rules for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Divergent regulations
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to disclose issued contracts is not limited to EU-wide awards but also covers the other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, publication is only required for restricted tenders and for free-handed assignments of more than € 25,000 or € 15,000 excluding VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition proceedings will receive information on the awarding of orders.
Essential test results
BRH
documentation
Many of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as: For example, to justify product specifications or refer to national regulations.
In a tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its tender did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting entities did not contain all the evidence needed to document the award procedure.
Notices of order placement
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting authorities failed to publicize the award of contracts.
Further procurement procedures lacked the evidence that the contracting authorities had announced the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical statements included contained the required minimum information. They were created on time and sent.
Ex post transparency
The audited building authorities published in most cases the order data of the closed procurement procedures.
In a construction management, however, it was not due to a transmission error to publish this data.
The building administration noticed this error only after half a year,
so that the order data of the hitherto closed procurement procedures were not published.
SAO
documentation
For construction of a major sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures had considerable shortcomings. These were mainly inaccurate information, such as false bid prices in the minutes of the scoring committees.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Notices of order placement
In several road projects, notices of contracts awarded were published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The documentation regulations and the reporting and reporting requirements are largely in line in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the awarding of orders, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic go slightly further than the requirements in Germany.
The identified deficiencies in the documentation and in the announcements limited in part the orruption-preventive effect of these instruments in the respective award procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The building authorities should continue to improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and the awarding of orders and comply fully with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two key issues which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works by contracting authorities: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The provisions of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Corruption prevention measures not only serve to prevent or at least reduce corruption. They should also avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two SAIs on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, and the comparison of these rules, provide insight into similarities and differences that may help both countries to develop their procurement legislation and to apply it.
Application of the EU public procurement rules
The EU's specifications for the award of construction works have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common ground for the awarding of works and consideration of the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the undertakings involved and transparency of procurement procedures.
The building administrations of both countries have in some cases very extensively reduced these bids through further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transferred the requirements for EU construction works to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the audit offices have shown that the building authorities did not fully comply with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building authorities in Germany should further improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to be able to remedy the reported complaints when implementing the EU regulations.
Above all, the audits in the Czech Republic have identified dangers that affect the profitability of the contracts.
For example, incomplete service descriptions made additional services necessary, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, the cost estimates were usually insufficiently prepared. Excessive skill requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially for transport structures.
corruption prevention
The investigations did not aim to expose cases of corruption,
also because the SAIs do not have the necessary tools for this.
However, the SAIs can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken action against corruption and manipulation in the awarding of works and how these requirements are applied.
In preventing corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition and transparency and controls as central elements of corruption prevention.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction work and tailored to their specific needs.
The relevant regulations sometimes specify very precisely how the precautionary measures must be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender procedure is an appropriate instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction works. Restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analysis and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eye principle), transparency requirements and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organizational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
Therefore, the BRH does not see any fundamental need for amendment of the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the awarding of construction services.
The rules for the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have revealed shortcomings in the implementation of some requirements.
The building authorities should further train their employees on the guidelines for corruption prevention and raise their awareness of this issue even more.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to the self-employed.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, delegating tasks increases the risk of abuse.
Tampering and corruption-prone tasks should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can thereby ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.
SAO
At the governmental level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which public procurement is the most important element.
The Public Procurement Act and the associated implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The tests of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The adopted strategy and new legislation are likely to be effective improvement measures as contracting entities justify the economics of order placement, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the assessments and duly document and publish all these aspects have to.
recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH generally rate the implementation of EU regulations as positive.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's rules of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also be used as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and non-material damage potential through manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of audit see the construction authorities in their countries called upon to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and to improve them if necessary.
In particular, the organization and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously analyzed for vulnerabilities and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures can provide wider scope for competition and significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction into lots may have a favorable effect on bid prices, provided that this increases competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient public procurement by contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialized building authorities. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are carried out by the ministries themselves or contractors appointed by them.
The audit offices of both countries have the desire, even after completion of their joint project, to further develop the insights that are important to them and, if necessary, to pass them on to the parliament and government of their country.
Both SAIs are also convinced that the principles of procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are of international interest to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). For the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to counteract corruption effectively and to guarantee the economic award of construction works in a well-functioning and fair competition.
