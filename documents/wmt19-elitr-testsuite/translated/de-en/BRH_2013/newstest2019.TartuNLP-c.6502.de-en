Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report by the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Sao) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both for the State and for the economy.
The role of the State is to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition also across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements for their awards above certain thresholds.
To this end, EU Member States must transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it remains for each country to regulate public procurement itself.
The award of benefits is also an area at risk of corruption.
Therefore, because of the generally high potential for damage, contracting authorities should take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits when awarding their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Sao) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both on the EU-wide award of construction services and on the prevention of corruption.
The audit focused on the application of EU public procurement law, each transposed into national legislation, and the prevention of corruption in the award of civil works in civil engineering, road construction and transport infrastructure.
Spending below the EU thresholds has also been included in the considerations with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit findings of both Courts are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report should also address international bodies such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited bodies The assessments of the Federal Court of Auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits carried out in 2011 / 2012 by the construction administrations for road and civil engineering. the federal government is responsible in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.
In addition, the Bundesrechnungshof used results from previous investigations.
The Chief Inspectorate of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011, including road construction, railway construction, water construction, civil engineering (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.). as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the federal public procurement is carried out predominantly by the construction administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, the allocations are implemented in a decentralised way by the bodies using the public budget.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in sub-contracting procedures.
Differences in public procurement law and market structure for construction services in both countries should be taken into account when comparing the evaluations.
Structure of procurement law in both countries
In Germany, EU-wide procurement procedures are laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures restricted to national areas are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions on which they are based.
For both EU-wide and national public procurement, many complementary individual schemes are provided for by internal administrative provisions;
For example, the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, which supplement or clarify the legal provisions in accordance with the case law on public procurement.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the public procurement law and other legal provisions applicable both above and below the EU thresholds.
Public procurement law was substantially revised in 2012.
The new regime increased transparency in the handling of public funds, allowed greater competition and limited the possibility of corruption in the procurement process.
Guiding principles of procurement law in both countries
In both countries, EU-wide procurement is subject in particular to the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold should be subject to national contract types (public tendering, restricted tendering, free procurement) which, however, are broadly equivalent to those mentioned throughout the EU.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of "open procedure" (for EU-wide public procurement) and "public procurement" (for national public procurement).
In the case of an open procedure and in the case of a public tender, any interested company may submit an offer.
Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction measure into technical and partial buildings.
The individual award of these lots aims to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above-mentioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
In Germany, there are over 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures should also apply to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception is the simplified procedure where a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
The Czech public procurement law contains provisions in accordance with EU law whereby contracts are to be concluded when competition is ensured and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legislation in the Czech Republic allows contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, some 1,900 of which have 20 or more employees.
Volume of contracting authorities and share of contracting entities in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to €307 billion.
Of this, €45.5 billion was spent on public construction (15%), which included, in addition to federal construction, in particular construction activities of the Länder and municipalities.
The federal building volume in construction and construction of distance roads (excluding railway infrastructure and waterway construction) amounted to €8.5 billion.
The volume of contracts for civil engineering and road construction by the federal government was distributed among the contract types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders, and 6.6% negotiated procedures and freedoms lengthy awards.
Of these, 33.2% were pan-European spending.
The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to €4.7 billion in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to €7.8 billion, corresponding to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of contract for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contract volumes below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data cover all public procurement contracts for supply, services and construction services awarded by public contracting entities in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant proportion of public procurement, which has a significant financially effective role in preventing corruption in all awards, and in the award of contracts which: procedures and public procurement are of paramount importance
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Sao) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel checks in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both Courts compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the fields of construction and road construction.
They noted in essence:
The EU directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to EU standards, anti-corruption is also affected by the procurement arrangements of both countries, some of which differ in their priorities and details (point 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the award documents is that they must contain all the information needed to make an appropriate offer.
The performance descriptions shall be neutral and shall not be subject to restrictive competition rules.
In Germany, the award documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it remains a problem to adequately determine the subject-matter of the contract.
In Germany, construction services must be divided as loosely as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the BRH, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, the Sao found, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of substantial services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and restrict it to only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and pose the risk of price or other arrangements.
Under the provisions of both countries, contracting entities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the undertakings already entrusted with additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (no. 4.1).
The two countries mainly complied with the respective criteria for determining the type of award.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting entities may choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, however, the statutory and budgetary primacy of the open procedure applies to EU-wide public procurement, which corresponds to the open procedure for national public procurement.
This will allow more companies to offer.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price agreements between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations generally awarded construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases for public buildings are used, in particular in construction,
The construction projects completed on the basis of the evaluations.
A database is used in the road construction sector in the Czech Republic, but it is not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).
Preliminary information and notices should be published for construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, with the aim of increasing competition by allowing interested businesses to adapt to the intended contracts at an early stage.
The construction administrations audited generally complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or missing controls may have affected competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and shall be announced beforehand.
In addition to EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should switch as often as possible to the companies to be called upon when selecting candidates.
There are some very detailed requirements in Germany to deal with the risk of manipulation.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take account of these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the selection decisions were not always understandable (point 4.4).
In both countries, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in a tender receive the same information during the supply phase in order to ensure equal opportunities for competition.
Contact between these undertakings and with professionals involved in the production of the service description should be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The rules are more extensive in Germany than in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited building authorities in Germany did not partially comply with these requirements (point 4.5).
When opening up offers, both countries should pay particular attention to the multi-eyed principle and the principle of transparency.
The requirements for the labelling, documentation, preservation and confidentiality of tenders are intended to reduce the scope for manipulation and are specifically defined in Germany.
The tests in both countries showed few complaints (point 4.6).
The examination and evaluation of tenders in both countries shall be determined by guidelines on the organisation of structures and procedures.
The rules in Germany are more comprehensive but have not been fully observed by the audited contracting entities.
For example, contracting entities submitted offers for examination to third parties without having previously examined the offers and sufficiently documented the facts.
The offers were therefore insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (point 4.7).
When completing EU-wide procurement procedures, the parties will be informed of the intended contract before awarding the contract.
This possibility of redress also has a preventive function against corruptive behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review option for non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting entities fail to comply with the deadlines for the award of contracts or deviated from the tenderers' offer in terms of content (point 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the construction authorities in both countries.
The EU-wide transparency requirement has not been sufficiently implemented in some procurement notices.
Some of the shortcomings identified also diminished the anti-corruption function of documentation.
Their reporting and reporting obligations were largely fulfilled by the contracting authorities of both countries (point 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and anti-corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union in the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted, inter alia, the Directive on coordination of awards and the Directive on remedies, which Member States have adopted in national law8. to be implemented.
The general principles governing the award of contracts in the European Union are, in particular, the prohibition of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the prohibition of transparency.
To achieve these objectives, the procurement coordination directive contains specific rules for construction works to be awarded throughout the EU.
To achieve this, their estimated contract amounts must reach or exceed €5,000,000 at present.
The arrangements concern in particular the content of the contract documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, including for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the contract award procedure, the requirements relating to the qualification of the contract. candidates can be placed and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, the undertakings concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption means the abuse of confidence to the private advantage,
It is initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the worldwide cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may undermine confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public purchasers.
They will have to review the structure and structure of their administrations in areas particularly vulnerable to corruption in order to provide appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making to corruptive abuse.
The award of public works services is considered to be a particularly vulnerable area of work.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery, as well as advantage-taking and authorisation – is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has adopted a directive and recommendations on prevention of corruption12 in the Federal Administration. in addition to risk analysis, the following principles should be taken into account for the awarding sector in particular: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyed principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, award and settlement, accurate and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, other anti-corruption requirements have been included in public procurement rules.
For example, in 2011, the competent Federal Ministry for Distance Road Contracts introduced an electronically-supported control system,
Data on contracts, such as estimated costs and contract amounts, as well as information on the freelance workers involved are collected across the board and evaluated for fragility.
Corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law in the Czech Republic.
The legal provisions on transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, are the main foundations for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has identified anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on anti-corruption for 2011-2012 and updated them for 2013-2014.
Some of the measures recommended have already been transposed into national public procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions14.
The new legislation essentially contains the following rules: reduction of thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation for the contracting authority to publish the contracts beforehand, including the reasons for the tender, prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in non-open procedures and thus abolition of the possibility of selecting bidders through lot procedures, introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors. "
Results of each stage of the procurement procedure
Contract documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information needed by the tenderers for an appropriate preparation of the tender.
In particular, the award documents must allow for an accurate calculation.
They shall not be allowed to transfer to the tenderers any risks which they cannot calculate.
The contract documents shall consist in particular of the service description and the contractual terms and conditions.
They shall also include the criteria for proof of the qualification (suitability) of the tenderers and the criteria relevant to the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are specifically addressed to the technical specifications.
They should be equally accessible to all tenderers and should limit competition as little as possible.
In principle, the service description must be product-neutral.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the description of performance is only allowed under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in the tendering documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents should be avoided as they provide room for speculation when preparing the tenders and for manipulation when evaluating them.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Similar or similar arrangements In both countries, EU rules on technical specifications are transposed into national law.
The services must in principle be tendered on a product-neutral basis without a specification of the manufacturer.
In the service descriptions, each service must normally be subdivided into service units with the respective quantities.
Prices must be agreed on the basis of service units (e.g. euro per m 2 or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by means of functional objectives.
In any event, the service descriptions must be complete and clear.
They must contain accurate quantities and must not include services which do not determine whether they are needed.
Remuneration by flat rate or time should be avoided as far as possible.
The purpose of these provisions is to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indeterminate specifications in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable tenderers to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The tender should not be published until the contract documents have been completed.
Different arrangements
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in lots in the Czech Republic.
Where possible according to the type of service to be charged, public contracting entities may divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction works must in principle be divided into lots, separately by quantity (portions) and / or by type or subject area (s).
The aim is to enable SMEs to participate in competition, to increase the number of potential suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is usually considered to be the most economical.
Evaluation criteria must be indicated in the procurement documents in the Czech Republic for both EU-wide and national procedures.
The aim is to ensure that candidates are fully and conclusively aware of the criteria under which their offers are to be assessed.
In Germany, valuation criteria are required in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the award documents, only for EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria shall only be set out in an internal procurement notice.
Contract documents drawn up by contracted professionals may not contain any references to these offices or planners or experts involved in the construction and some road construction administrations in Germany.
The aim is to prevent individual undertakings from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the knowledge of the contracting authority concerning their contact with those professionals.
This is also the reason why freelance contracting documents may not be sent or interpreted for inspection.
The contact point for businesses is the contracting authority alone.
There is currently no provision for this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) almost always apply to large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of contracts to the undertaking already commissioned without the need to conduct a public procurement procedure.
According to EU and German provisions, the remuneration of supplementary services must not exceed half of the principal contract.
Moreover, the additional services must not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a closer 20% threshold applies to awards without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the undertaking already appointed, the German rules do not allow an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor in principle.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the prices of the contract already awarded should be taken into account.
In addition to supplementary services, the scope of services may also be reduced.
In the Czech Republic, minority quantities cannot be charged with additional supplementary benefits.
Main results of the audit
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering
In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards which had already been replaced by European-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications – such as graphite protection, joint tapes or noise protection plates – without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was eligible.
Lists of performance broken down by partial performance
The BRH has not found any infringement of the obligation to tender services in principle in a list of services broken down by partial services in any of the procedures examined.
Completeness of service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the contract documents were completed before the commencement of tenders.
For some procedures, the tender documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In isolation, the performance lists contained positions where they were not determined whether they were needed.
Almost half of the performance index for demolition consisted of such demand positions.
Loose and valuation criteria
Many contracts lacked the required justification for the failure to divide the services largely advertised by professionals into poles.
There were no objections to the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the tenders.
References to freelance workers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the professionals involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the candidates to contact the architect "on tender issues."
In particular in the construction sector, the contracting authorities mainly attributed the reported complaints to the failure of the freelance workers responsible for drawing up the service descriptions.
The building services pointed to the lack of capacity to adequately control the performance descriptions.
Sao
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In public procurement for the construction of a dwelling house with 12 units, a supplier and a specific product mark were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of similar products without justification.
The tender also specified suppliers and products for the establishment of several higher education establishments.
Performance descriptions of service units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly indicate the extent and nature of the necessary services in the service descriptions.
As performance units, it merely indicated the converted space of each building in cubic metres.
Completeness of service descriptions
In the context of the construction of an motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were amended four times during the period August to September 2009 in the context of an open procedure,
As the volume of services increased significantly and the technical conditions changed.
Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary construction studies and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be contracted.
In the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior design did not contain product quality requirements.
As a result of these missing standards, some sub-contractors built overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.
Loose and suitability criteria
In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation to divide construction operations into Teillose or to award partial contracts.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were awarded separately, savings of up to €31.6 million would have been possible for a total cost of €620.3 million.
For example, it would have been possible to save €2.5 million (25%) for six different buildings subject to a single contract alone.
If the construction of 20 bridges were awarded separately, savings would have been possible compared to a total allocation of €11.5 million (25%).
As regards the award of construction works in road construction, the central contracting authority provided very comprehensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.
During the construction of a part of a motorway, the contracting authority requested the tenderers in an open procedure, inter alia, to prove at least three road construction projects worth EUR 28 million each over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another part of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects for which the contracting authority had established an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million as a suitability criterion for the companies over the last three years.
Two-thirds of the funds spent on road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. €2.5 billion of a total of €3.7 billion) were contracted by a total of five companies carrying out the contracts either alone or as a working group.
For 46 procurement procedures with a contract value of EUR 528 million, only two or even one tenderer submitted an offer.
The Sao showed that a reduction in market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional benefits
In the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures for the award of additional services in two cases and did not conclude written contracts for the additional services.
Because of unclear quantity and quality requirements, supplements were generated in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to EUR 165.4 million (net), increasing the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several higher education establishments, some services were not included in the award documents, although their need was already known when awarding the contract.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the 20% threshold laid down in national public procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiated procedures with the contracting authorities without publication of a contract notice.
When building a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiated procedures without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority increased the volume of work by €2 million.
The unit prices for the non-competitive additional construction services were significantly higher than those provided by the same company.
Further observations
On the basis of a sample examination of construction projects, the Sao found that the average cost of constructing a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic was up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, however, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to €10.4 million, following an evaluation of long-term data by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement of adequate definition of the service descriptions should enable tenderers to calculate and prepare their offers in an appropriate manner;
Protect the contracting authority against additional services to be subsequently agreed and also reduce speculation space.
The common basic requirements on award documents are supplemented in Germany by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no such benchmarks, but transparency is enhanced by the publication of valuation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.
The performance description requirements have been largely complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be criticised, which could also have led to restrictions on competition.
The lot-making requirement in Germany encourages competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to audit findings of the Sao, the award of substantial services without lots or with very large lots may result in restrictions on the field of operators to a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements imposed in the Czech Republic in road construction have led to public contracts being awarded only to a narrow range of suppliers and not allowing smaller and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition.
A limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.
As regards the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, regulatory approaches differ from one country to another.
Under EU and German rules, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the principal contract may be awarded without public procurement under certain conditions.
The Czech Republic has a closer 20% threshold up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure without notification.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
The scope of public procurement services is often inadequately determined.
If the overrun is greater than 20%, the additional services must be tendered with a public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions of competition and the resulting adverse effects can be avoided.
Defining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By specifying the type of award, the contracting authority shall determine the number of companies participating in the competition.
It may leave the range of potential candidates and tenderers to a large extent unrestricted, for example by selecting an open procedure, or by imposing non-public award procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, pan-European procurement procedures shall apply.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
In choosing the type of award, the contracting authority shall take into account, in particular, the requirements of European law relating to competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of a project's construction works is equal to or above the current EU threshold of €5,000,000, construction works must in principle be awarded throughout Europe using open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European award of construction projects which reach or exceed the EU threshold and may award construction services in national contracts, provided that the estimated contract each lot is less than €1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total value of all works contracts.
A single construction project should not be divided into individual measures without a necessary reason or deliberately estimated at too low costs in order to avoid the obligation to award construction services in principle throughout Europe.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the choice of award procedure and the verification of the application of the EU public procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed EU rules on procurement procedures and thresholds into national law.
Different arrangements
The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle of equal treatment between open and non-open procedures contained in the EUR Directive to its works contracts, which are not subject to EU standards.
There is a freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure without the need to mention or justify the decision, while other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, however, the open procedure or – in the case of national contracts – the public tender is in principle a priority, as determined by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the anti-corruption directives.
Other types of awards, such as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender procedure, are only possible in exceptional cases which are finally regulated by public procurement law.
The existence of an exception shall be understandably justified and documented.
The principle of "open procedure" or "public tender" is designed to ensure as unrestricted competition as possible, exclude possibilities of manipulation by setting certain tenderers and possible price agreements between tenderers. difficulties.
The principle of public tendering in Germany is a central element in the prevention of corruption.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
Building services in Germany can use planning and cost databases from public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs of public building.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects, including cost indicators for building categories, utility units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost indicators, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction performance to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction only have some construction administrations in Germany.
Nevertheless, a nationwide introduction is foreseen for all road construction administrations.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic cannot use central databases or average price investigations of comparable construction measures to determine the expected costs of construction works.
In the majority of cases, cost investigations are based on estimates of the funding body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the building service.
Measures to standardise cost investigations are still in the process of being implemented.
Within the framework of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the competent ministries were mandated to establish a database on standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material costs, construction and development facilities, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to allow for cost investigations and determination of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a collection of data for construction projects to improve cost control.
Which is to be used as a benchmark when setting prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Main results of the BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited contracting entities largely wrote out the construction services in the open procedure or in the public tender procedure and thus followed the budgetary and public procurement rules.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services were publicly procured in civil engineering and open procedures.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
In the choice of non-public tenderers, some detailed reasons were lacking as to why contracting entities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tender.
In a cross-sectoral investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public tenderers have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders and that manipulation and corruption increase risk.
In construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted in public tenders as in restricted tenders and almost three times as many offers were submitted in the case of freelance contracts.
The study also showed that on average tender prices for restricted tenders and contracts for freelancers were 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel studies carried out by the Federal Ministry of Buildings and a State Court of Auditors confirmed the differences in economic efficiency between public and non-public contracts.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Buildings even experienced twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of construction projects for which they had calculated an estimated total contract amount of more than EUR 5 000 000, the audited contracting entities generally established award schedule in which the construction services to be awarded throughout the EU as well as those to be awarded under national procurement procedures. established.
According to the procurement plans, more than 80% of construction services were always to be awarded throughout the EU.
It was not possible to avoid the commitment to EU-wide expenditure through too low-cost estimates.
However, in some cases erroneous calculations resulted in actual undercutting of the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures.
During construction, some contracting entities were unacceptably changing the definitions of their award schemes.
They did not substantiate these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was still respected.
For most of the construction measures audited, the proportion of EU-wide expenditure was generally lower than foreseen in the award scheme according to the results of the calculation.
In some cases, contracting entities for construction projects above the EU threshold were in breach of the requirement to tender for every €1,000,000 or more individuals in EU-wide procedures;
And instead chose national procedures.
Sao
Choice of award method
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting entities divided construction services into several subcontracting contracts, although these services were similar or comparable. goods.
As a result, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in breach of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated contract value
In the field of road construction, the price databases in this area were insufficient to determine the expected contract values.
The data were based on construction projects just completed, but there were indications of a lack of economic viability, unnecessary additional performance or excessive profits from the firms involved.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were approximately 37% lower than expected contract values determined by the database.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In construction, the expected contract values were based on cost estimates estimated by the project architects or on investor estimates.
The actual contract values were very different from the estimates.
The estimated price for the renovation or development of a large library was twice as high as the contract value agreed later, but eight contracts resulted in a cost increase of €2.1 million or 27% as a result of construction.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library repository was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by EUR 16 million or 22%, while the cost of building a judicial building increased disproportionately by 139%, as the area of use had only increased by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed EU rules to define the type of award and to take account of the EU threshold into national law, which is why they are broadly consistent.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in force in Germany goes beyond the EU rules and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procurement procedures or public procurement procedures.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the applicant's field through susceptible definitions by the contracting authority and making price agreements between tenderers more difficult.
The studies confirmed the advantage of the primacy of the open procedure or of the public tendering procedure in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, contracting entities may award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
Following the latest changes in the public procurement law, the number of tenderers may no longer be restricted in previous competition proceedings.
As a result, the open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, contracting entities have largely complied with the priorities of the open procedure or public tendering procedure, and in the Czech Republic, some benefits have been inadmissible in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of tender.
Taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be found in Germany which resulted in a lowering of the minimum proportion of services advertised across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to be able to accurately determine the expected costs of construction services and construction projects.
Construction administrations should ensure, where appropriate, that they comply with the requirements for choosing the type of contract and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU and that the conditions for accurate cost investigations are established.
Preliminary information and communication
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested businesses about the contracts already in the run-up to the tendering procedure.
Pre-information and communication form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The preliminary information shall contain the essential elements of the procurement law concerning the planned construction projects.
They are necessary for those construction projects where the estimated total value of the contract reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority intends to shorten the deadlines for offering open or non-opened procedures.
In notices, the contracting authority shall give details of the planned works contracts to be awarded throughout Europe in a mandatory manner.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
It shall communicate, inter alia, the scope of performance, the procedural and execution dates, the specific requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
The Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes) vocabulary shall be used for the description of the subject-matter of the contract.
Preliminary information and notices shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the contracting authority's procurement profile.
In order to prevent the disadvantage of foreign stakeholders, notices should not contain additional information at national level and should not be made available to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union until they have sent the notice.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulations.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on pre-information and notification into national law.
Different arrangements
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices should also be published on non-European construction services.
Procurement procedures may be started at least one month after the preliminary information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a preliminary information be waived.
In Germany, no preliminary information is necessary for non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, public tender notices and competitions shall be published on the federal website and, where appropriate, in newspapers or magazines prior to restricted invitations to tender.
In the case of restricted invitations to tender without competition, notifications of services to be awarded from €25,000 (ex-ante transparency) are required.
The preliminary information shall specify all planned lots of construction projects.
In Germany, this is particularly important because of the small part of the losses.
In the Czech Republic, the effect of this scheme is limited due to the significantly lower distribution of construction services into lots.
Main results of the audit
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities examined shall publish preliminary information on all the construction projects audited with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened supply periods, although the 52-day deadline between the dispatch of the preliminary information and the notifications had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were advertised only after the twelve-month period of validity of the preliminary information expired and before it was extended.
Many preliminary information published lacked references to the planned breakdown of construction works into lots.
Notice
The notifications of the audited bodies contained in part CPV codes which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not correctly record the required services.
In individual cases, notices were previously published at national level or contained more information – e.g. on the deadlines for implementation – than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited construction administration had entrusted a service provider with the publication of the national procurement procedures.
It published the notifications on its own paid awarding platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had transmitted the notifications, as required, to the federal free internet portal.
Samples showed that only one third of the notifications from the audited administration were published on this portal.
Sao
Notice
When building a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not indicate in its notification the criteria on the basis of which it wanted to select the tenderers.
The contracting authority could not prove how the tenderers were selected.
The limitation of the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at that time.
When constructing a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in a non-open procedure, either in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, how it wanted to assess the qualifications of the candidates and how many candidates it wanted to compete.
The contracting authority's assessment concluded that all six candidates met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst assessments from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because it did not provide information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time of the procedure.
Publication of notices
In the context of the renovation of former military sites, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with pre-information and notification is an important element in implementing the transparency of pan-European procurement, increasing competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU standards and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures also in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public awards
In contrast to public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures do not allow any undertaking interested in the performance of the services to be awarded to participate in competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority shall select in advance which undertakings are to be invited to submit tenders.
Requirements of EU law and anti-corruption The EU rules allow a limitation of the number of candidates in non-public procurement procedures across the EU.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies must be invited to submit tenders.
At least three companies shall be invited to negotiate with a contract notice.
In any event, the number of candidates invited must be sufficient to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.
The selection of companies to be requested is an operation within the procurement procedure that is highly vulnerable to manipulations, e.g. by giving unilateral preference to certain companies.
Moreover, restricting competition to few companies also favours possible agreements between candidates.
In both cases, the outcome of the contract may be significantly affected at the expense of the contracting authority.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special measures against possible manipulations, carry out adequate controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The arrangements for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to EU standards, contracting entities should switch as often as possible between the companies to be called upon when selecting candidates.
Competition must not be restricted to companies established in certain regions.
The contracting authorities shall state the reasons for the selection of candidates and document the selection procedure in their procurement documents.
Different arrangements
In Germany at least three tenders should be restricted and in principle several suitable tenderers should be invited to tender.
The new Czech legislation does not allow the number of tenderers to be restricted in non-open procedures and negotiated procedures, with the exception of two specific areas.
In Germany, the choice of companies must respect the "multi-eye" principle.
For example, where an employee has proposed a number of undertakings for a non-public award procedure, the management level of the building service or a contracting authority must normally change this proposal by exempting a proposed undertaking, for example: complement the undertaking and / or a new undertaking.
The aim is to prevent a single person from finally determining the circle of the undertakings to be competing.
Otherwise, this could allow far-reaching agreements among stakeholders in the event of manipulative intentions.
The list of companies to be requested should be treated confidentially, including with regard to professionals, and should not be made publicly available.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no rules on the establishment and confidentiality of candidate lists.
Under the German rules, professionals are not allowed to determine the undertakings to be called upon, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.
Main results of the audit
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit tenders for non-public tenders has been respected, with few exceptions.
An analysis of the BRH of nearly 7,000 non-European procurement procedures for civil engineering works revealed that the average number of contracting entities in Germany was 6.6 for limited invitations to tender and an average of 4.4 for freelance contracts.
Change of business and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of industries with few suppliers, contracting entities did not always change the circle of selected candidates.
They took particular account of well-known and proven companies.
As a result, they stated that, in non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the undertakings to be competitive prior to the invitation to tender.
The BRH did not find an unauthorised restriction to regional tenderers in non-public procurement procedures, but probably a higher proportion of regionally established companies than in public tenders.
This was mainly due to the fact that the average level of services in non-public procurement procedures was significantly lower and that, for example, longer routes were more important than in public procurement procedures.. "
Multi-eyear principle and proposals for freelance workers
Contrary to the rules, contracting entities are mainly responsible for allowing an independent person to modify the proposed list of companies to be requested.
They justified this in particular by a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to submit tenders.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of candidates and that these proposals had been accepted by the contracting authorities unchanged.
This did not protect contracting entities to the extent necessary against possible manipulations.
Confidentiality of lists of bidders
In the case of a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all the staff of that service.
In the event of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or approved undertakings would have been unauthorised and could have enabled, for example, agreements between these undertakings.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only a few justifications for the selection of candidates.
Sao
Selection of applicants
When building a motorway ring, the tenderers did not receive any information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not contain information on how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of eligible companies.
The Awarding Committee then carried out a lottery procedure for the selection of companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle allowed at the time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special measures to prevent undue restrictions of competition.
By means of the multi-eyed principle, the confidentiality of the lists of bidders and the sole power of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be invited, the German rules limit such abuses.
In particular, the newly introduced requirement for the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public procedures may prevent possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have not been sufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation of abusive restrictions on the subscriber's field has not been sufficiently reduced in such cases.
Contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings identified.
Offering phase
With the publication of the tender or the invitation to tender, the offering phase begins, during which companies can prepare tenders on the basis of the contract documents sent to them.
Applicants may submit their offers until the expiry of the deadline set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU rules for this stage of the award procedure.
Contracting entities must respect national rules to counteract the possibilities of manipulation existing during the tender phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The contract documents on the basis of which companies are to prepare their tenders shall in principle be sent only by the contracting authority.
Freelancers participating in the award procedure shall not be allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority shall ensure that all candidates receive the same information during the tender phase.
In the event of uncertainty about the contract documents or other questions relating to the tendering procedure, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelance workers who are responsible for drawing up the contract documents may not provide any information.
During the whole offering phase, contacts should be avoided between the contracted professionals and the candidates.
Professionals should not be allowed to become a turntable of the award procedure through which contacts can be established with anti-competitive consequences.
Tenders shall be submitted by post or directly transmitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers shall have a technical encryption.
Different arrangements
In Germany, the contracting authority may also commission the printing and dispatch of the contract documents to external service companies whose staff are required to keep the tenders confidential and to carry out the contractual obligations conscientiously.
The offers received must be marked with a receipt stamp in Germany and sent directly, without delay and without delay to an official responsible for the detention.
Such staff shall not be involved in the procurement process.
The offers received shall be kept closed until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority shall keep the tender data, including the order numbers and the preparation and receipt information, in a protocol.
The preservation of tenders in the Czech Republic is not further regulated.
Main results of the audit
BRH
The offer phase audits focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a construction administration.
Dispatch of contract documents
The contracting entities of the audited building management sent the contract documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service provider.
Freelancers did not send any contract documents.
Information to candidates
The audited building management largely did not comply with the planning and procurement separation requirements when designating the contact points for questions and information.
In contrast to the requirements, the service descriptions did not identify staff from the contracting authority but from the project management as a point of contact.
Some contract documents even included the names of the freelance workers who had drawn up the service descriptions.
In the case of demands during the supply phase, not all candidates received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of tenders
All offers received were accompanied by entry stamps and entry notes for the audited building management.
For some freelance contracts, however, the offers were received by freelance workers, which was contrary to the preliminary remarks for preventing corruption.
Keeping offers
After their labelling, not all offers reached immediately and without delay the staff responsible for the storage, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were submitted in an open section by the post office to which each of the staff had access.
Another service had hung a letterbox in a hall which was not constantly monitored, some of the offers received there remaining even overnight.
Because the slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to take out and, if necessary, manipulate the offers received.
Sao
No defects were criticised on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the supply phase, contacts between interested companies and those involved in the procurement process will be prevented in both countries.
In addition, the principle of equal treatment is to be respected by all tenderers receiving the same information.
The rules on receipt, storage and confidentiality of offers appear appropriate to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding benchmarks in Germany are slightly more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The findings of the investigation in Germany have revealed infringements of the rules in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up offers
Opening up offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their content will be read and made public.
From the opening date, the tenderers shall be bound by their tenders until the expiry of the contracting authority's deadline for awarding the contract.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU rules for the opening of tenders.
However, the national anti-corruption rules provide for a comprehensive set of requirements to protect offers and competition during this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure.
The multi-eyed principle, as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of tenders, should prevent manipulation and changes in submitted tenders.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be designated by the contracting authority.
The multi-eyear principle aims to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate offers uncontrolled when opening up offers.
For most procurement procedures, tenderers may participate on the opening date.
Only offers submitted to the negotiating director when the first offer was opened are allowed for opening.
In principle, late tenders may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the acts undertaken and the results of the opening of tenders shall be recorded in a record, including the names of the tenderers and the tender prices.
The Protocol shall be read and signed by the negotiating director.
It may also be signed by the tenderers present.
Different arrangements
In the Czech Republic, a committee shall carry out the opening of tenders.
Freelance workers can also participate in this process.
The Committee may also be entrusted with further stages of the procurement procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a negotiating director and a writer perform the opening of tenders.
The negotiating manager must be an official of the tendering body.
The negotiating director and the writer should not be involved in the processing of the contract documents, as well as in the award and execution of the contract.
In addition to offer prices, the minutes of the opening date shall include information on discounts and discounts as well as on special features such as damaged or delayed bids.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.
The German rules stipulate that the offers opened must be labelled in all parts in such a way as to prevent subsequent changes and additions.
Tenders are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date and must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing.
The Czech legislation does not exist.
If, in the case of a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, only one tender is submitted, the tender shall not be opened and shall be returned without value.
There is no such scheme in Germany; if only one offer is received, it should be opened and then evaluated.
Main results of the audit
BRH
Multi-eyed principle
The audited contracting entities implemented the multi-eyes principle at the opening dates.
They conducted the opening dates with negotiating directors and writers who were not entrusted with any other contract.
In the case of freelance contracts, however, there were isolated cases where freelance contractors opened up offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes
The opening of tenders was not always fully documented in the minutes of the opening dates.
In some cases, for example, the late submitted tenders were not registered, and in some cases there were even no signatures.
Labelling of tenders
The contracting entities examined in the context of the cross-sectional review characterised the tenders in accordance with the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
Inadequate labelling has been found during long-term testing of some recipients.
However, these contracting entities changed their labelling practices after the BRH ’ s complaint.
Sao
Deadline for tenders
When awarding road conservation measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the tender period, but the contracting authority accepted the offer.
Summary findings
Both countries' offer-opening arrangements are substantially consistent, taking into account both the "multi-eye" principle and the "transparency" principle, which may lead to risks of corruption and manipulation when opening up offers. substantially limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for accurate documentation of the procedure as well as labelling, secure storage and confidentiality of tenders significantly restrict possibilities for manipulation, such as subsequent changes to tenders.
In addition, the contracting authorities responsible for the opening of tenders shall not perform any other tasks relating to the service to be awarded.
Overall, only a few complaints demonstrate the high level of acceptance of the opening up of tenders.
Examination and evaluation of tenders
Examination and evaluation of tenders The contracting authority shall examine and evaluate the tenders available at the opening date.
It is required to determine the tender for the award of the contract that best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First, the suitability of the tenderers should be established.
Tenderers must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Participation in the procurement procedure should in principle be excluded from participation in the procurement procedure for companies which are legally convicted for, for example, bribery or fraud.
The tenders offered by the non-excluded tenderers shall be computerised, technically and economically examined and evaluated on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The contracting authority shall determine the most economically advantageous offer, and tenders with unusually low prices shall be specifically considered by the contracting authority.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly vulnerable phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders may be unjustifiedly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
The advantage or disadvantage of tenderers may inadmissibly affect the result of the evaluation and thus prevent the establishment of the most economically advantageous tender.
The contracting authority should therefore make special arrangements to ensure that the persons entrusted with the audit and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
In line with EU requirements, offers in both countries should be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the qualifications to be submitted by the undertakings and the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting shall be laid down in the notices or tender documents and shall not be amended during the procedure of the
After examining the suitability of the tender, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the tenders.
The evaluation should be limited to the award criteria.
The offers submitted must first be formally examined as soon as possible, whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, suggestions that might indicate possible manipulation intentions.
Where bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their bids, they shall be informed thereof without delay.
If the evaluation of the tenders results in an unreasonably low price, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment before possible exclusion of his tender.
The decisions taken in examining and evaluating the tenders shall be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Different arrangements
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing.
Only the contracting authority may carry out the review of the tenders and the calculation of the tenders.
It shall only employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further audit and evaluation tasks is not clearly regulated.
Where freelance workers are entrusted with auditing and evaluation, they must keep the offers confidential.
They may only make proposals for decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, procurement committees should be set up to examine and evaluate the tenders.
The Committees shall draw up evaluation reports with proposals for awarding contracts.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only contracting entities have to decide on contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for tendering in Germany are submitted incompletely, the contracting authority shall give the tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
It is only when the documents are still not available after the deadline that the offer should be excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or statements.
If a tenderer fails to do so, it must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers should also be examined.
If the price structure of the offer indicates that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the tenderer shall be required to remedy these uncertainties.
If it does not succeed and if the contracting authority can provide evidence of a mixed calculation of prices, this offer shall be excluded.
The aim is to prevent tenderers from speculating on substantial quantity changes in partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases in construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices of partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
A contract may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
Where one or more offers are below the actual price calculation of the contracting authority or the sum offered by the other tenderers by 10% or more, the tenderers shall prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are not able to do so, the contracting authority may exclude the tenders concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tendering procedure may be abolished after consideration of economic viability if only offers are available at unjustifiable low prices.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the award cannot be refused for offers with prices significantly higher than the calculation of the contracting authority.
Where there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority shall report without delay to the leading level of its technical supervision.
It must decide on the measures to be taken and whether to inform the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor.
For example, in the case of construction services above EUR 50 000, the supervisory authority must also agree when it is intended to award a contract free of charge, when it is not intended to award a contract at the lowest price or when the tender is to be abolished.
There are no such arrangements in the Czech Republic.
Main results of the audit
BRH
Appropriateness and evaluation criteria
The majority of the procurement procedures audited corresponded to those set out above.
For some firms proposed by professionals, contracting entities did not verify the suitability of the firms themselves.
A beneficiary commissioned undertakings without the required qualifications being fully presented.
In some cases it was not understandable whether the contracting authority took all the award criteria published into account in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "price" criterion.
Selection of participants and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting entities used unauthorised persons to examine the tenders.
For example, the staff of the department carried out tasks which were to be carried out only by the staff of the contracting authority, either freelance workers or those involved in the planning or execution of a construction project.
The building services justified this with insufficient staff capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, professionals who were responsible for examining the offers also participated in workers who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to carry out the contractual obligations in a conscientious manner.
In most cases, it was also incomprehensible for the building services whether the offers for the freelance workers were only accessible to persons directly entrusted with the processing.
Scrutiny and computerization of tenders
Some contracting entities handed over the open offers to professionals for further examination without having carried out the required review of the offers and the computerised examination itself and without having documented their results.
In the event of manipulative intentions, third parties would have been able to make changes to tenders without this being understandable for contracting entities.
The documents examined did not, or only lacked price or product information, indicate partially whether or not they were not sufficiently marked.
Cost-effectiveness tests
For a sample in a construction administration, the most favourable tenders for three-quarters of the procurement procedures audited depended more than 10% of the estimated costs previously identified.
Each twentieth award procedure has been abolished because of inadequate supply prices.
Not all tender examinations and information discussions with tenderers were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, there was a lack of clarity, such as the unit prices of the main positions.
Often, the deviations were only flat-rate, e.g. by reference to changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building services said that detecting and detecting mixed calculations was difficult.
In the case of a tender by an institution under public law, the tender price of the most favourable tender was 66% below the previously estimated value of these services.
Further calculation tests or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In an information discussion, the contracting authority did not find any evidence of the price dumping of the undertaking then commissioned.
Thus, it remained unclear whether the estimate was excessive or the supply price was too low.
Subsequently, the contracting authority assessed the contracted entity as a "cheap company," which could not hold quality or deadlines.
In the case of another tender, a construction agency awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
She did not cancel the call for tenders, giving a strange reason for the fact that it could be calculated on a detailed basis.
Suspicion of irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities in an audited construction administration, both of which were reported to the leading level of specialist supervision.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two tenderers was identical in a tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both tenders from the procedure.
The tests did not give rise to any substantial complaints as regards the application of the other rules.
Sao
Aptitude testing
For many of the projects audited, including higher education, road construction and the development of the railway network, contracting entities did not exclude tenderers from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents, or on the other hand, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had complied with the requirements.
Valuation
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority failed to take into account the criteria for assessing and evaluating the tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the development of the railway network, the contracting authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road conservation measures, a procedure misjudged the criterion of "shortening the construction phase."
This resulted in insufficient consideration being given to the shortening offered by second and third position bidders.

In three procurement procedures in the context of housing promotion, the contracting authority did not document what criteria it applied and on what basis it had selected the successful tenderer.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected companies for smaller orders up to €20,000 because of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions alone.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The arrangements for examining and evaluating offers in both countries comply with the EU's requirements.
However, as regards the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the rules differ from one another.
In Germany, detailed requirements, in particular regarding the implementation of the multi-eye principle and the protection of offers, regulate the process more strongly than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the benchmarks on the basis of which the adequacy of the offered prices should be assessed.
In both countries, some of the procurement procedures examined had to conclude that substantial procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or were insufficiently documented.
However, without traceability and transparency of audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions will be encouraged.
A particularly serious shortcoming was the handing over of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently scrutinised and documented the offers, thereby protecting them from possible manipulations in the subsequent procedure.
When contracting authorities perform tasks in assessing and evaluating offers by third parties, sufficient arrangements and an increased control burden are needed to counteract the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of prices, the services audited in Germany did not always make full use of the set of instruments and did not adequately analyse the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints were raised mainly concerning the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After examining and evaluating the tenders, the award procedure is concluded by awarding the contract or by abolishing the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
For EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers shall be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
Companies have the possibility to review the intended award of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or within 15 days for other means of communication and, where appropriate, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Where a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, the conclusion of a contract shall be possible only after the final decision has been taken in the review procedure.
Companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court in the course of this review procedure.
The purpose of the review procedure is to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the contracting authority to comply with the law of the contracting authority throughout the procurement procedure.
To this end, it must provide adequate documentation of the procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority must decide on the award of the contract.
It must not, however, deviate arbitrarily from the outcome of a proper examination and evaluation of the tenders.
The contracting authority shall award the contract within the announced deadline for awarding the contract,
Also because the tenderers are no longer bound by their offers after the expiry of the period.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited invitations to tender, the contracting authority shall in principle not deviate from the content of the tender when the contract is concluded.
The inferior tenderers shall be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking into account their tenders.
Procurement procedures may only be abolished under certain conditions, e.g. if the offer prices are excessive or if the offers do not comply with the requirements of the tender.
Different arrangements
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to provide information and waiting for 10 or 15 days before awarding the contract also applies to non-European construction services.
In Germany, these guidelines apply only to EU-wide public procurement.
In the case of the other procedures in Germany, the tenderers may not be informed of the award decision until they have been awarded the contract.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure should be abolished if only one tender has been received or if only one tender could be assessed.
In Germany, the award must also be awarded in the case of a single value-added offer, provided that it complies with the terms of the tender and is economical.
Main results of the audit
BRH
There were few complaints when the procurement procedures were completed in relation to the contracts audited.
In some cases, EU-wide contracts were awarded to companies prior to the expiry of the information deadlines, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In addition, letters of formal notice, following open procedures, contained, in individual cases, contents which deviate from the content of the offer, such as changed deadlines.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the second most favourable tender since a company with a 50% favourable tender after the contract period was no longer willing to carry out the services at the originally offered price.
Sao
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the tenderer's offer in terms of content.
In the case of certain contracts, such as road maintenance, motorway construction and bypass, contracting entities concluded contracts after the expiry of the statutory period.
When awarding construction works for the renovation of former military sites, the contracting authority only forwarded the award notification to all tenderers after the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU benchmarks for completing the award procedure.
The legal protection of the disadvantaged candidates or tenderers increases the range of anti-corruption tools.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to awards below EU thresholds.
In both countries, deadlines for the award of contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Building administrations should avoid the shortcomings identified when completing their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The procurement procedures shall be documented in each stage in terms of the relevant findings and the reasons for each decision.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.
The contract data will also be collected in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and anti-corruption Documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency offer.
A careful and timely documentation only allows for traceability of procurement decisions.
It also serves in particular to effectively protect tenderers from contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential element in preventing corruption, since the need to substantiate procurement decisions considerably provides room for manoeuvre.
The notification of a contract awarded under an EU-wide award procedure shall be sent by the contracting authority to the EU's Official Publications Office within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities shall also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report to the Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the Commission draws up an annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar arrangements
Both countries have fully transposed EU documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely identical in both countries.
Different arrangements
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide awards, but also covers other award procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide awards, publication obligations apply only to limited invitations to tender and to freelance contracts with a value limit of EUR 25 000 or EUR 15 000, respectively, without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition proceedings will be informed of the award of contracts.
Main results of the audit
BRH
Documentation
Many of the procurement procedures audited were not fully documented.
The contract notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product requirements or references to national regulatory frameworks.
In a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to an undertaking, although the tender did not contain any evidence to be submitted.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.
Notice on contract awards
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting entities failed to make the award of contracts known.
Other procurement procedures lacked proof that the contracting authorities had notified the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical summaries in question contained the minimum information required and were prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a construction administration did not publish these data because of a transmission error.
The building administration noticed this error only after half a year,
Thus, the procurement data of the previously completed procurement procedures have not been published.
Sao
Documentation
The documentation of the procurement procedures for the organisation of a major sporting event consisted of considerable shortcomings, mainly incorrect information such as incorrect offer prices in the evaluation commissions' records.
In addition, some of the opening protocols were not signed.
Notice on contract awards
For several road construction projects, notices of contracts were only published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are broadly consistent in both countries and implement EU standards.
The transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is guaranteed in principle.
The rules applicable to the notification in the Czech Republic go somewhat further than those in Germany.
The identified shortcomings in the documentation and notices considerably restricted the anti-orruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and procurement procedures and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the Sao and the BRH focused on two priorities, which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works by public contracting authorities: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law will allow cross-border competition to create a European single market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only designed to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two Courts of Auditors on the application of the rules governing public procurement in both countries and the comparison of those rules indicate similarities and differences for both countries in the further development of their procurement law and its application. use may be helpful.
Application of EU public procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's rules on the award of construction services into national law.
This provides an important common basis for the award of construction services in the Czech Republic and Germany, taking into account the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the parties and transparency of procurement procedures.
The construction administrations of both countries have partially very extensively supported these bids through further administrative provisions.
The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transposed the requirements for EU-wide construction services to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the audits carried out by the Courts have shown that the construction administrations have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to remedy the complaints identified when implementing EU requirements.
The checks carried out in the Czech Republic have identified in particular dangers which affect the cost-effectiveness of the contracts.
For example, incomplete service descriptions required additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation, and cost investigations were usually inadequate and excessive skills requirements were reduced. possible bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport buildings.
Prevention of corruption
The investigation did not aim to detect cases of corruption,
Also because the Courts of Auditors do not have the appropriate tools.
However, the Courts of Auditors may examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken steps against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction works and how these rules are applied.
In the prevention of corruption, both countries have put different priorities.
In particular, the German rules provide for largely unrestricted competition and transparency and controls as key elements in the prevention of corruption.
The main objective of the Czech legislation is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, the general principles of prevention of corruption apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the provisions on the award of construction works and are geared to their specific needs.
The corresponding arrangements set out in some cases very precisely how corruption prevention requirements should be taken into account when tendering procedures are conducted and when selecting the persons involved.
In particular, the fry considers that the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate instrument to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the award of construction services. the risk of manipulative interventions.
Risk analysis and adequate controls (in particular the multi-eyed principle), transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures, are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The fry therefore does not see a need for any fundamental changes to the corresponding provisions of the administrations concerning the award of works.
In practice, anti-corruption arrangements are largely taken into account.
The shortcomings identified in sub-sectors have identified shortcomings in the implementation of some benchmarks.
Construction administrations should continue to train their staff on anti-corruption requirements and raise their awareness of this issue.
A substantial part of the complaints concerned tasks delegated by construction administrations to professionals.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Manipulation and corruption-threatening tasks should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.
Sao
The Czech Republic has decided at government level to adopt a strategy against corruption in which public procurement is the main component.
The procurement law and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
Audits of the Sao were carried out during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legislative provisions should be effective improvement measures, as contracting entities are responsible for the cost-effectiveness of contracts, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria. and must justify the nature of the evaluations and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The Sao and the BRH consider the implementation of EU standards in principle positive.
The broad acceptance in practice has confirmed that EU offers of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects to facilitate and promote cross-border competition.
Given the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both Courts are calling on construction administrations in their countries to pursue their actions against corruption and manipulation and, if necessary, to improve them further. n.a.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be constantly examined to identify weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of construction services into lots may also have a favourable effect on supply prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient award of contracting authorities.
In Germany, the award procedures are carried out by the specialised construction administrations, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport construction projects, these tasks are carried out by the services themselves or by contractors entrusted to them.
The auditors of both countries are concerned to continue developing the relevant knowledge for each of them, even after the completion of their joint project, and, where appropriate, to bring it to their national parliament and government.
Both Courts are also convinced that the principles of procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles set out above are: insights and insights are of general importance to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
