Public procurement of works and Prevention of corruption
Joint report by the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of audit of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and Overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance for both the state and the economy.
It is the responsibility of the state to use public funds as economically and sparingly as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), contracting authorities ' award of services is an important element in the creation of a single Economic Area.
In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition, including cross-border, contracting authorities must comply with EU rules on the award of contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU member states have to transfer and apply EU procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to the individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The procurement of services is also a corruption-prone area.
In view of the generally high potential for damage, contracting authorities are therefore required to take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue advantages in the award of their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the federal Accounting Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits on both the EU-wide award of construction services and the Prevention of corruption.
The focus of the audits was on the application of the EU procurement law, each implemented in national regulations, as well as the Prevention of corruption in the procurement of construction services in building construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU threshold were also included in the consideration with regard to the Prevention of corruption.
The audit results of both sais are summarised in this joint report.
The report should also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organisation of supreme audit institutions (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited entities the evaluations of the Federal Court of auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross - sectional audits carried out in 2011/2012 at the building authorities responsible for the road construction and building construction of the federal government in Germany.
In doing so, he examined, for example, the construction of highways and major building projects.
In addition, the Bundesrechnungshof drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme control Office of the Czech Republic submitted its evaluations, audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The examinations included construction work in road construction, railway infrastructure construction, water engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the federal government's public procurement contracts are predominantly awarded by the building authorities of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies using state budgetary resources.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in certain areas of procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and in the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Structure of the public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sphere are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national procurement, many additional individual rules are laid down by internal administrative provisions,
such as the so-called" procurement manuals " of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in accordance with the law on procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and other statutory provisions, which apply to both the above and below the EU thresholds.
The procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new regulation reinforced transparency in the management of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in procurement procedures.
Principles of Public Procurement Law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure shall apply in particular to EU-wide awards.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold apply the National Procurement types (Public Procurement, restricted procurement, free-hand procurement), but which largely correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide procurement types.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the priority of the open procedure (in the case of EU-wide procurement) and the public procurement procedure (in the case of national procurement).
In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested undertaking may submit a tender.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
This is mainly due to the division of an overall construction measure into technical and partial lots.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above-mentioned features of German public procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable for construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure, where a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law provides, in accordance with EU law, for contracts to be concluded when competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic make it possible for contracting entities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros was accounted for by public construction (15%), which includes not only federal construction but also the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The federal government's construction volume in building construction and long-distance road construction (excluding railway infrastructures and hydraulic engineering) comprised 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction works in building construction and long-distance road construction in the Federal Republic of Germany was distributed among the types of contracts awarded in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public procurement, 12.7% restricted procedures and tendering, and 6.6% negotiated procedures and open contracts.
33.2% of these were pan-European Awards.
The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was 7.8 billion euros, which represented 37% of the total volume of construction.
Breakdown by type of contract for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public contracting entities in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant part of Public Procurement, which has a great financial impact on the Prevention of corruption to be observed in all procurement, and that the open procedure and public procurement are of outstanding importance for the award of contracts
Summary of the results of the parallel audits
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the federal Accounting Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) conducted parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and the Prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both sais compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
In doing so, they found essentially:
The EU directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the Prevention of corruption is also facilitated by the procurement rules of both countries, which partly differ in their priorities and their details (no 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the procurement documents is that they contain all the information necessary for the proper preparation of the tender.
The service descriptions must be neutral and must not contain any restrictions on competition.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a Problem to determine the subject-matter sufficiently.
In Germany, construction works must be divided into lots as far as possible in order to promote competition.
Following the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
The NKÚ noted in its road construction audits in particular that the award of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and pose the risk of price or other agreements.
In accordance with the provisions of both countries, contracting entities may, under certain conditions, agree on additional or modified services which are necessary after the initial contract has been concluded (no 4.1).
The respective specifications for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, Contracting entities may choose between open and restricted procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure applies to EU-wide contracts or the public invitation to tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts.
This allows more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, hinders price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction authorities generally awarded construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the calculation of costs for public buildings, particularly in building construction,
this is based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (no 4.2).
In the case of works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and notices must be published. The aim is to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned contracts at an early stage.
As a rule, the audited building authorities complied with this requirement.
In some cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (no 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of candidates invited shall be sufficient to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria shall be objective, shall not discriminate and shall be disclosed in advance.
In addition to EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should move as often as possible between the companies to be called up for selection.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are in some cases very detailed requirements in Germany.
In some cases, these requirements were not taken into account by the audited administrations.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (no 4.4).
In both countries, during the tendering phase, in order to ensure equal competition, the same information shall be provided to undertakings interested in submitting tenders.
In order to avoid anticompetitive agreements, it is necessary to avoid any contact between these companies and freelancers who have been involved in drawing up the specifications.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited building authorities in Germany did not comply with these requirements in part (no 4.5).
In both countries, the principle of extra expenditure and the principle of transparency must be taken into account when opening the offers.
The requirements for the identification, documentation, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers are intended to narrow the scope for manipulation and are particularly specified in Germany.
The tests in both countries revealed few objections (no 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by guidelines for the structure and process organisation.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting entities.
For example, contracting entities handed over offers to third parties for examination without prior examination of the offers and sufficient documentation of anomalies.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (no 4.7).
When the EU-wide procurement procedures are concluded, the parties to the competition will be informed of the proposed procurement.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corruption.
The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
In only a few cases, the contracting entities did not comply with the time limits laid down in the procurement procedures or did not comply with the tenderers ' offer in terms of content (no 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible at the audited building administrations in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide requirement for transparency was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notices of certain procedures.
Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (no 4.9).
Principles of EU procurement law and the Prevention of corruption
EU procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the procurement coordination directive and the remedies directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the member states.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, the competitive bid, the equal treatment bid or the Prohibition of discrimination and the transparency bid.
In order to achieve these objectives, the procurement coordination directive contains specific rules for construction work to be performed at EU level in the case of construction projects.
For this purpose, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed a current amount of 5,000,000 euros.
The regulations concern, in particular, documents the content of the Award, the publication of certain information before, during, and after the award, to Comply with deadlines, including for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the procurement procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of the applicants and The remedies Directive provides the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of the public procurement law, the undertakings concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives in national law.
The prevention of corruption
Importance of preventing corruption
In both countries there is no legal Definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a trust to a private advantage,
the i. d. R. will be initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.
In doing so, they have to review the organisation of their administrative structures and procedures for areas at risk of corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the susceptibility of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery, as well as acceptance and authorisation of benefits-is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the federal government has adopted a directive and recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi - eye principle and transparency, fundamental separation of Planning, Award and billing, accurate and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into public procurement legislation.
For example, the Federal Ministry responsible for public procurement in the federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system in 2011,
with the procurement data − such as the estimated costs and the order amounts-as well as information about the persons involved in the professional activity are collected and evaluated for anomalies.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements for transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the Prohibition of any discrimination, constitute the most important basis for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has adopted anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on combating corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in this directive have already been transposed into National Public Procurement Law and related administrative provisions by 14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are: reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts; obligation to prior publicise the award of contracts by the contracting entity, including indication of the grounds for tendering; Prohibition of the restriction of the number of tenderers in restricted procedures, thereby abolishing the possibility of selecting tenderers through lot procedures; introduction of the obligation to publish the procurement documents and all annexes; introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results for each phase of the procurement procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents the procurement documents must contain all the information the tenderers need to produce an appropriate tender.
In particular, the procurement documents must allow a suitable calculation.
In doing so, tenderers must not be exposed to risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The procurement documents consist in particular of the specifications and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proof of the tenderers ' qualification (suitability) and the criteria which determine the selection of the most cost-effective offer.
Requirements of EU law and the Prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are directed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all tenderers and should limit competition as little as possible.
The specifications must always be product-neutral.
For this reason, information on products or manufacturers as part of the specifications is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding competitive constraints in procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents must be avoided, as they provide scope for speculations in the preparation of the offers and for manipulations in their evaluation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules in both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications are transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be written off in a product-neutral manner without factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must normally be subdivided into service units with respective quantity specifications in detail.
Prices must be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m2 or per unit).
Only in exceptional cases can Services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the specifications must be complete and unambiguous.
They shall contain precise quantities and shall not include services for which it is not determined whether they are needed.
Remuneration according to flat rates or according to time expenditure shall be avoided as far as possible.
The purpose of these provisions is to prevent speculation and manipulation based on undetermined specifications in the procurement documents.
The service descriptions must enable tenderers to produce their services safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender shall not be made public until the procurement documents have been completed.
Different rules
There is no obligation to tender works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible by the nature of the service to be performed, the public contracting authorities may subdivide the works into several lots.
In Germany, construction works are generally to be divided into lots, separated by the quantity (partial lots) and / or by type or subject area (specialised lots).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical as a rule.
Evaluation criteria must be specified in the procurement documents in the Czech Republic both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
The aim is to ensure that applicants are fully and finally able to identify the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria is required in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, only in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national award procedures, the evaluation criteria shall only be recorded in an internal administrative award notice.
In Germany, procurement documents drawn up by authorised freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or reviewers in the building construction and some road construction administrations.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the knowledge of the customer.
This is also the reason why freelance procurement documents are not allowed to send or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the company is the customer alone.
There is currently no provision in the Czech Republic for this.
Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always incurred for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the awarding of supplements to the company that has already been appointed, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without major disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to such contracts without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need for an additional contractor to participate in the already ongoing construction work.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the company that has already been commissioned, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed are to be assumed.
In addition to supplementary benefits, there may also be a reduction in the scope of benefits.
In the Czech Republic, lower volumes cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.
Key Audit Findings
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In some cases, the specifications included references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some service descriptions also included product-related specifications – for example, graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection plates-without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described in such detail that only one product was considered.
Subdivided by services
The BRH has not found in any of the proceedings examined violations of the command to write out services in a list of services broken down by partial services.
Completeness of service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tendering procedures.
In some cases, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some items or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the service directories contained items where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A service schedule for demolition work even consisted almost half of such demand items.
Lots and evaluation criteria
In the case of many awards, there was no prescribed justification for the fact that the services, which were mainly offered by non-specialists, were not further divided into non-specialists.
There were no objections when specifying the criteria to be used for the evaluation of tenders.
References to freelancers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the persons involved in freelance work.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or expert opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of tendering".
In the building sector in particular, the contracting authorities mainly attributed the objections raised to failures of the freelancers responsible for drawing up the service descriptions.
The Construction Services pointed to the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately monitor the specifications.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units were specified in the performance description a supplier as well as a particular brand of product.
The contracting entity did not allow the use of comparable products without justification.
During the construction of several higher education buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the invitation to tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting entity did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the specifications.
As a power unit, it merely indicated the space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of service descriptions
In the construction of a motorway bypass, the specifications were modified four times during the period August to September 2009 as part of a non-open procedure,
as the volume of services increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for Social buildings included inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary structural studies and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services.
When building a large library building, the specifications of the Interior did not contain any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these lack of specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriate high-quality equipment.
Lots and selection criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction work into partial lots or the award of partial lots is not compulsory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts were allocated in lots, savings of up to € 31.6 million would have been possible with a total cost of € 620.3 million.
For example, six different buildings which were the subject of a single contract alone would have saved EUR 2.5 million (25 %) if they were awarded in lots.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be allocated separately, savings of EUR 11.5 million (25 %) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
In the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority set very extensive reference requirements as the selection criteria.
In the construction of a part of a motorway, the contracting entity requested the tenderers, in an open procedure, to prove, among other things, at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth EUR 28 million from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another part of a motorway included six separate construction projects for which the contracting entity had set an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million for the last three years as the criterion for the selection of the undertakings.
Two-thirds of the appropriations allocated to road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. EUR 2.5 billion out of a total of EUR 3.7 billion) were allocated to contracts awarded by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
For 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even one bidder made an offer.
The NKÚ showed that narrowing the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional Services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the legal procedures in two cases when additional services were awarded, nor did it conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, additional revenues were generated in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to EUR 165.4 million (net), resulting in an increase in the respective order volume of 21% and 91% respectively.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
In the case of several higher education buildings, some of the services were not included in the procurement documents, although their need for the award of the contract was already known.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the national procurement law threshold of 20 % of the original contract value, the Contracting authority with the representative firm, negotiated procedures without a contract notice.
In the case of the construction of a large Court building, the contracting authority retained the right to award additional works in negotiated procedures without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of work by EUR 2 million.
The unit prices for the non-competitive additional construction services were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further Findings
On the basis of a sample audit of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane highway kilo-meters in the Czech Republic amounted to 14.6 million euros.
In Germany, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre, on the other hand, amounts to up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary Findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and prevent corruption.
For example, the requirement for sufficient determination of the service descriptions is intended to enable tenderers to properly calculate and produce their offers,
protect the customer from additional services to be agreed at a later date and also contain scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for procurement documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and manipulation possibilities.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is enhanced by the publication of the evaluation criteria for non-EU award procedures.
The specifications have been met to a large extent in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected, which could also have led to restrictions of competition.
In Germany, the existing bid for the formation of Lots promotes competition and leads to economic outcomes.
In the Czech Republic, according to the examination findings of the NKÚ, the awarding of large services without lots or with only very large lots of restrictions on the supplier field can result in only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements laid down in the Czech Republic in road construction have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to participate in the competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.
In the case of the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, supplementary services with a value up to half of the main contract can be awarded without public procurement under certain conditions.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, up to which additional services can be awarded without notice to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
This limit is often exceeded,
as the scope of services for public procurement is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess is greater than 20 %, the additional benefits must be announced by public announcement.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting negative consequences can be avoided.
Specify the type of award and take into account the EU threshold
By defining the type of award, the contracting authority determines the size of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It may leave the range of potential candidates and tenderers largely Unlimited, for example by selecting an open procedure, or by specifying non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, European-wide procurement procedures shall be applied.
Requirements of EU law and the Prevention of corruption
When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority shall take into account, in particular, the competition and transparency requirements of European law.
If the estimated total contract value of the works of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the works are generally to be awarded in Europe by open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may, in the case of works which reach or exceed the EU threshold, derogate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European Procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of each lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reasons or deliberately estimated at low cost values in order to avoid the obligation to generally award construction services across Europe.
As competition restrictions significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the award type becomes very important in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the type of award chosen and the examination of the obligation to apply EU procurement rules are important components of the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU procurement and threshold requirements into national law.
Different rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle of equal treatment of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non - open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or substantiated. However, other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or, in the case of national awards, the public invitation to tender generally takes precedence. This is laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the anti - corruption guidelines.
Other types of procurement – such as the restricted procedure or restricted tendering − are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the procurement law.
The existence of an exception must be clearly justified and documented.
The principle of the priority of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender is intended to ensure as unlimited competition as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by setting it on specific tenderers and to make possible price agreements between tenderers more difficult.
The principle of public procurement is a central Element in preventing corruption in Germany.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organisations to determine the expected costs in the field of Public Building Construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost indicators for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected order value of a planned forecast or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have in Germany only some construction administrations.
However, a nationwide introduction is planned for all road authorities.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic are not able to use central databases or average price calculations of comparable construction measures to determine the expected cost of construction work.
In most cases, cost calculations are based on estimates made by the financing body or on the amount of funds made available to the building service.
Measures to standardize cost determination procedures are still in the early stages.
Within the framework of the Anti - Corruption Plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.

The purpose of this database is to collect information on the cost of materials and construction and construction works, as well as other cost - relevant data, in order to enable cost calculations and provisions of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control,
this is intended to serve as a benchmark for the price setting in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key audit findings BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The contracting entities audited largely wrote out the works in open procedures or in public procurement procedures, thus following the budgetary and public procurement rules.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services in building construction were put out to public or open tender.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
In the choice of non-public procurement types, detailed reasons were partly missing, why the contracting entities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public invitation to tender.
In a cross-cutting investigation, the BRH concluded, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that the non - public procurement types have significant competitive disadvantages compared to the open procedures and public procurement procedures and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the building sector, more than twice as many bids were submitted for Public Procurement As for restricted tenders and almost three times as many bids as for free-hand contracts.
The investigation also showed that, on average, bid prices were 6% and 10% higher for restricted tenders and open-ended tenders than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of construction and a state court of audit confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement types.
The Federal Ministry of construction, as a result of its studies on economic efficiency, even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of construction projects for which they had identified an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 Euro, the contracting entities audited generally drew up procurement plans in which they determined the works to be awarded by EU-wide as well as by national procurement procedures.
According to the public procurement plans, this has meant that more than 80% of the EU-wide construction work has always been allocated.
It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award EU-wide contracts by means of too low cost estimates.
However, in part as a result of incorrect calculations, there was a de facto fall below the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures.
During the construction phase, some contracting entities improperly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not substantiate these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures was still being complied with.
For most of the construction measures under review, the proportion of EU subcontracting according to the accounting results was usually lower than that foreseen under the procurement plan.
In some cases, contracting entities in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold do not comply with the requirement to write out all single lots of EUR 1,000,000 and more in EU-wide procedures,
and instead chose national procedures.
NKÚ
Choice of the award procedure
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing construction projects, the contracting sites divided construction work into several sub-orders, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these splits, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated value of the contract
In road construction, existing price databases for this sector were insufficient to determine the expected value of the contract.
The data was based on recently completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional services or excessive profits of the commissioned companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than the expected order values established by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on investor estimates.
The actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice the value of the contract agreed at a later stage, but eight additions resulting from the construction work resulted in a cost increase of EUR 2.1 million and 27% respectively.
Similarly, the actual value of the contract for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases during the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. In the case of the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had only expanded by 12%.
Summary Findings
Both countries have transposed the EU rules on the award of contracts and the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line.
The current priority of the open procedure or Public invitation to tender, however, goes beyond the requirements of the EU and in the Czech Republic regulations.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, public procurement procedures or public procurement procedures offer more companies the opportunity to participate in competition.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of Offers and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not limiting the field of candidates by client specifications that are susceptible to manipulation and by making price agreements between bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender in Germany.
Under Czech law, contracting entities may award contracts in open or restricted procedures.
According to the most recent changes in public procurement law, the number of tenderers may no longer be restricted in cases involving prior competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting entities have largely followed the guidelines on the priority of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been allocated inadmissibly in order to avoid the requirements for the choice of the type of contract.
Taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a fall below the minimum share of services offered throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected cost of works and construction projects.
Building administrations should ensure, where appropriate, through further controls, that the requirements for the choice of the type of contract and the scope of services to be written out across the EU are met or that the conditions for appropriate cost investigations are created.
Prior information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public client must inform interested companies about the planned Awards in advance of the invitation to tender.
Preliminary information and notices form an important basis for pan-European competition.
Requirements of EU law and the Prevention of corruption
The preliminary information shall contain the essential information relating to the construction projects envisaged under public procurement law.
They are necessary for those construction projects where the total estimated value of the contract reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting entity intends to reduce the time-limits for open or restricted procedures.
In notices, the contracting authority shall specify binding details of the works contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
It shall make known, inter alia, the scope of services, the procedural and execution dates, the specific requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the subject of the contract, the common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV Codes), which is standardised throughout Europe, must be used.
Preliminary information and notices shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the contracting authority.
In order to prevent any discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices may not contain additional information at national level and may only be issued after sending the notice to the office for official publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may interfere with competition and may even support manipulation.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The EU legal requirements for prior information and Publicity have been fully transposed into national law by both countries.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, prior information and notices must also be published in the case of works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may be started at the earliest one month after dispatch of the prior information notice to the EU official journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the National Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a prior information notice be waived.
In Germany, no pre-information is required for non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public procurement and participation competitions must be published on the federal internet portal and, where applicable, also in newspapers or periodicals, prior to restricted tendering.
In the case of restricted calls for tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded starting at 25,000 euros are required (Ex ante transparency).
The preliminary information shall include all planned lots of the construction projects.
In Germany,this is of particular importance because of the small proportion of loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, this rule has only a small effect, since there much less construction work is divided into lots.
Key Audit Findings
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting entities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with works to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they reduced the time limit for the submission of tenders, although the 52-day deadline required between the submission of the preliminary information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of validity of the prior information notice had expired and before it had been extended.
For many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned division of the works into lots.
Notice
The notices of the audited entities contained partial CPV Codes which differed from the information provided in the prior information or which did not properly cover the required services.
In some cases, notices were published earlier at national level or included more information – for example, on the deadlines for implementation – than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex ante transparency
The contracting entities of an audited building administration had entrusted a service undertaking with publishing the national procurement procedures.
This published the reports on its own fee-based award platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the notifications to the Federal free internet portal as required.
Samples showed that only one-third of the reports from the audited administration were published on this Portal.
NKÚ
Notice
When constructing a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the tenderers.
The contracting entity was unable to demonstrate how the tenderers were selected.
The restriction of the number of tenderers was permitted under the law in force at that time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting entity did not specify in the contract notice or in the documentation of the contract procedure, in the case of an restricted procedure, the purpose of which was to assess the candidates ' qualifications and the number of candidates who wished to allow them to compete.
The contracting entity concluded in its assessment that all six candidates complied with the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst evaluations from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting entity was not transparent because it had not provided information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time during the procedure.
Publication of notices
When renovating former military grounds, the contracting entity did not publish the tender.
Summary Findings
The two-stage Information System with prior information and publicity is an important component in order to implement the transparency requirement in Europe-wide procurement, to strengthen competition and thus prevent corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public procurement
In contrast to public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures do not allow any undertaking interested in the performance of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting entity shall select in advance which undertakings are to be invited to submit tenders.
Requirements of EU Law and of corruption prevention EU regulations do not allow a limitation on the number of Applicants in the EU-wide public procurement procedure.
However, in the case of restricted procedures, at least five undertakings shall be invited to submit tenders.
For negotiated procedures with a contract notice, at least three undertakings shall be invited.
In any case, the number of candidates invited shall be sufficient to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed in advance.
The selection of companies to be called upon is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be preferred unilaterally.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.
In both cases, the distribution result may be significantly affected at the expense of the customer.
The contracting entities shall therefore take special measures to prevent possible manipulation, to carry out adequate controls and, in particular, to ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The arrangements for the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to EU requirements, contracting entities should switch among the companies to be called upon as often as possible in the selection of candidates.
Nor should Competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.
The contracting entities shall justify the selection of candidates and document the course of the selection procedure in their award notices.
Different rules
In Germany, at least three candidates must be invited to submit tenders in the case of restricted calls for tenders and, in the case of free-hand tenders, in principle, several suitable candidates must be invited to submit tenders.
Under the new Czech rules, it is inadmissible − with the exception of two special areas-to limit the number of tenderers in the case of restricted procedures and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, a staff member has proposed a number of companies for a public procurement procedure, the management level of construction services or an agent of the awarding authority of this proposal in the rule change by taking out about a proposed business and/ or a new business Supplement.
The aim is to prevent a single Person from finally determining the group of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could enable far-reaching agreements to be reached between the parties.
The list of companies to be called upon must be kept confidential and not made available to the general public, even in respect of freelancers.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be called upon, but can only submit proposals to the contracting entity.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.
Key Audit Findings
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of undertakings to submit tenders in the case of non-public procurement was met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures of construction services in building construction revealed that the contracting authorities requested an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids for limited federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies to submit bids for free tender.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with a few suppliers, the contracting entities did not always change the range of candidates selected.
In particular, they took into account companies already known and tried and tested from their point of view.
As a result, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the undertakings to be called upon to compete prior to the invitation to tender.
The BRH did not identify an inadmissible restriction to regional tenderers in the case of non-public procurement procedures, but it did identify a higher proportion of regional-based undertakings than in the case of public procurement procedures.
This was mainly due to the fact that the scope of services for non-public procurement procedures was on average much lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes were more important than for public procurement procedures.
More-eyes-principle and proposals freelance
Contrary to the rules, contracting entities mainly failed to have the proposed list of entities to be called upon modified by an independent Person.
In particular, they justified this with lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
In many cases, it was not documented who had proposed the companies invited to submit the tender.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the candidate lists and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting entities.
Thus, the contracting entities did not protect themselves to the extent required from possible manipulations.
Confidentiality of bidders ' lists
At a contracting entity, the lists of companies to be called up were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all staff members of that entity.
In the event of manipulative intentions, the names of the proposed or approved companies could have been passed on without authorisation and, for example, could have enabled agreements to be made between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the procedures contained only in a few cases, justifications for the selection of candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of candidates
When building a motorway ring, tenderers were not given information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of restricted procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In a single procedure, all eight participants met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The procurement committee then carried out a lot procedure for the selection of companies.
However, this procedure, which was in principle acceptable at that time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary Findings
Because of the high danger of Manipulation in the selection of candidates in public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special measures to prevent undue restrictions of competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secrecy of the bidders ' lists and the exclusive power of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be called upon, the German provisions restrict such opportunities for abuse.
In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced specification of the largely unlimited number of bidders for non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been insufficiently implemented and that the potential for tampering with the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
Contracting authorities should eliminate all the deficiencies identified.
Offer phase
The contract award notice or the invitation to tender shall commence at the stage of the tendering process in which undertakings may draw up tenders on the basis of the procurement documents sent to them.
Candidates may submit their tenders until the deadline set by the contracting entity.
Requirements of EU law and the Prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.
Contracting entities shall comply with the national rules designed to counteract the possibilities of manipulation existing during the offer phase.
These are mainly organizational requirements and controls.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The procurement documents on the basis of which the undertakings are to draw up their offers shall, in principle, only be sent by the contracting entity.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure shall not carry out this task.
The contracting entity shall ensure that all candidates receive the same information during the tendering phase.
In the event of ambiguity in the procurement documents or other questions concerning the tendering procedure, only the contracting entity may provide information to the candidates.
Freelancers engaged in the preparation of the procurement documents may not provide any information.
During the entire offer period, contact between the appointed freelancers and the candidates must be prevented.
The freelancers must not become a hub of the procurement procedure through which contacts can be established with anticompetitive effects.
Tenders sent by Post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Offers sent electronically shall be subject to technical encryption.
Different rules
In Germany, the contracting authority may also order external service providers to print and send the procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to fulfil the contractual obligations conscientiously.
In Germany, the offers received must be marked with an entry stamp and sent directly, without delay and unopened to a member of staff responsible for safekeeping.
This staff member shall not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be closed by the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a reference number.
The contracting entity shall keep the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt data in a protocol.
The storage of offers is not specified in detail in the Czech Republic.
Key Audit Findings
BRH
The tests for the supply phase focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building construction administration.
Dispatch of procurement documents
The contracting authorities of the audited Building Construction Administration sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send out procurement documents.
Information to candidates
The audited building construction administration did not comply with the requirements for separation of planning and allocation when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
Contrary to the specifications, it did not specify employees from the contracting authority in the service descriptions, but from the project management as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even included the names of the freelancers who had produced the specifications.
In some cases, not all applicants received the same information in case of requests during the offer phase.
Identification of offers
In the case of the audited Building Construction Administration, all received offers were marked with the entry stamp and the entry notice.
However, in the case of some freely - handed contracts, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the claims to prevent corruption.
Keep the offers
Following their identification, not all tenders were sent directly and without delay to the staff responsible for safekeeping, who included the tenders in a steel cabinet.
In a building service, the offers had meanwhile been placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which each staff member had access.
Another department had suspended a mailbox in a corridor not constantly monitored, in which the offers introduced there remained partly even overnight.
Since the insertion slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only staff, but also visitors to the service had the opportunity to remove received offers and possibly to manipulate.
NKÚ
On the Czech side, no defects were objected to.
Summary Findings
In particular, during the tendering phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the award procedure should be avoided in both countries.
By providing the same information to all tenderers, the principle of equal treatment should also be upheld.
The regulations on receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers appear suitable to counter Manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be addressed with little effort.
Opening of tenders
Opening of tenders
During the opening date of the previously-sealed tenders will be opened and their contents read out, and thus made known.
From the opening date, tenderers shall be bound by their tenders until the end of the time limit set by the contracting entity.
Requirements of EU law and the Prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal rules for the opening up of offers.
However, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive provisions for the protection of offers and competition during this highly sensitive Phase of the procurement procedure.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the Offer Opening are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
The opening date shall be carried out by several persons to be designated by the contracting authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from uncontrolled manipulation of the offers when opening the offers.
In most procurement procedures, tenderers may participate in the opening date.
Only tenders submitted to the negotiator when the first tender was opened are eligible for opening.
Offers received late May no longer be considered.
The transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the offer opening in a log, including the names of the tenderers and the tender prices shall be recorded.
The protocol shall be read out and signed by the negotiating committee.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee shall open tenders.
It can also involve freelancers.
The committee may also be entrusted with further stages of the procurement procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a head of negotiation and a secretary shall open the tender.
The head of the negotiation shall be an official of the issuing body.
The head of the negotiation and, in the case of contracts in building construction, the Secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the contract documents or in the award and contract execution.
According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features − such as damaged or delayed offers − must be recorded in the minutes of the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's right to sign are recorded.
The German regulations provide that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are generally characterized by perforations with the date of the opening date. They shall be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for the processing.
There are no corresponding Czech regulations.
If only one tender is received in a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, this must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is entered here, it must be opened and then valued.
Key Audit Findings
BRH
More-Eyes-Principle
The audited contracting entities implemented the requirements for the additional expenditure principle at the opening dates.
They carried out the opening dates each with negotiators and accountants who were not tasked with any other contract negotiations.
However, in the case of contracts awarded on a voluntary basis with a lower scope of services, there were isolated cases in which freelancers sent to them opened offers without the participation of the contracting authority.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late submitted offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Identification of offers
The contracting authorities examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination identified the tenders according to the specifications by perforating them with the date of the opening date.
In the case of a number of beneficiaries who had been in the past for some time, insufficient labelling was found.
However, these contracting entities changed their labelling practice following the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was not received by the contracting authority until one month after the end of the tendering period. The Contracting entity accepted the offer nevertheless.
Summary Findings
The rules of both countries for the opening-up of tenders are in substantial parts identical. They take into account both the additional expenditure principle and the transparency principle. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of offers can be substantially limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure as well as for labelling, safe storage and confidentiality of offers significantly restrict manipulation options such as subsequent changes to offers.
In addition, the persons responsible for the opening of the offers shall not carry out any other tasks in connection with the service to be rendered.
All in all, only a few complaints prove the high acceptance of the specifications for the opening of the offer.
Examination and evaluation of tenders
Examination and evaluation of offers the client shall examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
It shall determine the offer for the award of the contract which best meets the requirements according to the given award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the Prevention of corruption
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-level procedure:
First, the suitability of the tenderers must be determined.
Tenderers must be economically and financially viable and possess the necessary professional and technical expertise.
In principle, companies that have been convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must be excluded from participating in the procurement procedure.
The tenders of the non-excluded tenderers shall be examined in terms of calculation, technical and economic terms and shall be assessed on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client shall determine the most economically advantageous tender. Tenders with abnormally low prices must be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the tenders is a phase of the award procedure that is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
For example, tenderers may be excluded unjustifiably or tenders which do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
By favouring or discriminating bidders, the score can be unduly affected and thus the finding of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting entity shall therefore take special measures to ensure that the persons responsible for verification and evaluation fulfil the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It shall also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
In line with the requirements of the EU, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-level procedures.
The requirements relating to the suitability of undertakings to be submitted, the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the procurement documents and cannot be modified during the procedure.
Once the suitability of the tender has been verified, the selection criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the tenders.
The evaluation shall be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be examined formally as soon as possible to determine whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, anomalies that could indicate potential manipulation intentions.
If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they shall be informed thereof immediately.
If the evaluation of the tenders results in an abnormally low price, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his tender.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Different rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly responsible for the processing.
The examination of the offers and the calculation of the offers may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It shall enter only staff who are not concerned with the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of the other audit and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting entities.
In the Czech Republic, contracting committees shall be set up for the purpose of examining and evaluating tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If the documents or declarations required for submission of tenders in Germany are only partially submitted, the contracting entity shall give the tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting entity whether it gives tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do so, it must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the standard prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there is evidence of prices being set too low or too high for partial services, the Bidder shall be asked to clear up these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and the contracting entity can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer shall be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases in the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
No contract may be awarded in Germany for offers with excessively high or low prices.
If one or more offers fall short of the applicable price determination of the customer or the offer totals of the other tenderers by 10% or more, the tenderers must prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If you are unable to do so, the contracting entity may exclude the offers concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the invitation to tender may be cancelled after verification of economic viability if only tenders with unjustifiable low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the contract cannot be denied for this reason for offers with prices substantially higher than the customer's calculation.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its level of specialist supervision.
The latter shall decide on the measures to be taken and whether the Antitrust Authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
The expert Supervisory level must agree to, for example, also for works over 50,000 Euro, if private contracts, a surcharge not to the tender with the lowest price, or by tender shall be cancelled.
There are no regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key Audit Findings
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the procurement procedures examined complied with the requirements set out above.
In the case of some proposed firms, the contracting entities did not themselves verify the suitability of the firms.
A recipient of the grant contracted companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the contracting entity would take into account all the award criteria disclosed in its selection decision or whether it had merely used the 'price' criterion for its award decision.
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting entities used unapproved persons when examining the tenders.
For example, freelancers or staff members of the service responsible for planning or carrying out a construction project carried out tasks which were to be carried out only by staff of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, employees who were not obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the offers and to fulfil the contractual obligations conscientiously were also involved in the freelance work involved in the examination of the offers.
For the construction services, it was usually not clear whether the offers were available to the freelancers only to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Review and calculation of offers
Some contracting entities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and their results documented.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting entities.
In the documents examined, anomalies or missing price or product information were partially not or only insufficiently marked.
Performance audits
In the case of a sample in a building construction administration, the most favourable tenders for three quarters of the procurement procedures examined exceeded 10% of the estimated costs previously assessed.
Every twentieth award procedure was cancelled because of inappropriate offer prices.
Not all offer examinations and Information talks with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed information was missing, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
In many cases, the deviations were only flat-rate, e.g. due to indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services stated that it was difficult to detect and prove mixed calculations.
In the event of an invitation to tender from an institution governed by public law, the offer price of the most favourable offer was 66% lower than the previously estimated value of these services.
Detailed calculations or investigations of the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In an information interview, the contracting entity did not find any evidence of price dumping by the then-appointed company.
Thus, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the commissioned company as a" low-cost company", which could neither maintain quality nor deadlines.
In the case of another call for tenders, a building service agency awarded the contract for a tender the price of which was 35% higher than the cost calculation value.
She did not cancel the invitation to tender and stated the non-factual reason that this company could be concluded on an adequate calculation.
Suspected irregularities
In the case of an audited building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the Supervisory Authority.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two tenderers was identical in the case of an invitation to tender, so that the contracting entity excluded both tenders from the procedure.
In the application of the other regulations, the examinations did not give rise to any significant objections.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
In many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and rail network expansion, the contracting entities did not exclude tenderers from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or were unable to prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting entity could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had fulfilled the requirements.
Rating
When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the contracting entity did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria in the examination and evaluation of the tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the contracting entity did not determine the weighting of the evaluation criteria until the start of the evaluation.
In the case of road conservation measures, the specified criterion "shortening of the construction phase" was wrongly evaluated.
As a result, the proposed reduction in the number of bidders in the second and third positions was insufficiently taken into account.
Documentation of the selection
In the case of three award procedures for the promotion of housing, the contracting entity did not document the criteria it applied and the basis on which it selected the successful tenderer.
In the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys at prices and delivery conditions.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the interviews were not documented.
Summary Findings
The rules governing the examination and evaluation of offers correspond to the requirements of the EU in both countries.
For details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved in the respective regulations, but deviate from each other.
In Germany, detailed requirements in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and the protection of offers make the procedure more regulated than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the appropriateness of the offered prices is to be examined.
In both countries, some of the procurement procedures examined had to be found to have not or only insufficiently documented significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders.
However, possible manipulative interventions are favoured without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions.
A particularly serious defect was the handover of all tenders to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently examined and documented the tenders and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
Where contracting authorities have tasks for the examination and evaluation of tenders carried out by third parties, sufficient precautions and increased control are necessary to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When examining the appropriateness of prices, the services audited in Germany did not always make full use of the set tools and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, objections were raised in particular during the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the procurement procedure
After examination and evaluation of the tenders, the award procedure shall be completed by the award of the contract or by the repeal of the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the Prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the proposed procurement decision.
Companies have the option of examining the intended award in the event of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or in the case of other means of communication within 15 days and, where appropriate, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this period of information.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
If a tenderer submits a request for review within the Information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure shall ensure the legal protection of the undertakings and shall encourage the contracting entity to comply with the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.
For this purpose, the procedure must be documented sufficiently.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting entity shall decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The contracting authority shall issue the order within the specified time limit,
also because the tenderers are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and restricted procedures or public and restricted tenders, the contracting entity may not deviate from the content of the tender when concluding the contract.
The unsuccessful tenderers shall be informed in a timely manner of the award decision and of the reasons why their tenders are not taken into account.
Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. where the bid prices are excessive or the tenders do not meet the requirements of the invitation to tender.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, the 10-and 15 - day obligation to provide information and to wait for bids also applies to construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany,these requirements only apply to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of other proceedings in Germany, tenderers can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be cancelled if only one tender has been received or only one tender could be assessed.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only a single tender, provided that it meets the conditions of the invitation to tender and is economic.
Key Audit Findings
BRH
In the case of the contracts under examination, there were only in a few cases objections when the procurement procedures were concluded.
In some cases, EU-wide contracts have already been awarded to companies before the end of the information deadlines, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In individual cases, Order letters according to open procedures also contained content that differs from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, contracting entities did not comply with the time limits for the award of contracts.
In an open procedure, therefore, a contracting entity awarded the contract to the second lowest bid, since a company with a 50% more favourable offer was no longer prepared to perform the services at the price originally offered after the end of the contract period.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority in the contract deviated from the bidder's offer.
In the case of some contracts, for example in the case of road maintenance works, construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting entities concluded the contracts after the end of the statutory period.
When awarding construction works for the renovation of former military grounds, the contracting authority did not transmit the notification of the award until after the end of the legal period to all tenderers.
Summary Findings
Both countries have implemented EU requirements to complete the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of unsuccessful candidates or tenderers increases the range of tools for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
The building authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting requirements
The award procedures shall be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages in view of the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
For EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.
Order data is also collected in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the Prevention of corruption documentation of procurement procedures is a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and timely documentation allows for the traceability of procurement decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for tenderers in the case of contracts awarded above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to substantiate procurement decisions in detail, considerably restricts the scope for manipulation.
The contract notice for an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent to the office for official publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, thus also implementing the transparency requirement.
Contracting entities shall also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report to the EU Commission through the relevant national ministries.
The European Commission, on this basis, an annual EU statistics, an Overview of the development of the internal market for construction services.
Rules of German and Czech public procurement law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The documentation and reporting arrangements for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide procurement, but also covers the other procurement procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany there is a publication requirement only in case of Restricted tenders, and direct Awards with a value from the value limits of 25,000 Euro and 15,000 Euro without VAT (so-called Ex-post transparency), alongside EU-wide bids.
Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition proceedings receive information on the award of contracts.
Key Audit Findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the procurement procedures audited were not fully documented.
The procurement notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as to justify product specifications or to refer to national rules.
In the case of a procurement procedure, the contracting entity did not substantiate why it awarded the contract to an undertaking, even though its offer had not included mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting entities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Contract award notices
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting entities failed to disclose the award of contracts.
In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting entities had made known the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting requirements
The statistical records examined contained the minimum information required. They were prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post Transparency
In most cases, the audited building management authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, in the case of a building management, this data was not published due to a transmission error.
The administration noticed this error only after half a year,
this means that the contract data of the procurement procedures that have been completed have not been published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction work for the organisation of a large sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures showed considerable shortcomings. This was mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the valuation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the opening of the offer were not signed.
Contract award notices
In the case of several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were only published late or not at all.
Summary Findings
The documentation and reporting requirements are largely in line in both countries and implement EU requirements.
The transparency of procurement procedures, including procurement procedures, is ensured in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the regulations in Germany.
The shortcomings in the documentation and in the notices indicated significantly limited the orruption-preventing effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
Building administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and procurement procedures and fully comply with their reporting and reporting requirements.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two main issues, which are in the Czech Republic and in Germany, essential for the award of construction contracts by Contracting authorities: the application of The EU procurement rules and the prevention of Corruption.
The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a European internal market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only used to prevent or at least reduce corruption. You should also avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two sais on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, and the comparison of these rules, reveal similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement rules
The requirements of the EU for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of works and the consideration of the essential bids of competition, equal treatment of the undertakings involved and the transparency of the procurement procedures.
The building authorities of both countries have in some cases supported these bids very extensively by further administrative provisions.
The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements for EU-wide construction services to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the court of auditors ' investigations have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to remedy the identified objections when implementing the EU requirements.
In particular, the tests in the Czech Republic have shown dangers which affect the economic viability of the contracts.
Thus, incomplete specifications required additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, the cost investigations were usually insufficiently prepared. Also, the number of potential tenderers was reduced by excessive skill requirements and competition was restricted, in particular in the case of transport structures.
The prevention of corruption
The investigations did not aim to detect corruption cases,
also because the sais do not have the appropriate tools to do so.
However, the sais can assess the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and Manipulation in the awarding of works and how these provisions are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities in preventing corruption.
In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition and transparency and controls as central elements of the Prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations aim above all at greater transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of works and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant rules specify the manner in which anti-corruption bids are to be taken into account during the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In particular, the BRH considers that the overriding principle of the open procedure or the public procurement procedure is an appropriate Instrument to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulation.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and Manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no fundamental need for changes to the corresponding specifications of the administrations in the awarding of construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have shown shortcomings in the implementation of certain requirements.
Building administrations should further train their staff on the guidelines for preventing corruption and raise their awareness of this issue even more.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building administration to freelancers.
Without controls and adequate safeguards, however, the risk of misuse increases when tasks are delegated.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be assigned to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.
NKÚ
The Czech Republic adopted at government level a strategy against corruption in which public procurement is the most important component.
The Procurement Act and its implementing rules have been substantially amended.
The Nkú audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, as contracting entities must justify the efficiency of the award of contracts, the calculation of expected prices, the adequacy of qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the type of evaluation, and duly document and publish all these aspects.
Make recommendations
The NKÚ the BRH to assess the implementation of the EU requirements, in principle, positive.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that EU bids of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous potential for material and immaterial damage caused by Manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the construction authorities in their countries as required to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and Manipulation.
In particular, the Organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for vulnerabilities and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures should be increased in the Czech Republic, as open procedures can provide a wider scope for competition and significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of works into lots may also have a beneficial effect on supply prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of tenderers.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient contracting authorities ' procurement activities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building authorities. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks – with the exception of transport projects – are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors appointed by them.
The sais of both countries have the aim, even after the completion of their joint project, to develop the relevant findings for them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both sais are also convinced that the principles of Public Procurement Law as set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organisation of supreme audit institutions (INTOSAI). Because the principles and findings are of General importance to corruption, countering effectively and to ensure economic procurement of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
