Public Procurement of construction works and construction works
Joint report of the supreme control office of the Czech Republic (nku) and the federal ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on its parallel exams
Introduction and overview
The awarding of services by contracting authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The State has the task of using the public resources as economically and economically as possible and ensuring a fair and regulated competition.
In The European Union (EU), the awarding of services by contracting contracting entities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure a largely unlimited competition also cross-border, contracting authorities have to comply with the requirements of the EU for their award-granted contracts.
To this end, EU member states have the right to transfer and apply the EU's national law in national law.
This has already happened in the Czech Republic as well as in Germany.
Below the eu thresholds, the individual countries are left to regulate the awarding of public contracts themselves.
The awarding of services is also a corruption-prone area.
Due to the fundamentally high damage potential, the contracting authorities have to carry out appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and non-undue benefits when awarding their orders.
The Supreme Court of the Czech Republic (nku) and the federal ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel tests both for the awarding of works and for the corruption.
The main focus of the tests was the application of the eu environmental legislation, which was implemented in national regulations, as well as the korruptionsvorbeugung in the awarding of construction works in construction and the transport infrastructure.
The forgave below the eu thresholds were also included in the reflections with regard to korruptionsvorbeugung.
The test results of both audit are summarized in this joint report.
The report should also be addressed to international institutions - such as the international organisation of the Supreme Security Council (Intosai).
Audit areas and verified positions the evaluations of the bundesrechnungshofes on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests, which he carried out in the years 2011/2012 at the bauverwaltungen, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal Federal Republic in Germany.
For example, he examined the construction of motorways as well as large high construction projects.
In addition, the, results from previous studies.
The Czech Republic's Supreme Ministry of education presented its evaluation findings from the years 2008 to 2011 the tests included construction works in road construction, in construction, in water engineering, in building construction (hospitals, hospitals, hospitals, etc.).) as well as other other baubereiche in the Czech Republic.
The awarding of public contracts by the federal government mainly leads the federal government of Germany to the federal government.
In the Czech Republic, the state aid for the grant of transport infrastructure is central to the public.
In building construction, the allocations are carried out decentralized by those who use state budget.
In both countries, freelance workers are also energized for parts of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in the market structure and the market structure for works of both countries can be taken into account.
Construction of the award in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of euwide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement Procedures Limited to the national area are governed by the budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.
For both eu and national granted, many additional financial instruments are also provided by administrative internal provisions,
Such as the so-called "awarding manuals" of the federal government, in which the statutory requirements are supplemented by the law of the court of justice getting closer.
In the Czech Republic, the award procedure applies exclusively to the awarding act and other statutory regulations, which apply both to the field above and below the eu thresholds.
The Procurement was significantly reduced in 2012
The new regulation strengthened transparency in the handling of public resources, allowed stronger competition and limited the amount of money in the procurement procedure.
Broad outlines of the award in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedures and the negotiated procedure are in particular for EU-wide granted.
In Germany, the measures below the eu threshold are applied to national types of procurement (public tender, limited tender, direct), but largely correspond to the EU-wide types of awarding.
The Public Transport network in Germany is characterized by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (in the case of the EU-wide) and the public tender (for National Awarding Contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company can offer an offer.
Another essential feature of the German business market is the promotion of Medium-sized companies.
For this purpose, the division of a total production capacity in specialist and industrial areas is mainly used.
The individual awarding of these lots is intended to allow as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both mentioned features of the German award are proven instruments to achieve economic results.
In Germany, over 330.000 construction companies are with 1,9 million. Employees work.
In the Czech Republic, the euwide procurement procedures are also to be applied in construction projects below the eu threshold.
One exception here is the simplified procedure, where a less strict procedure can be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
In accordance with eu law, the Czech National law contains provisions to conclude contracts when competition is guaranteed and a beneficial price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic leave the contracting authority the choice between the open and the non-open procedure.
In the Czech Republic there are more than 85.000 construction companies, of which about 1.900 companies with 20 and more employees are involved.
Volume Contracting authorities and shares of the awarding species in both countries
In Germany, the entire market in 2011 was 307 billion. Euro.
Of this accounted for 45,5 billion. Euro on public construction (15 %), which includes the construction of the federal states and municipalities, in addition to the construction of the city.
The Federal Ministry of construction and construction (without construction and water engineering) included 8,5 billion. Euro.
The volume of orders for construction works in the construction and construction of the Federal Republic was distributed to the awarding species in 2011 as follows: 80,7 % open procedures and public procurement, 12,7 % Non-open procedures and limited calls for tenders and 6,6 % negotiated procedures and direct.
Of this, 33,2 % were Europe-wide.
The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to 4,7 billion in 2011 Euro, which corresponded to about 25 % of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was 7,8 billion. Euro, which corresponded to 37 % of the total price.
Breakdown by type of species for 2011: 65,1 % open procedures 14,3 % Non-public procedures 9,5 % negotiated procedure 8,4 % simplified procedures for orders under the threshold 2.7 % other procedures
The data refer to all public contracts for deliveries, services and works, which were awarded by public entities in 2011
The above data shows that the parallel exams of both countries are based on a significant part of public procurement, which has a major financial impact in all the grants to be awarded, and in the awarding of orders the open procedure and the public tender is an outstanding priority.

Summary of the results of parallel exams
The Supreme Court of the Czech Republic (nku) and the federal ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel tests in their countries for the awarding of works and for the maintenance of
The working groups of both audit compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel tests, which were carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
They were mainly determined by the following:
The EU guidelines for the awarding of works by contracting authorities have been implemented in national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (no. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the eu requirements, the korruptionsvorbeugung also serve the awarding regulations of both countries, which differ partly in their main areas and their detail (no. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the awarding documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for a proper application of the contract.
The minimum prices must be neutral and must not have competitive conditions.
In Germany, the awarding documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the contract sufficiently.
In Germany, construction works are to be divided into lots in order to promote the competition.
According to the findings of the brh, this requirement has been largely implemented in Germany.
In its tests, in particular in the field of road, the nku found that the awarding of extensive services without loose or with only very large batches could affect competition and could lead to a restriction on only a few large companies.
One of the reasons for this is that significant increases in costs can be caused by the risk of price or other collusion.
According to the provisions of both countries, the contracting entities may, under certain conditions, arrange additional or changed services with the already mandated companies, which are necessary after the completion of the original contract (no. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of awarding have been predominantly followed in both countries.
According to the rules of the Czech Republic, the contracting entities can choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the primacy of the open procedure for EU-wide forgave and budget is enshrined in the the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure at national awarding.
This allows more companies to offer offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes it difficult to price agreements between bidders and leads to the most effective results.
In the construction projects, whose estimated total investment costs reached or exceeded the eu threshold, the audited construction projects granted the construction works in principle throughout Europe.
The correct value of the expected contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of awarding.
In Germany, data bases are used for the cost of investigations in public buildings, especially in building construction,
The construction projects completed on the evaluations are based.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (no. 4.2).
The works to be carried out throughout Europe are to be published before information and notices. This is intended to strengthen the competition by giving interested companies early on the planned awards.
The verified bauverwaltungen were usually considered to be this preset.
In individual cases, faulty information, incorrect applications or. Lack of controls possibly the competition (no. 4.3).
The selection of applicants for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly manipulation prone.
According to eu law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure a real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and be announced before.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting entities in both countries should change as often as possible in the selection of applicants under the call for companies.
In order to meet the manipulation danger, there are some very detailed requirements in Germany.
The audited administrations did not ignore these requirements in some cases.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection were not always understandable (no. 4.4).
In both countries, during the phase, in the interest of a competitive competition, it is necessary to ensure that the companies interested in a tender receive the same information
A contact between these companies with each other and with freelance workers who were involved in the creation of the specifications should be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive collusion.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The Verified Bauverwaltungen in Germany did not hold these requirements in part (no. 4.5).
In the opening of the offers, in both countries, the mehraugen principle and the transparency should be observed.
The requirements for the identification, documentation, storage and confidentiality of offers are to reduce manipulation margins and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The exams in both countries showed a few complaints (no. 4.6).
Testing and rating of the offers are determined in both countries by requirements for the construction and distribution of services.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been observed continuously by the audited contracting entities.
For example, contracting authorities handed down offers for testing to third parties without checking the offers before and documenting anomalies sufficiently.
The offers were inadequately protected against subsequent manipulations (no. 4.7).
At the end of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition should be informed about the intended assignment before awarding.
This legal possibility also has a preventive function against corrupt behavior.
The Czech Republic sees a judicial review possibility also for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases, the contracting entities did not hold the specified deadlines in the case of the auftragserteilungen or were able to obtain content from the offer of tenderers (4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures has not always been complete or understandable in the audited bauverwaltungen in both countries.
The EU-wide transparency was not sufficiently implemented in so far as the awarding notes of some procedures were concerned.
Also, some of the deficiencies found are the corruption preventive function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely came to their reporting and reporting requirements (no. 4.9).
Basics of the EU award and the korruptionsvorbeugung
EU-procurement
In order to ensure an unrestricted competition with free services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the awarding of coordination and the coordination procedures that were to be implemented by the mitglieds8 states in national law.
The General Awarding principles of the European Union are, in particular, the competition bid, the equality or. The Prohibition of discrimination and the prohibition of discrimination.
To implement these objectives, the award of the award includes special regulations for the EU-wide construction works for construction projects.
To this end, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed a circumference of currently 5.000.000 euros.
The rules concern in particular the content of the awarding documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the awarding, the compliance of deadlines, including for the entrance of the offers, the documentation of the procurement procedure, the requirements to be applied to the qualification of the applicants can and the rechtsmittelrichtlinie form the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.
In Case of possible breaches of the contract, companies may be able to check the decisions of the contracting authorities in review procedures
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have implemented the directives of the European Union in national law.
Korruptionsvorbeugung
Meaning of the korruptionsvorbeugung
In both countries, there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In General, under corruption, you understand the abuse of a private property to the private advantage,
Which is usually caused by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and have significant economic damage.
According to estimates, the worldwide cost of corruption is 5 % of world economic performance.
For The European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1
For contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may question the trust in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public contracting entities.
You will be able to review the construction and management processes of your administrations in particularly highly sensitive areas in order to make appropriate environmental measures against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making against anti-fraud abuse.
The awarding of public works is basically considered to be a particularly corruption-related field of work.
Measures to korruptionsvorbeugung
In Germany, corruption is followed - in particular bribery and licensing, as well as licensing and approval - criminal and criminal law.
In order to prevent corruption, the federal government has adopted a directive and recommendations on preventive prevention in the federal administration. After that, in addition to the risk analysis, the following basic phrases are to be considered in particular: priority of public calls and open procedures, more-eye principle and transparency, principle separation of planning, awarding and billing, accurate and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption regulations have been incorporated into the rules of the law.
This is how the competent federal ministry of awarded in the field of bundesfernstraßen has introduced an electronically-based control system,
With the awarding data − such as the estimated costs and the order sums − as well as information on the participants involved in the field and evaluated on anomalies.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also followed by criminal and criminal sanctions.
The statutory commandments of transparency and equal treatment of bidders and the prohibition of any discrimination form the main foundations of the law.
For Public Procurement, the Czech government has set antikorruptionsmaßnahmen in a strategy paper on corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated for the years 2013 to 2014
Some of the measures recommended have already been put into practice in national legislation and relevant administrative regulations.
The new legislation contains essentially the following rules: reduction of thresholds for smaller orders, obligation to notice the prior notice of the award of the award, including mention of the tendering reasons, prohibition of the restriction of the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus abolition of the possibility to bidders selection by lottery, introduction of the obligation to publish the order documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Test results at the individual stages of the procurement procedure
Awarding documents
Awarding documents the awarding documents must contain all the information that tenderers need for a proper application process.
In particular, the awarding documents must allow for a correct calculation.
The bidders must not transfer risks that are not calculable for them.
The awarding documents consist in particular of the terms of reference and the contract terms.
In addition, they contain the requirements to demonstrate the qualification (suitability) of the bidders and the criteria that are relevant to the selection of the economical offer.
Requirements of eu law and the law of the sea
The requirements of the eu right to the awarding documents are addressed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit the competition as little as possible.
The terms of reference must basically be product neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the specifications is only allowed under narrow conditions.
Avoiding competition restrictive requirements in the awarding documents is also an elementary principle of korruptionsvorbeugung.
In addition, unclear or ambiguous information can be avoided in the awarding documents, as they open the margin for speculation in the creation of the offers and for manipulations in their rating.
Regulations of the German and Czech National Court
Same or similar regulations in both countries, the eu legal requirements for technical specifications are implemented in national law.
The services are basically product neutral without any made requirements.
In the specifications, the individual services must normally be divided into units with respective quantities of quantities.
The prices on the basis of units are to be agreed (e.g. euro per m² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can achievements be defined by functional targets.
The specifications must be complete and clear in any case.
They have precise quantities of quantities to contain and must not include any performance where they are not determined.
Remuneration by package or by time of time should be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulations based on indeterminate requirements in the awarding documents.
The specifications must allow tenderers to create their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders is to be announced only when the awarding documents are finished.
Different regulations different from each other
An obligation to tender for construction works in loose is not in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of performance to be carried out, the public authorities can divide construction works into several lots.
In Germany, construction works are basically divided into lots, separately according to the quantity (manner) and / or by type or subject of subject (subject-matter).
This allows medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price fixing more difficult.
This type of awarding is considered to be the most common.
Who must be indicated in the Czech Republic both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures in the awarding documents.
This will allow the applicants to be fully and definitively recognisable according to which criteria their offers should be counted.
In Germany, the indication of who is required in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the awarding documents, is only mandatory in the EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the who can only hold a notice in a certificate of award
Awarding documents created by representatives of freelance professionals may not contain any information on these offices or involved planners or experts in Germany in the building and in some of the construction projects.
This is intended to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other unacceptable competitive advantages without knowledge of the contraaing authority via contact with these freelance workers.
This is also the reason why freelance awarding documents can neither ship nor be able to interpret plans for insight.
The Company's contact person is the client alone.
In the Czech Republic, there is currently no regulation.
Additional or changed services, which are necessary after the completion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always falling for large construction projects.
In both countries, the statutory provisions allow to a certain extent the awarding of payment services to the already mandated company without having to carry out a procurement procedure with public notice.
According to eu requirements and German provisions, the remuneration of the supplementary services may not exceed half of the minimum wage.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main without any significant disadvantages or must be required.
In the Czech Republic, for a corresponding awarding without public notice, a closer limit of 20 %.
This increases, however, if necessary. The risk of delayed completion of the construction work or the need to participate in an additional contractor in the already ongoing construction work.
If the already mandated company is also transferred to supplementary services, a random price increase for these services by the contractor is not in principle possible according to the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basics of the payment of the order already issued are to be expected.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the amount of money.
In the Czech Republic, quantities can not be netted with additional supplementary services.
Essential Test results
Bhr
Technical specifications and invitation to tender
In individual cases, the specifications contained references to national technical approvals or standards that have already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some specifications also contained product-related requirements - for example, for graffitischutz, grout tapes or noise-Free -, without this required.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product came into question.
After services detailed bills
In any of the procedures audited, the brh has not detected infringements of the bid, in principle, in a specifications by specifications.
Completeness of the specifications
In the vast number of procedures, the awarding documents were completed before the start of the invitations to tender.
In some procedures, the awarding documents had to be corrected during the application period, since partly positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the most common positions were not determined if they were needed.
A specifications for demolition even was almost half of such needs positions.
Loose and who criteria
In many cases, the mandatory justification was missing, why the most popular services were not further divided into manner.
There were no objections to the indication of the criteria to be laid down in the rating of the offers.
Tips On Freelance workers
A small part of the specifications contained hints of the participants involved.
Their names were partly on the flyleaves or in attached plans or opinions.
In One Case, the registry even expressly asked the applicants to contact the architect " to ask for the invitation to tender
In particular in the building sector, the contracting entities were mainly responsible for the failure to make the most of the complaints that were made by the establishment of
The baud systems provide the lack of capacities to control the safety of the specifications.
Nku
Technical specifications and an invitation to tender for public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 housing units were provided in the specifications a supplier and a specific service.
The Registry did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
For the construction of several construction, suppliers and products were also provided in the invitation to tender.
Specifications with units
For construction projects in some industrial areas, the scale and type of services required in the construction industry were not clearly identified.
As a units, she only gave the conversions space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of the specifications
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the specifications were changed four times during a non-open procedure during the period August to September 2009,
Since the packages has expanded significantly and the technical conditions have changed.
Tender documents for projects contained inaccurate location, insufficient preliminary preliminary examinations and incomplete drawings, which had to be entrusted with additional services.
When building a large floor, the specifications of the interior design did not contain requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors built overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Lots and selection criteria
In the Czech Republic, the distribution of construction works is in manner or. The awarding of contracts is not mandatory.
A test of the three large sections of the construction of a ring showed that in a los-wise awarding of selected parts savings up to 31,6 million. Euro at total cost of 620,3 million euro would have been possible.
For example, six different buildings, which were the subject of a single order, would have been awarded by 2,5 million. Euro (25 %) can be saved.
The construction of 20 bridges would be a huge savings of 11,5 million in the case of a 20-bridge construction. Euro (25 %) was possible.
In the awarding of construction works in road construction, the central registry provided very extensive reference requirements as selection criteria.
In the construction of a part of a motorway, the bidders demanded the detection of at least three carried-out units worth 28 million each in an open procedure. Euro from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, at most nine providers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects, in which the registry as a suitability criterion for the companies is an annual minimum of 480 million. Euro in the last three years.
Two-thirds of the funds used for road in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2,5 billion. Euro of a total of 3,7 billion. Euro) accounted for a total of five companies that carried out the orders alone or as a working group.
At 46 procurement procedures with a minimum price of 528 million. Euro only gave two or two. Even only one bidder is offering an offer.
The nku showed that a narrowing of the market could lead to significant increases in costs.
Additional achievements
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the registry did not apply any of the legally prescribed procedures in two cases and also did not lock any written contracts on the additional services.
Due to unclear quantities of quantities and quantities, supplements was produced in the first case of up to 63,7 million. Euro (net) and in the second case up to 165,4 million. Euro (net), which means that the respective order volume is 21 % and 21 % respectively. 91 % increased.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
For several construction, some services were not listed in the awarding documents, although their necessity was already known during the awarding process.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20 % of the original price fixed in the national procurement, the registry carried out negotiated procedures with the mandated companies without awarding notice.
In the construction of a large building, the registry retained the right to forgive additional works in negotiated negotiated procedures without tender.
During the construction period, the construction industry expanded the scope of the work by 2 million. Euro.
The additional works for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further findings
Due to a construction project of construction projects, the nku found that the average cost of construction of a authorities motorway in the Czech Republic was up to 14,6 million. Euro is.
In Deuschland, after an evaluation of long-term data of the commissioned, the average cost of a authorities motorway kilometers is up to 10,4 million. Euro.
This comparison indicates that the motorways in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary Findings
The basic rules on the awarding documents are largely consistent in both countries and take into account the rules of the contract.
They serve both a comprehensive and fair competition as well as the korruptionsvorbeugung.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the specifications to give tenderers the appropriate calculation and creation of their offers,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed before and also contain space-related spaces.
The common basic requirements for the awarding documents are supplemented in Germany by regulations which will further reduce the amount of waste and waste water.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, for this the transparency is increased by publishing the who in the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for terms of reference have been largely respected in both countries.
In some cases, however, derogations had to be contested, which may also have led to restrictions of competition.
In Germany, the bid for the formation of loose supports the competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the findings of the nku, the awarding of extensive services can be without loose or with only very large loose restrictions on the provider's field to a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements laid down in the Czech Republic in road construction have led to public contracts being awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and smaller and medium-sized companies are not allowed to participate in the competition.
Also, a limited number of in often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
In the awarding and remuneration of additional or changed services, the payment costs in both countries differ from one another.
According to eu requirements and German provisions, supplementary services with a value up to half of the contract can be awarded under certain conditions without procurement procedures with public notice.
In the Czech Republic, a closer limit of 20 %, is valid until the additional achievements in the negotiated procedure can be awarded without notice to the original contractor.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
This border is often exceeded,
Since the scope of public procurement is often insufficiently determined.
If the overrun is greater than 20 %, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By Splitting services in lots, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the type of awarding and taking into account the eu threshold
By defining the type of award, the contracting entity determines the amount of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It may leave the circle of possible applicants and bidders, for example by choosing an open procedure, largely unlimited or by the default of non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of construction projects where a threshold established by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures shall be applied.
Requirements of eu law and the law of the sea
When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority shall, in particular, take into account the most competitive bids for competition and transparency.
Is the estimate of the construction works of a project at or. Over the eu threshold of currently 5.000.000 euros, the construction works are in principle to be awarded across Europe after open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may, in the case of construction projects reaching or exceed the eu threshold, derogate from the principle of Europe-wide awarding and give construction works in National Procurement, provided that the estimated value of the respective loose is less than 1.000.000 euros and the sum of this loose 20 % of the estimated total value of all works contracts does not exceed.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reasons or deliberately estimated at low cost values to avoid the commitment to the principle of Europe-wide awarding of construction works.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the manipulation risk, the choice of the type of award comes to a major importance in the application of the contract.
The detailed explanatory statement of the chosen award and the examination of the application obligation of the eu awarding regulations are important components of the documentation of the procurement procedure.
Regulations of the German and Czech National Court
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully implemented the eu legal requirements on the procurement procedures and the threshold in national law.
Different regulations different from each other
The Czech Republic has transferred the principle of open and non-open procedures in the directive to its construction, which are not subject to the EU.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure without the decision to be made on documentary animals or to justify it. Other procedures are, however, only possible according to certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national awarding, the public tender is basically priority. This is determined by the budgetary and budgetary policy and by the guidelines for the financial management.
Other types of awarding - as well as the non-open procedure or. The Limited call for tenders is only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the final report.
The existence of a ausnahmefalls must be clearly justified and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public call for tender should ensure as unlimited competition as possible, exclude proposed by setting up certain bidders and complicate possible price fixing among tenderers.
The principle of public tender is a central element of the public procurement in Germany.
The correct value of the expected contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of awarding.
The baud rates in Germany can be used to determine the expected costs in the field of public transport services on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organizations.
These databases are based on the evaluation of finished construction projects. The databases include, among other things, cost parameters for categories, usage units, components or individual construction works.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected value of a planned. or one to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only some bauverwaltungen in Germany.
A Nationwide Introduction to all straßenbauverwaltungen is planned.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic can not rely on central databases or average price of comparable construction works when determining the expected cost of construction works.
In most cases, the cost investigation is based on estimates of the financing institution or is derived from the amount of the funds provided by the baud office.
Measures to standardize costs investigation are still in the beginnings.
The Competent Ministries received the mission to create a database for standardized building materials and fabrics within the framework of the corruption test for 2011-2012
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
In this database, information on the construction and construction and expansion of, and other costs data is to be collected in order to allow cost investigations and provisions of unit.
The Czech Ministry of transport has also published a data collection for construction projects for better cost control,
Which is supposed to be used as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently updated.
Essential Test results brh
Choice of procurement procedure
The audited entities wrote the works largely in the open process or. in public tender, followed by the budgetary and budgetary requirements.
In 2011, 59,5 % of the construction works of the federal building were public or public. Advertised in open procedure.
In Road construction, this percentage was 94,8 %.
In the choice of non-public types of procurement, there were partly detailed justifications for why the contracting entities were the principle of open procedure or the public invitation to tender had to deviate.
At a tested, the brh, based on more than 16.000 procurement procedures, found that the non-public awarding species have significant disadvantages in the competition and increase manipulation and licensing costs compared to open procedures and public procurement.
In building construction, more than twice as many offers were submitted for public tenders, as with limited invitations to tender and almost three times as many offers as in the case of
The investigation also showed that, in the case of limited invitations to tender and direct, the average prices were 6 % and 6 % respectively 10 % higher than in public procurement.
Parallel investigations by the federal court of auditors and a court of auditors confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement.
In the result of his studies on economic efficiency, the bundesbauministerium even came to twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the eu threshold
The audited contracting entities were normally awarding plans for the construction projects for which they had determined an expected investment capacity of more than 5.000.000 euros, in which they established the construction works and the works to be carried out according to national procurement procedures.
According to the awarding plans, there was always a share of more than 80 % of the construction works in the EU-far.
A bypass of the commitment to EU-wide loans due to low-cost estimates was not discernible.
However, partly due to faulty calculations, it came to the factual below of the minimum eu procurement procedure.
During The Christmas period, some contracting entities changed the terms of their awarding plans.
They did not justified these changes and did not show that the minimum proportion of the EU-further procurement procedures was still respected.
For Most of the construction projects audited, the proportion of EU-further grants was usually lower according to the accounting results than according to the awarding plan.
In some cases, the contracting entities violated the requirements of the eu threshold against the preset, all 1.000.000 euro and more comprehensive individual projects in EU-wide procedures,
And chose national procedures instead.

Choice of awarding art
For several major construction projects, such as the construction of some construction projects, construction projects in the context of a large sporting event as well as estate, the contracting authorities shared a number of construction projects, although these services were similar or
The individual services were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated value
In Road construction, the price databases for this area were an insufficient instrument to determine the expected cost of transport.
The data was based on just completed construction projects, but there were indications of lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional costs or excessive profits from the companies responsible.
At three sections of a ring, actual prices were about 37 % below those estimated by the database.
The Ministry of transport revised the databases in order to take account of not only the prices of the last years, but also comparable market prices and price lift indices in the market.
In building construction, the expected investment costs were based on the cost values estimated by the project architects or on the estimates of investors.
The actual growth rates were strongly dependent on the estimates.
The estimate for the around-or. Expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed value, but eight supplements led to an increase of 2,1 million in the course of the construction. Euro or 27 %.
Similarly, the actual value of the construction of a library depot was 33 % lower than the construction price, and there were also increases in the construction phase here.
In other cases, the prices exceeded the estimates and increased during the time of the year.
In the construction of a large library, the estimate was 16 million. Euro or 22 % exceeded. In the construction of a justice building, the costs increased with 139 % disproportionate, as the land area had only expanded by 12
Summary Findings
Both countries have implemented eu regulations to define the type of awarding and to take account of the eu threshold in national law. Therefore, the respective regulations correspond to a large extent.
The main priority of the open procedure in Germany. However, the public call for tenders goes beyond the eu requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
In comparison with the non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the competition in public procedures or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most effective results.
The risk of corruption is significantly improved by restricting the applicant field by manipulation of the contraaing authority's requirements and by making price fixing between tenderers more difficult.
The research has the main role of the primacy of the open procedure or. The public tender in Germany confirmed.
According to Czech legislation, the contracting authorities can award orders in open or non-open procedures.
According to the latest changes in the procurement, the number of bidders can no longer be limited in procedures with the advance of participation competition.
Therefore, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting entities have the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or. The public tender is largely followed. In the Czech Republic, some services have been illegally divided in order to circumvent the requirements to choose the type of awarding.
When taking into account the eu threshold, mistakes had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a lower rate of EU-wide services.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to determine the expected costs of construction works and construction projects.
The Bauverwaltungen should, if necessary. Further checks ensure that the requirements for the choice of type of award and the EU-wide range of services comply with the scope of the services the conditions for the correct cost investigation are created.
Prior information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction works throughout Europe, the public builder has already informed interested companies in the run-up to the invitation to tender.
Before Information and notices form an important basis for a Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of eu law and the law of the sea
The Pre-information should contain the essential information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated investment price reaches or exceeds the eu threshold and in which the contracting entity wants to shorten the offer deadlines open or non-open procedures.
In Notices, the contracting authority has to specify more details about the contracts to be awarded in Europe.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
In It, he has, among other things, the scope of services, the procedures for procedures and the application, the special requirements and the who and their weighting.
In The description of the subject, the European unified vocabulary of the common procurement vocabulary (cpv codes) is to be used.
Information and notices will be published in the official journal of the European Union and the buyer profile of the contraaing authority.
In order to prevent a disadvantage of foreign interested parties, notices at national level may not contain additional information and will be published at the office for official publications of the European Union only after submitting the text of the text.
Incomplete or incomplete information in the notice may affect the competition and, if necessary. Even support manipulations.
Regulations of the German and Czech National Court
Same or similar regulations
The EU legal requirements for the prior information and the notice have fully implemented both countries in national law.
Different regulations different from each other
In the Czech Republic, information and notices can also be published in the case of non-Europe-wide works.
Procurement procedures may not be submitted to the EU Official Journal (EU-wide) at least one month after the delivery of the prior information. Started to the National Official Journal (for all awarded).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a prior information notice be waived.
In Germany, no information is necessary for the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the national procurement procedures, notices of public tenders and participation competitions are presented before limited invitations to tender on the internet portal of the Federal Republic and also in newspapers or magazines to publish.
For Limited invitations to tender without participation competition, notices of services to be awarded are required from 25.000 euros (ex ante transparency).
In the pre-Information, all planned lots of construction projects are to be listed.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the kleinteiligkeit of the go construction.
In the Czech Republic, this regulation has only a small impact, since much less construction works are divided into lots.

Before information
The audited entities published in all audited construction projects with the information to be carried out throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened supply deadlines, although the deadline of 52 days needed between the pre-order of the information and the notices was not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only advertised after the pre-order period of the prior information prior to the prior notice expired and before it was extended
For many published information, there was no evidence of the planned distribution of construction works in lots.
Notices notices notices notices notices
The notices of the audited bodies contained partially cpv codes which were different from the information of the before information or which did not apply to the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information - for example on the time - as the notices in the official journal of the European Union.
Ex ante transparency.
The contracting entities of a verified service provider had commissioned a service provider to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the stories on his own paid awarding platform.
The contracting authorities did not verify whether the company had forwarded the notifications as required to the free internet portal of the federal government.
Samples showed that only one third of the reports of the audited administration were published on this portal.

Notices notices notices notices notices
In the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the registry did not provide the criteria for which it wanted to select the bidders in its notice.
The Registry could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was allowed in accordance with the law in force.
In the construction of a ring, the registry did not provide any further information in the notice or in the documentation of the procurement procedure, which would evaluate the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants wanted to allow them to compete.
In their assessment, the registry came to the conclusion that all six applicants corresponded to the qualification requirements, but in the case of the worst reviews, the applicant concluded from the further procedure
The approach of the registry was not transparent, because at no time of the procedure it had announced information on the qualification and the evaluation procedure.
Publication of notices
In the renovation of former military terrain, the registry did not publish the call.
Summary Findings
The Two-day information system with prior notice and notice is an important part to implement the transparency in Europe's award-giving awards, to strengthen competition and thus to prevent corruption.
Both countries have implemented eu requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures also in the national procurement sector:
Selection of applicants for non-public procurement
Contrary to the public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the execution of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition in the non-public procurement procedures.
In the non-public procurement procedures, the registry has in advance a selection of which companies should be invited to submit their tenders.
Requirements of eu law and the rules of the European Union allow for a limitation of the number of applicants in the EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are invited to
At negotiated negotiated procedures, at least three companies are invited.
In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure a real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and are to be announced before.
The choice of the company is a process within the procurement procedure, which is highly prone to manipulation, e.g. by unilaterally favouring certain companies.
In addition, the restriction of the competition on a few companies also favours possible collusion of applicants.
In both cases, the result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the contraaing authority.
The contracting entities have therefore to make special arrangements against possible manipulations, to carry out sufficient checks and in particular to ensure the transparency and transparency of this system.
Regulations of the German and Czech National Court
Same or similar regulations
The rules on the selection of applicants are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU, the contracting entities should change as often as possible in the selection of applicants under the request of the companies.
Also, the competition must not be limited to companies resident in certain regions.
The contracting entities have to justify the selection of applicants and document the process of the competition in their awarding notes.
Different regulations different from each other
In Germany, in the case of limited invitations to tender, at least three and in principle, several suitable applicants are invited to
According to the new Czech rules, the number of bidders is not limited to the number of bidders, without the exception of the open procedures and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the most common-eye principle is to be observed in the selection of companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the baud office or an agent from the registry will usually change this proposal by removing about a proposed company and / or a new one complete companies.
This is intended to prevent a single person from concluding the circle of the companies to which the competition is to be held.
Otherwise, this could allow far-reaching collusion among the involved in the case of manipulative intentions.
The list of requests to ask the company is to be treated confidentially, even in relation to freelance people, and not to be accessible in general.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
In the Czech Republic, appropriate rules for setting up and recruiting applicants are not available.
According to the German regulations, freelance workers may not determine the company's request, but can only submit proposals to the company.
In Czech legislation, there is a change of opinion.

Number of applicants
The requirement to ask for a minimum number of companies for the submission of non-public procurement has been complied with in a few exceptions.
An Evaluation of the sales process of almost 7.000 Non-Europe-wide procurement of construction works in building construction showed that, in the case of limited invitations to tender by the federal government in Germany, the contracting entities had an average of 6,6 and an
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular, with a few suppliers, the contracting entities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
They took account of the well-known and proven companies in their view.
As a reason for this, they provided that, in non-public procedures, the suitability of the company to ask for competition should be ensured before the call for a bid.
An unacceptable restriction on regional bidders was not determined by the brh in the non-public procurement procedures, but probably a higher proportion of regional companies than in public procurement.
The contracting entities were particularly concerned that the scope of the non-public procurement procedures was significantly lower on average and therefore, for example, longer sales costs are more likely to fall in the weight of public procurement.
More-Eye-principle and proposals freelance
Contrary to the rules, the contracting entities are predominantly responsible for inviting the proposed list to change the company by an independent person.
They justified this, in particular with lack of knowledge, lack of knowledge or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
Often, it was not documented who proposed the companies to be offered to the tender.
Some samples showed that freelance workers had set up the applicants and these proposals had been taken over by the contracting entities unchanged.
In this way, the contracting entities did not protect themselves from possible manipulations.
Confidential treatment of bidders lists
In a case study, the lists of calls for the company were covered in a data system that could be viewed by all the staff of this department.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or. Approved companies can be illegally passed and, for example, can allow collusion among these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the procurement procedures contained justifications for the selection of applicants only in a few cases.
Nku
Selection of applicants
In the construction of a ring, the bidders did not receive information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures
In the non-open procedures for the expansion and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not contain any information on how the selection of applicants should be carried out.
In a procedure, all eight participating applicants fulfilled the qualification requirements, which exceeded the maximum number of cnous companies.
The Awarding Committee then carried out a training programme for the selection of companies.
This then basically permissible approach should have been led as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary Findings
Due to the high manipulation risk in the selection of applicants in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have made special arrangements to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the more-eye principle, the keep of the bidders lists and the sole authority of the contracting entities to propose the request to the companies, the German regulations restrict such a abuse.
In the Czech regulations, the newly introduced preset of the largely unlimited number of bidders can counteract possible restrictions on the use of non-public procedures.
However, the findings have shown that part of these requirements are insufficient to implement and the manipulation potential for a reduced limit of the participant field has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
Contracting authorities should completely eliminate the identified deficits.
Phase
With the announcement of the awarding or the invitation to tender begins with the invitation to tender, in which the companies can create offers on the basis of the awarding documents.
Applicants May submit their offers until the end of the deadline for submission of tenders fixed by the registry.
Requirements of eu law and the law of the sea
There are no separate eu legal requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.
The contracting entities have to consider the national rules to counteract the existing financial situation during the period of the contract.
This is mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of the German and Czech National Court
Same or similar regulations
The awarding documents, on the basis of which the companies are supposed to create their offers, are in principle only to be sent through the registry.
Freelance workers involved in the procurement procedure may not perceive this task.
The registry has to ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the period of application.
In Case of ambiguities on the awarding documents or other questions regarding the invitation to tender, only the information may be provided to the applicants.
Non-freelance working persons may not provide information with the creation of the awarding documents.
During the entire training period, a contact between the representatives of freelance workers and the applicants is to be prevented.
Freelance workers must not become a hub of the procurement procedure that contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be produced.
Offers submitted by mail or directly submitted are to be submitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically submitted offers have a technical encryption.
Different regulations different from each other
In Germany, the registry can also instruct external service providers with the printing and shipping of the awarding documents, whose employees are to be committed to the secrecy of the offers and to the conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.
The received offers are to be marked in Germany with a stamp and send them directly, immediately and unopened to a staff responsible for custody.
This staff member may not be involved in the awarding.
The received offers are to be kept under closure until the end of the month.
In the Czech Republic, the received offers are marked with a document number.
The registry will hold the data including numbers as well as the creation and entry information in a protocol.
The Storage of the offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.

The exams for the phase were focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a high school school.
Shipping of the awarding documents
The entities of the audited high-quality suppliers sent the awarding documents themselves or made them print and ship through an external service provider.
Freelance workers did not send any awarding documents.
Information to applicants
The verified high quality standards did not include the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding in the appointment of the contact persons for questions and information.
In the specifications, contrary to the requirements, she did not give employees from the registry, but from the project as a contact person.
Some awarding documents even included the names of the freelance workers who had created the specifications.
In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information when requests during the application period.
Identification of offers
In the audited high-quality product, all received offers were provided with stamp and entry note.
However, the offers were awarded in the case of a number of employees, which disagreed with the pre-orders for the korruptionsvorbeugung.
Keeping the offers
According to their identification, not all offers were directly and immediately to the staff responsible for custody, who included the offers in a unit.
In a baud office, the offers were in the meantime in an open compartment of the post office, to which each member of staff had access.
Another Department had hung up a mailbox in a not constantly monitored hallway, in which the offers there were partly even overnight.
Since the feeder of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only staff, but also visitors of the department would have had the opportunity to take received offers and, if necessary. To manipulate.
Nku
No defects were contested on the Czech side.
Summary Findings
During the training period, in both countries, contacts between interested companies and professionals involved in the procurement process are to be prevented.
By receiving the same information, the principle of equal treatment is also to be respected.
The regulations on the entrance, storage and secrecy of offers appear to be suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are a little more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The findings of the research in Germany have resulted in breaches of the regulations in some areas.
These imperfections could be eliminated with a little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening appointment, the offers closed until then will be opened and their content is recited and thus made known.
From the beginning of the contract, the bidders are bound to their offers until the end of the award period set by the registry.
Requirements of eu law and the law of the sea
There are no separate eu legal regulations for the opening of the offers.
However, the national rules for the procurement of goods contain extensive requirements for the protection of offers and competition for this phase of the procurement procedure.
The More-eye principle as well as the transparency and transparency of the opening should prevent manipulations and changes in the submitted offers.

Summary Findings
The regulations of both countries to open up the offers are in line with relevant parts. They take into account both the mehraugen principle and the transparency. This makes it possible to limit the corruption and manipulation risks in the opening of offers.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than the ones in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the detailed documentation of the procedure as well as the identification, the safe storage and the confidentiality of the offers are significantly reduced, such as subsequent changes in the offers.
In addition, the representatives of the opening of the offers may not perform any other tasks related to the performance to be awarded.

Testing and rating of offers
Testing and rating of the offers of the contracting entities has to examine and values the offers available at the of.
It shall determine the offer for the award of the award, which is the best in accordance with the prescribed award criteria.
Requirements of eu law and the law of the sea
The EU's guidelines provide for a more effective procedure:
First of all, the suitability of tenderers.
Tenderers must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical skills.
Companies are in principle excluded from participation in the procurement procedure, which, for example, are legally convicted for bribery or fraud.
The offers of the non-excluded bidders are to be tested, technically and economically and assessed on the basis of the previously known award criteria.
The client has the most economically advantageous offer to determine. Offers with abnormally low prices have to be checked by the client.
The testing and rating of the offers is a particularly manipulation phase of the procurement procedure.
For example, bidders can be unfairly excluded or offers that do not conform to the requirements will be left in competition.
Due to the preference or disadvantage of tenderers, the result can be unduly impaired and thus prevent the notice of the economically advantageous offer.
The registry has therefore to make special arrangements to ensure that the persons responsible for testing and rating meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It also has the transparency and transparency of the procedure as well as the decisions taken.
Regulations of the German and Czech National Court
Same or similar regulations
According to the EU's requirements, the offers in both countries are to be examined and values in multi-layered procedures.
The requirements for the certification of the suitability of the companies and the award criteria to be taken into account in the rating and their weighting are laid down in the notices or in the awarding documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After checking the suitability of the tenderer, the selection criteria may no longer be used when assessing the offers.
The rating has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers will first be formally examined immediately, whether they are complete and whether they contain anomalies that might indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If tenderers are excluded from the further examination and rating of their offers, they shall be informed immediately.
If the rating of the offers gives an unreasonably low price, the tenderer must receive an opportunity to comment before possible exclusion of his offer.
Decisions taken during the examination and rating of the offers are to be documented.
Different regulations different from each other
In Germany, the secret to holding offers may only be made accessible to persons directly responsible for processing.
The Review of offers as well as the calculation of the offers may only be carried out by the registry.
It only has to use staff members who are not involved in the application of the measure or the implementation of the measure.
The perception of the further audit and management tasks is not regulated.
If freelance employees are mandated with the exam and rating, you have to treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for decisions to be taken by the contracting entities.
In the Czech Republic are to be established for the examination and evaluation of the offers of awarding committees.
The Committees will draw up the reports with awarding proposals.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting entities have to decide on the contracts.
If the documents or explanations required in Germany are only submitted incomplete, the registry has the opportunity to give the tenderers the opportunity to give the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is to be excluded from the rating.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the registry whether it gives the tenderers the opportunity to complete lack of evidence or explanations.
If this fails a bidder, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the prices (Prices For Sales) of the offers are also examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of too low or too high prices for services, the bidder should be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If this does not succeed and the registry can lead to proof of a price reduction of the prices, this offer is excluded.
This is intended to prevent bidders from speculating on a substantial amount of investment costs in the calculation of their offer, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of building projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is counted, but not the adequacy of the prices for services.
A Gift Card cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
For offers with unreasonably high or low prices, a surcharge must not be granted in Germany.
If one or more offers are less than the appropriate customer service of the contraaing authority or the offer sums of the other bidders by 10 % or more, the bidders have to demonstrate the proper kal of their offers.
If you are not able to do so, the registry can exclude the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders can be lifted after the audit of economic cost, if there are only offers with non-articulable at low prices.
In contrast to the German payment system, the surcharge can not be denied for offers with a significantly higher price than the calculation of the contraaing authority.
If the suspicion of an anti-behavioral behavior is suspected in Germany, the registry has to report immediately to its most important level.
This has to decide which measures are to be made and whether the competition or the.. The prosecutor should be taught.
For example, the administrative leading level must agree with the construction of more than 50.000 euros, if freehand grants, a surcharge does not give to the offer at the lowest price or the call for tenders is to be lifted.
There are no corresponding regulations in the Czech Republic.

For some of the proposed companies, the contracting entities did not review the suitability of the companies themselves.
A beneficiaries mandated company without the required suitability of the suitability of the suitability.
In some procedures, it was not understandable whether the registry took into account all known award criteria in their application period or whether they had only put the criterion "Price" to their award.
Selection of persons involved and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting entities set up non-authorised persons during the examination of the offers.
In this way, freelance employees or employees of the service department, who were involved in the planning or execution of a training project, carried out tasks only by employees of the
The Baud control systems are justified by the lack of safety in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelance employees were also involved in the examination of the offers, which were not committed to the secrecy of the offers and to the conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.
For the baud positions, it was usually not understandable whether the offers for the freelance workers were accessible only to persons directly involved in the processing.
Review and calculation of the offers
Some contracting entities handed over the open offers for further testing, without previously carrying out the required review of the offers and the calculations themselves and their results to have documentary-Mentiert.
In the case of verifiable intentions, third changes could have been made to the offers, without this would have been understandable for the contracting entities.
In the verified documents, anomalies or missing price or price changes were partly not or only inadequately marked.
Audit
For a sample in a high-quality sample, the cheapest offers for three quarters of the audited procurement procedures were more than 10 % from the previously determined estimate costs.
Every th procurement procedure has been repealed due to inappropriate payment procedures
Not all offer tests and on illuminating with the bidders were understandable or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more information was missing, such as the main positions of the most important positions
Often, the deviations were only flat-rate, e.g. by hints of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The Baud reports explained that the detection and detection of mixing calculations is difficult.
When a public law was issued, the price offer of the cheapest offer was 66 % below the previously determined estimate of these services.
More detailed tests or studies on the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a aufklärungsgespräch, the registry did not present any evidence of the company's company's company.
It was unclear whether the estimated estimate was excessive or the price of the price was too low.
Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a "Cheap company" that could not hold quality or dates.
In another tender, a baud-issued the surcharge on an offer, whose price was 35 % above the value of the hrca.
She did not raise the invitation to tender and led to the reasons why this company could be closed on a cost-effective calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities that were reported to both of the administrative leading level during a verified construction.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the registry excluded both offers from the procedure.
In the application of the rest of the regulations, the tests did not reveal any major complaints

For many of the audited construction projects, including the construction of the rail, road construction and the extension of the rail rail system, the contracting bidders did not conclude the procedure, although they did not fulfil the requirements indicated in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed on the other hand, a registry could neither prove nor explain why it had ruled out a tenderer who had fulfilled the requirements.
Rating
In the awarding of construction works for a construction project, the registry did not take into account the specified who when testing and assessing the offers.
In a construction project for the extension of the rail system, the registry laid down the weighting of the who only at the beginning of the rating.
In the case of road conservation measures, the preset criterion "shortening the construction phase" was wrongly counted in a procedure
This was due to the insufficient consideration of the offered reduction in the bidders in the second and third position.
Documentation of the offer selection
In three procurement procedures within the framework of the housing, the registry did not documented which criteria it applied and on what basis it had chosen the successful tenderer.
In the construction of a motorway, the company chose the companies for smaller orders up to 20.000 euros alone due to telephone interviews at prices and prices.
Exams of this selection were not possible, since the interviews were not documented.
Summary Findings
The regulations for the testing and rating of the offers correspond to the EU's requirements in both countries.
However, the respective regulations differ from each other for details of the application process and the selection of the participants involved.
In Germany, the procedure is more regulated by detailed requirements, especially in the implementation of the more-eye principle and the protection of offers than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered is to be examined.
In both countries, some of the audited procurement procedures had to determine that essential procedural steps were not or inadequately documented during the testing and rating of the offers.
Without the transparency and transparency of the audit and decision making decisions, possible procedural interventions will be encouraged.
A particularly serious shortage was the handover of all offers to third parties, without the public contracting authority having sufficiently checked and documented the offers before and had protected them from possible manipulations in the further procedure.
When contracting authorities are able to carry out tasks in the testing and evaluation of offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased risk of manipulation are required to answer the increased manipulation risk.
When testing the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always use the set of instruments in full, while only inadequately investigating the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints were given above all in the aptitude test as well as in the application of the who.
Conclusion of the procurement procedure
After checking and values of the offers, the procurement procedure will be completed by granting the contract or by removing the procedure.
Requirements of eu law and the law of the sea
For EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers shall be informed in advance of the planned application period.
The companies have the possibility to receive the intended award for information on electronic way or by telefax within 10 days or. for other means of communication within 15 days to check and if necessary. Initiating a review procedure.
Before the end of this information period, a contract must not be closed.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
If a tenderer puts a request for a request within the information period, a conclusion of a contract is possible only after the final decision in the review procedure
The companies can also check the award through an independent court within the framework of this contract.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of the companies and to stop the client during the entire procurement procedure for the notice of
He has to document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of the German and Czech National Court
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented the EU regulations on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the registry has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and rating of offers.
The contracting authority shall give the order within the announced award deadline,
Also because the bidders are no longer tied to their offers after the end of the deadline.
In open and non-open procedures or public and limited invitations to tender may not deviate from the content of the offer when the contract is concluded.
The unsuccessful bidders are to be informed in a timely manner about the award and the reasons for the exclusion of their offers.
Procurement Procedures May only be repealed under certain conditions, for example when the prices are excessive or the offers do not correspond to the requirements of the tender.
Different regulations different from each other
In the Czech Republic, the 10-or 10-15-days of information and waiting for the contract to be awarded even in the construction works not to be awarded throughout Europe
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of the EU-wide forgave.
For the rest of the procedures in Germany, tenderers can only be informed of the award after awarding their contract.
A procurement procedure is to be repealed in the Czech Republic if only an offer has been received or only an offer could be counted.
In Germany, the surcharge is also to be granted in the case of only a single value, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economic.
Essential Test results
Brh
In the case of the audited awarding contracts, there was only a few cases when the procurement procedures were concluded
In Part, companies in EU-wide contracts have already received orders before the end of the information deadlines, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In Case of open procedures, orders also contain different content from offer content, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting entities did not hold the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a registry was therefore granted the surcharge on the zweitgünstigste offer, since a company with a 50 % cheaper offer after the end of the award period was no longer ready to perform the services at the originally offered price.
Nku
In the case of a higher education in higher education, the contract of the contract has been published in the contract
For some forgave, for example in the construction of the road bauunterhaltung, in the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting entities closed the contracts after the expiry of the statutory deadline.
In the awarding of construction works for the rehabilitation of former military terrain, the registry led the notice on the awarding of the contract only after the expiry of the statutory deadline to
Summary Findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's rules on the conclusion of the procurement procedure.
The Legal protection of the unsuccessful applicants or tenderers will increase the instruments of the korruptionsvorbeugung.
The scope of the legal protection is also extended in the Czech Republic of Germany to forgave below the eu thresholds.
In both countries, overruns of the deadlines for the order of order have been determined.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the manipulation risk.
The Bauverwaltungen should avoid the identified deficiencies in the conclusion of their procurement procedures in future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting requirements
The procurement procedures are to be documented in detail during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the justifications of the individual decisions.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the orders issued are to be announced.
The orders are also recorded in an eu statistics.
Requirements of eu law as well as the application process through the documentation of the procurement procedures will implement a fundamental requirement of the transparency of transparency.
A carefully and quickly created documentation allows for the traceability of the to.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders at contracts above the eu thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of avoiding corruption, as the compulsion to justify to in detail is significantly more effective.
The notice of a given order for an EU-wide procurement procedure has to transmit the respective application form to the office for official publications of the EU within 48 days.
The office publishes the notices in the official journal of the EU and thus also sets the annual report.
The contracting entities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and to report through the competent National Ministries of the EU commission.
On this basis, the commission prepares an eu statistics that can provide an overview of the development of the single market in the construction works.
Regulations of the German and Czech National Court
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully implemented the eu legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements in national law.
The rules for the documentation and reporting for eu statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different regulations different from each other
In the Czech Republic, the publication for granted orders is limited not only to the EU-wide, but also extends to the rest of the procurement procedures.
The publication deadline is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide grants, there is only a limited number of tenders for limited invitations to tender and for direct grants from 25.000 euro 15.000 euro without VAT (So-called. Ex-post transparency).
Under this contract, as well as in public tenders, only the companies participating in the competition receive information about the auftragserteilungen.
Essential Test results
Brh
Documentation
A variety of the audited procurement procedures was not fully documented.
The awarding endorsements did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of produktvorgaben or references to national regulations.
In a procurement procedure, the registry did not justify why it gave an undertaking to a company, although its offer did not contain any mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting entities did not contain all the documents necessary for the documentation of the procurement
Notices about auftragserteilungen
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting entities failed to make the granting of orders known.
In further procurement procedures, the evidence was missing that the contracting entities had known the orders given.
Reporting and reporting requirements
The statistical statements presented contained the required minimum information. They were created and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited bauverwaltungen published the final results of the completed procurement procedures.
However, due to a change of data, it was not for the publication of this data.
The construction noticed this mistake only after half a year,
So that the orders of the procurement procedures completed until then have not been published.
Nku
Documentation
In the case of construction works for the orientation of a large sporting event, the documentation of the procurement procedures has this was mainly related information, such as false errors in the protocols of the commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Notices about auftragserteilungen
For several commissions, notices of awarded orders were only delayed or not published at all.
Summary Findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly consistent in both countries and are setting up the eu requirements.
The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the procurement procedures, is basically guaranteed.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic to the notice go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The identified deficiencies in the documentation and the notices of the notices significantly increase the orruptionsvorbeugende effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
The Bauverwaltungen should continue to improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and reporting procedures and fully fulfil their reporting and reporting requirements.
Summary Evaluation and recommendations
The Parallel tests of the nku and the brh have focused on two main topics, which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the awarding of works by contracting authorities: the application of the EU procurement and the korruptionsvorbeugung.
The requirements of eu law allow for a cross-border competition to create a European single market.
Corruption preventive measures not only serve to avoid corruption or at least reduce it. They should also avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.
The Audit findings of the two audit on the application of the procurement regulations in both countries, as well as the comparison of these regulations, provide information on similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the development of their award and its application.
Application of the eu financial regulation
The EU's requirements for the awarding of works have implemented both countries in national law.
This means that in the Czech Republic and in Germany there is an important common basis for the awarding of works and taking into account the essential commandments of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The Bauverwaltungen of both countries have partly made these commandments very extensive through other administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements for the works of the EU to be awarded to its national procurement procurement procedures below the eu threshold.
However, the research of the audit has revealed that the bauverwaltungen have not fully complied with the requirements of eu law in all areas.
The construction in Germany should continue to improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to eliminate the identified complaints in implementing the eu requirements.
The tests in the Czech Republic have shown above all dangers that affect the efficiency of the award-giving.
In this way, incomplete specifications made additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, the cost investigation was mostly insufficient. Also reduced excessive qualification requirements are the number of possible bidders and in, especially in the case of the transport.
Korruptionsvorbeugung
The research has not had the goal to uncover corruption,
Also because the audit have no appropriate instruments for this.
However, the audit can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have made arrangements against corruption and manipulation in the awarding of construction works and how these requirements are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities in the field of transport.
The German regulations mainly provide for a largely unlimited competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the korruptionsvorbeugung.
The Czech rules aim above all to increase the transparency of the procedures.
Brh
In Germany, general principles of the federal administration apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the requirements for the awarding of construction works and are geared to their specific needs.
The corresponding regulations are partly determined by the way in which the commandments for the procurement process are taken into account during the process of procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the court of justice, the primacy of the principle of open procedure is particularly important the public tender is an appropriate instrument to significantly reduce the corruption risk in the awarding of construction works. Restrictions on competition, however, increase the risk of anti-competitive interference.
Risk Analysis and sufficient controls (especially the most common-eye principle), the transparency and documentation of the procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective arrangements to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The Brh therefore does not see a fundamental principle of compliance with the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the awarding of works.
The rules for the application of the law are largely taken into account in practice.
The deficiencies identified in sub-areas have shown shortcomings in implementing some requirements.
The school staff should continue to schools their employees to the requirements for school training and make them even more aware of this problem.
An essential part of the complaints was related to tasks that the bauverwaltungen had delegated to freelance workers.
However, without checks and sufficient risk of fraud, the misuse of tasks increases the risk of abuse.
Manipulation and corruption tasks should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against unlawful interference.
Nku
The Czech Republic decided at government level a strategy against corruption, in which the area of public procurement is the most important part.
The Awarding Act as well as the corresponding implementing rules have been substantially changed.
The exams of the nku took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The decided strategy and the new legal provisions should be effective improvements, as the contracting entities justify the cost of the auftragserteilungen, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the type of evaluations and duly document and publish all these aspects must.
Recommendations Recommendations Recommendations Recommendations Recommendations
The nku and the brh evaluate the implementation of EU standards in principle positive.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU commandments of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for the awarding of construction works within the European Union.
The Supranational model implemented in the European Union can also be used as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and cost-effective damage potential through manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction works, both audit have called for the bauverwaltungen in their countries to continue their actions against corruption and manipulation and, if necessary still to improve.
In particular, the organisation and application procedures of the procurement procedures should be continuously investigated for vulnerabilities and risks in order to identify action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of the contracts in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider space for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of loss.
A stronger division of construction works can also have a beneficial impact on the production of goods, provided that a greater competition is achieved with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of the procurement procedures is an essential basis for an efficient awarding of contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialized specialists. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks, with the exception of the transportation projects, take the portfolios themselves or they commissioned by them.
The Audit of both countries have the concern, even after the conclusion of their joint project, that the important findings for them can be found and if necessary. To the parliament and government of your country.
Both audit also believe that the principles of the award and its implementation set out in this report are also of interest at the international level of the international organisation of the Supreme Security Council (Intosai). Because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure an economic award of construction works in a well-functioning and fair competition.
