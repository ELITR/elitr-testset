Public procurement of construction services and corruption prevention
Joint report by the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by public authorities is of great importance to both the state and the economy.
The state has the task of using public funds as economically and economically as possible, as well as ensuring fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by public authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure that competition is largely unrestricted across borders, public authorities must comply with EU rules when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, EU member states must transpose and apply the EU's public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the generally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favours when awarding their contracts.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits both for the award of construction services across the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national legislation, as well as the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction services in construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds have also been included in the discussions with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both auditors are summarised in this joint report.
The report will also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional tests carried out in 2011 / 2012 by the building authorities, which are responsible for the road and construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on test knowledge from 2008 to 2011, which included construction work in road construction, rail infrastructure construction, water construction, construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
The awarding of federal public contracts in Germany is carried out predominantly by the building administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use the state budget.
In both countries, freelance workers are also involved in some areas of procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sector are governed by budgetary law and the administrative rules that are based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national awards, many complementary individual schemes are provided for by internal administrative provisions.
Such as the so-called "public procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or further formulated in accordance with the procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the public procurement law and other statutory provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the use of public funds, allowed greater competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the procurement process.
Broad outlines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure must be applied to EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are to be applied to the national types of contracts (public tender, limited tender, hands-free award), which are broadly in line with the aforementioned EU-wide types of contracts.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for contracts to be carried out across the EU) and the public tender (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender process, any interested company can make an offer.
Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
This is mainly due to the division of an overall construction measure into specialist and partial units.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the above-mentioned features of German public procurement law are proven tools for achieving economic results.
In Germany, there are over 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Volume of public procurement contracts and shares of public procurement in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of these, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction activities of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in construction and road construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and water construction) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction services in the construction and road construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts awarded in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders, and 6.6% negotiation procedures and hands-free tenders.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic in 2011 amounted to 4.7 billion euros, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, representing 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011:65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiation procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for order volumes below the 2.7% threshold for other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement bodies in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant proportion of public contracts, which have a major financial impact on the prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts, and that the open procedure and public tender are of paramount importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries for the award of construction services across the EU and for the prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both auditors compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.
They found that:
The EU directives on the award of construction services by public contractors have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (paragraphs 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which differ in part in their priorities and in their details (No. 3.2).
In both countries, a key requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information needed to make an appropriate offer.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to anti-competitive requirements.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services can be divided into lots in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, the NKÚ found, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction on only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and risk price or other collusion.
Under the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities can, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already contracted additional or amended services, which will prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective benchmarks for determining the type of award were mostly followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary primacy of the open procedure applies to EU-wide awards and public tenders, which are in line with the open procedure for national awards.
This will allow more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price agreements between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects, whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded construction services across Europe.
The true value of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used to determine the cost of public works, in particular in construction.
These are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction services to be awarded across Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published, which should strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adjust to the planned contracts at an early stage.
The audited building authorities generally complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be disclosed beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries should, as often as possible, switch among the companies to be invited when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed guidelines in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, it is in the interest of equal competition to ensure that companies interested in bidding receive the same information during the bidding phase.
A contact between these companies and with freelancers involved in the creation of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited building authorities in Germany did not comply with these requirements in part (No. 4.5).
The opening up of the bids in both countries must take into account in particular the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency.
The requirements for labelling, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to narrow the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.
The tests in both countries yielded few complaints (No. 4.6).
In both countries, the examination and evaluation of the offers are determined by guidelines for the organisation of construction and execution.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, tendering offices handed over offers for testing to third parties without first looking through the offers and sufficiently documenting any abnormalities.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the proposed contract before the award of the contract.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities not comply with the prescribed deadlines when issuing orders, or deviated from the bidders' offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible to the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notices of some procedures.
Some of the deficiencies identified also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The public authorities in both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Foundations of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination and Appeal Directives, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 Member States.
The general tendering principles of the European Union are, in particular, that of competition, equal treatment and non-discrimination, as well as transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for construction projects to be forgiven across the EU.
In order to do so, their expected order totals must reach or exceed the current amount of 5,000,000 euros.
The rules relate in particular to the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the adherence to deadlines, including the receipt of the offers, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of the applicants and the Appeal Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, the companies concerned can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for the private benefit,
This is usually caused by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hamper competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of the world's economic output.
In the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public contractors, anti-competitive agreements or unfair practices can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the basic tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they will have to review the structure and execution of their administrations in areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventative measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works services is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as prejudice and approval - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the Federal Administration. In addition to the risk analysis, the following principles must be observed for the procurement sector: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, the principle of transparency and transparency, the fundamental separation of planning, awarding and settlement, precise and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, other anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
For example, in 2011, the Federal Ministry responsible for awarding contracts in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically assisted control system.
The award data - such as the estimated costs and the amount of orders - as well as information on the freelancers involved will be collected across the board and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, are the most important bases for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has set out anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions 14.
The new legislation essentially includes the following provisions: Lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, requiring the contracting authority to notify the contracts beforehand, including naming the reasons for the tender, prohibiting the restriction of the number of bidders in non-open procedures, and thus abolishing the possibility of bidding through lottery procedures, introducing the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, introducing the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Audit results on the different stages of the procurement process
Award documents
The tender documents must contain all the information the bidders need to make an appropriate offer.
In particular, the award documents must allow for an accurate calculation.
In doing so, the bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the performance description and the terms of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that determine the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law on procurement documents are in particular addressed to technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The performance description must be basically product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the performance description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding anti-competitive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of the offers and for manipulation in their valuation.
German and Czech public procurement rules
The same or similar regulations in both countries have transposed the EU's technical specifications requirements into national law.
The services are basically product-neutral without any factory specifications.
In the performance descriptions, the individual performances must normally be subdivided into performance units with specific quantities.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the performance descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services where it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation based on lump sums or on time expenditure should be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified specifications in the procurement documents.
The performance descriptions must allow bidders to create their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The tender will not be made public until the tender documents have been finalised.
Divergent rules
There is no obligation to tender for construction services in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement offices can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are basically divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and / or by type or subject matter (unskilled).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to increase the number of potential suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is generally considered the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be specified in the procurement documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
The aim is to ensure that applicants are fully and conclusively aware of the criteria for evaluating their offers.
In Germany, the specification of valuation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be set out in an internal administrative award notice.
Procurement documents drawn up by authorised freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or reviewers in Germany in the construction and some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the client's knowledge of the contact with these freelancers.
This is also why freelancers are not allowed to send award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person for the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the awarding of contracts to the already contracted company, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary benefits must not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a closer limit of 20% applies to the award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already contracted company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible under the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, it should be based on the agreed prices and the basis of the price determination of the order already awarded.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small amounts cannot be charged with additional supplementary services.
Key exam results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications - such as graffiti protection, joints or noise protection panels - without the need for them.
In some cases, performance requirements were described in such detail that only one product was eligible.
List of services by subdivision
The BRH has not found any breaches of the bid in any of the audited proceedings to advertise services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the tender documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some cases, the tender documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance directories contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work consisted of almost half of such needs.
Loose and scoring criteria
Many awards lacked the prescribed rationale for why the services, which were mostly advertised to the unskilled, were not further divided into partial ones.
There were no complaints about the criteria to be used in evaluating the offers.
References to freelance workers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover sheets or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of tendering."
In particular, in the construction sector, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints raised mainly to the failures of the freelancers charged with creating the performance descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity to adequately monitor the performance descriptions.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement process for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the performance description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the performance descriptions.
As performance units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of performance descriptions
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance descriptions were changed four times in the period from August to September 2009, as part of a non-open procedure.
As the scope of services had increased significantly and the technical requirements had changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate pre-construction tests and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be commissioned.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior design did not include product quality requirements.
As a result of these missing specifications, some subcontractors built overpriced and unreasonably high quality equipment.
Loose and suitability criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction activities into partial or partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring revealed that if selected parts were to be allocated separately, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible at a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, in six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved in the case of a separate award.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be allocated separately, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When it came to the award of construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority set out very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders in an open process to demonstrate, among other things, at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth 28 million euros over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, no more than nine providers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another part of a motorway included six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had set an annual construction volume of at least €480 million over the last three years as a criterion of suitability for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) came from commissions from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even just one bidder made an offer.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the case of the construction of a car bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures to the award of additional services in two cases, nor did it enter into written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, submissions in the first case amounted to up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their need for the award was already known.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original value of the contract laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without notice.
In the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiations without a tender.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
Based on a sampling of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Building and Construction.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and corruption prevention.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and create their offers in an appropriate manner.
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon afterwards and also reduce the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the procurement documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and opportunities for manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for describing performance have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The existing bid for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the awarding of extensive services without lots or with very large lots can result in restrictions on the supplier field to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that smaller and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other collusion.
When awarding and remunerating additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
According to EU and German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded with public notice under certain conditions without procurement procedures.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation process without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
As the scope of public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Define the type of award and take into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by imposing non-public procurement procedures.
Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied to construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European legal requirements for competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, construction services are generally to be awarded across Europe in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A single construction project must not be divided into individual measures without a compelling reason, or deliberately valued at too low a cost, in order to avoid the obligation to award construction services across Europe as a matter of principle.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award as well as the examination of the application obligation of the EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU rules on procurement procedures and thresholds into national law.
Divergent rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equivalence of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be doctored or substantiated, while other procedures are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure, or - in the case of national awards - the public tender procedure, in principle, takes precedence, as defined by budgetary and public procurement law and by the anti-corruption guidelines.
Other types of tendering - such as the non-open procedure or the limited tendering procedure - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finalised in the procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying certain bidders and to make possible price agreements between bidders more difficult.
The principle of public tendering is a key element in preventing corruption in Germany.
The true value of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
Construction services in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases from public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. Among other things, the databases contain cost indicators for building categories, use units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected order value of a planned project or construction work to be awarded can be determined.
In Germany, the corresponding cost databases for road construction have only been provided by a number of building authorities.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Procurement offices in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price surveys of comparable construction projects to determine the estimated cost of construction services.
On the contrary, in most cases, the cost investigations are based on estimates of the funding body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
The relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials as part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The purpose of this database is to collect information on material expenditure and construction and construction works, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable cost investigations and provisions of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a collection of data for construction projects to improve cost control.
Which will serve as a benchmark for the price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key exam results BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited public procurement bodies wrote out the works largely in open procedures or in public tenders, following the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services in the construction sector were advertised publicly or in open procedures.
In road construction, this figure was 94.8%.
In the election of non-public tenders, there was a lack of detailed reasons why the tenders had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional investigation, based on more than 16,000 tendering procedures, the BRH found that non-public tenders have significant competitive disadvantages over open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In construction, more than twice as many bids were submitted for public tenders as for limited tenders and almost three times as many bids as for hands-free tenders.
The investigation also found that, on average, bidding prices for limited tenders and hands-free tenders were 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Buildings and a National Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public tenders.
As a result of its research into economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Building and Construction even found that there were twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of the construction projects, for which they had identified a projected total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually set out procurement plans in which they set out the construction services to be awarded in accordance with EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of construction services were to be awarded across the EU.
It was impossible to see how the commitment to EU-wide contracts could be circumvented by overly low cost estimates.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum proportion of EU procurement procedures actually fell.
During the construction process, a number of tendering offices improperly changed the terms of their tendering plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was still being complied with.
For most of the construction measures audited, the proportion of EU-wide contracts was usually lower than foreseen under the procurement plan, according to the settlement results.
In some cases, tenders for construction projects above the EU threshold were in breach of the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more comprehensive individual lots in EU-wide procedures.
And instead, they chose national procedures.
NKÚ
Choice of award type
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several subcontracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
Through these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated value of the order
In road construction, the existing price databases in this area were only an insufficient tool to determine the expected order values.
The data were based on construction projects that had just been completed, but where there was evidence of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance or excessive profits by the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the expected order values determined by the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In construction, the expected order values were based on cost estimates estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.
Actual order values deviated sharply from estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the value of the contract agreed later, but eight submissions in the course of construction led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros, or 27%.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
In the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, the costs increased disproportionately by 139%, as the area of use had only expanded by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU rules for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold into national law, which is why the respective regulations are broadly in line.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procurement procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the field of application by manipulation-prone stipulations of the client and by making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, the contracting authorities can award contracts in open or non-open procedures.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings involving previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender procedure. In the Czech Republic, some services have been inadvertently distributed in order to avoid the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When considering the EU threshold, errors had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a fall in the minimum proportion of services advertised across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected cost of construction services and construction projects.
The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure through further checks that the requirements for the choice of the type of contract and the scope of services to be advertised across the EU are met or that the prerequisites for accurate cost investigations are created.
Advance information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded across Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies of the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information is intended to contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total value of the contract reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the supply periods of open or unopen procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of performance, the process and execution dates, the special requirements and the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardised throughout Europe, must be used.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the client.
In order to prevent the disadvantage of foreign interested parties, notices at national level must not contain any additional information and must not be published until after sending the notice to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU's pre-information and disclosure requirements into national law.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published for construction services not to be awarded across Europe.
Procurement procedures may start at the earliest one month after the sending of advance information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the National Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of prior information be dispensed with.
In Germany, there is no need for prior information in the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national tendering procedures, announcements for public tenders and contests must be published before limited tenders on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of limited tenders without competition, announcements of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is particularly important because of the small size of the loose building contracts.
In the Czech Republic, the impact of this scheme is limited, as there are significantly fewer works being divided into lots.
Key exam results
BRH
Background information
The surveyed procurement offices published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded across Europe.
In some open cases, however, they shortened the offer periods, although the 52-day period required between the sending of the advance information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were tendered only after the 12-month period of prior information had already expired and before it was extended.
In the case of many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcements
The notices of the audited bodies contained in part CPV codes, which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, announcements at national level were published earlier or contained more information - for example, on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex ante transparency
The contracting offices of an audited building authority had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
The company published the messages on its own paid procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had also forwarded the notifications to the federal internet portal, which is free of charge, as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited administration's reports were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Announcements
When building a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction on the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the tendering procedure, according to which it would evaluate the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it would allow to compete.
The award office concluded in its assessment that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the award office was not transparent because it had not disclosed details of the qualification criteria and the evaluation process at any point in the process.
Publication of the notices
In the renovation of the former military site, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information and communication system is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide awards, strengthening competition and preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU rules and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
In contrast to public procurement procedures, in the case of non-public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance of which companies should be invited to tender.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU rules allow for a limit on the number of applicants for EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies are required to submit bids.
At least three companies will be invited to negotiate with the tender notice.
In any case, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be disclosed beforehand.
The selection of companies to be called upon is a process within the procurement process that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be unilaterally preferred.
In addition, restricting competition to a small number of companies also encourages potential collusion between candidates.
In both cases, the result can be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
The rules governing the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the award offices should change as often as possible among the companies to be asked for when selecting candidates.
Nor should competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The award offices have to justify the selection of candidates and document the process of the selection process in their award notices.
Divergent rules
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three candidates are required to submit bids, and in the case of hands-free tenders, several suitable candidates are required to submit bids.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the choice of companies must be based on the multi-eye principle.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public tendering process, the management level of the construction service or a contractor from the contracting authority will generally have to amend this proposal by removing, for example, a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
This is to prevent a single person from being able to finalise the circle of companies to participate in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching collusion among the parties involved.
The list of companies to be asked to do so must be kept confidential and not made available to the general public, even to freelancers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations on the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be called upon, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory loophole in Czech legislation.
Key exam results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to bid for non-public contracts was met with a few exceptions.
An analysis of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in the construction sector showed that the contracting authorities asked an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids for limited federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 for hands-free contracts.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with few providers, the award offices did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
In particular, they took into account companies already known to them and, in their view, tried and tested.
As a result, they said they would have to ensure the suitability of the companies to compete in non-public proceedings before the call for an offer was made.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction on regional bidders in the non-public tendering procedures, but a higher proportion of regional companies than in public tenders.
This was mainly attributable to the fact that, on average, the performance of non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than public tenders.
More Eye Principle and Proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to allow an independent person to amend the proposed list of companies to be asked to do so.
In particular, they justified this with a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies required to make the offer.
A number of samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the applicant lists and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
As a result, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidding lists
At a public procurement office, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or authorised companies could have been passed on unauthorised and, for example, they could have colluded.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders received no information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of admitted companies.
The award committee then proceeded with a process to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle acceptable at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyed principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole power of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be asked to do so, the German regulations restrict such opportunities for abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, in particular, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been poorly implemented and that the potential for manipulation in these cases has not been sufficiently reduced for abusive restrictions on the field of participants.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the call for tender, the offer phase begins, in which the companies can make offers on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their offers by the end of the deadline set by the award office.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement process.
The contracting authorities will have to comply with the national regulations aimed at countering the potential for manipulation during the supply phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
The procurement documents, on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their offers, are only to be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award process are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the tender phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the procurement documents or other questions relating to the tender process, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers charged with drawing up the award documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the contracted freelancers and the applicants must be avoided.
Freelance workers must not become a hub of the awarding process, through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Offers sent by post or directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have technical encryption.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the contracting authority can also order external service companies to print and send the procurement documents, whose employees are required to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
The offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp in Germany and sent directly, immediately and unopened to an officer responsible for the custody.
This employee must not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt data in a protocol.
The custody of the offers is not specified in the Czech Republic.
Key exam results
BRH
The bidding phase tests focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building management company.
Dispatch of procurement documents
The contracting offices of the audited building management sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelance workers did not send procurement documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building management mostly failed to comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding when naming the contact persons for inquiries and information.
Contrary to the specifications, in the performance descriptions, she did not specify employees from the contracting office, but from the project management as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even included the names of freelancers who had created the performance descriptions.
In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information when making enquiries during the offer phase.
Labelling of offers
At the audited building management, all offers received were marked with an entrance stamp and an entrance note.
In some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the preconditions for preventing corruption.
Keeping the offers
After their identification, not all offers were immediately and immediately sent to the custody officer, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which each employee had access.
Another office had hung a mailbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, and some of the offers that had been submitted there remained overnight.
Since the throw-in slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to take out offers received and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
NKÚ
On the Czech side, no defects were reported.
Summary findings
During the bidding phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be avoided in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.
The rules governing the receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers appear appropriate to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed breaches of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of bids
Opening of bids
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and made known.
From the opening date, the bidders will be bound by their bids until the deadline set by the award office expires.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU rules governing the opening of bids.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement process, the national anti-corruption rules contain extensive provisions to protect bids and competition.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the opening of the offer are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the award office.
The multi-eye principle is designed to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers uncontrollably when opening up the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can take part in the opening date.
Only offers which were submitted to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are allowed to open.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the bid must be recorded in a protocol, including the names of the bidders and the offer prices.
The protocol is to be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of the bids.
Freelance workers can also participate.
The committee can also be tasked with further stages of the procurement process, such as the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary are conducting the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an employee of the tender body.
The negotiator and the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the awarding and processing of contracts.
According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, the minutes of the opening date also contain information about discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or delayed offers.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's signature authority are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to those directly responsible for processing them.
Czech regulations do not exist.
If a tender procedure in the Czech Republic involves only one offer, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If there is only one offer, it has to be opened and then evaluated.
Key exam results
BRH
More Eye Principle
At the opening dates, the audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries, who were not charged with any other contracts.
However, in the case of hands-free contracts with a smaller scope of services, there were isolated cases where freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late bids were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of offers
The award offices examined in the cross-sectional review identified the offers in accordance with the specifications by perforating them with the date of the opening date.
Inadequate labelling has been found in the case of prolonged audits of some beneficiaries.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practices after the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer deadline
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was received only one month after the end of the offer period at the award office, but the award office accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The rules governing the opening of bids in both countries are broadly consistent, taking into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency, which can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening up of bids.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the process as well as for the labelling, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict the possibility of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those responsible for opening up the offers are not allowed to carry out any other tasks related to the service to be awarded.
All in all, only a few complaints demonstrate the high acceptance of the requirements for opening up the offer.
Review and evaluation of offers
The client must examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, he has to determine the offer for the award of the award, which best meets the requirements according to the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders has to be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The bids of the non-excluded bidders must be examined in a computational, technical and economic manner and evaluated on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer, and the client has to examine offers with unusually low prices in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly susceptible phase of the tendering process.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the value result can be inadvertently impaired and thus prevented from finding the most economically advantageous offer.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the audit and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
In line with EU requirements, bids in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the suitability of the companies to be presented, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting, are set out in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the process.
After checking the bidding appropriation, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used when evaluating the bids.
The rating must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined immediately as to whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the valuation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken in the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to those directly responsible for processing them.
The review of the offers and the computational examination of the offers may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It only has to employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they have to treat the offers confidentially.
They can only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be set up to examine and evaluate the offers.
The committees produce valuation reports with award proposals.
In the end, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If the proof or explanation required to submit an offer in Germany is only incomplete, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the expiry of the deadline can the offer be excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives the bidders the opportunity to complete a lack of evidence or explanation.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers have to be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to clear up these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so, and if the contracting authority can provide proof of a miscalculation of prices, this offer is excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Offers with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
If one or more offers fall short of the correct price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders have to prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority can exclude the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders can be rescinded after an audit of profitability, if only offers with unjustifiable prices are available at low prices.
In contrast to German public procurement law, for this reason, the contract cannot be refused for offers with prices significantly higher than the client's calculation.
If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its supervisory authority.
The Commission has to decide what measures to take and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
The specialist supervisor at the top level, for example, also has to agree to more than 50,000 euros for construction work if the contract is to be awarded by hand, if a contract is not to be awarded for the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key exam results
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the audited tendering procedures were in line with the requirements set out above.
In some of the companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A beneficiary contracted companies without the required proof of suitability.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the award office had taken into account all the award criteria made known in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "prize" criterion.
Selection of people involved and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to examine the offers.
For example, freelance workers or employees involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be carried out by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, employees who were not required to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations were also involved in the examination of the offers.
In most cases, it was not clear to the construction services whether the offers were available to the freelance workers only to those directly responsible for the processing.
Review and audit of offers
A number of award offices handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and having doctored their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the documents examined, some of the abnormalities or lack of price or product information were not or only insufficiently marked.
Economic Impact Assessments
For a sample in a building administration, the cheapest offers for three-quarters of the audited tendering procedures deviated more than 10% from the previously estimated costs.
Every twentieth award procedure has been cancelled due to unreasonable offer prices.
Not all bidding tests and enlightenment discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed information was lacking, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
In many cases, the discrepancies were only justified on a blanket basis, for example by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
The building services said that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed-use calculations.
In the case of a public service tender, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously estimated value of these services.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a briefing, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then contracted company.
As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the contracted company as a "low-cost company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction service awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
It did not lift the call for tenders, citing the non-factual reason that this company could be closed to a reasonable calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
There have been two cases of irregularities in an audited building administration, both of which have been reported to the supervisor level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders in a tender was identical, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the process.
When applying the other rules, the tests did not raise any significant objections.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
In many of the audited construction projects, including higher education, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the process, even though they did not meet the requirements set out in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.
Rating
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the given criteria for evaluating and evaluating the offers.
In the case of a construction project to expand the rail network, the award office did not determine the weighting of the evaluation criteria until the start of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the shortening offered was not sufficiently taken into account by the second and third position bidders.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures within the framework of housing development, the contracting authority did not document the criteria it applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
In the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The rules for testing and evaluating offers in both countries are in line with EU requirements.
However, with regard to the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ.
In Germany, the procedure is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eye principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the specifications, on the basis of which the adequacy of the offered prices must be examined.
In both countries, some of the audited tendering procedures found that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or were not sufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of audit and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are encouraged.
A particularly serious deficiency was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulation in further proceedings.
If contracting authorities are to carry out tasks in the examination and evaluation of the offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased amount of control are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the set instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly in the aptitude test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After checking and evaluating the offers, the award procedure is completed by granting the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
The companies have the option to examine the intended award within 10 days, or for other means of communication within 15 days, in the event of information being provided electronically or by fax, and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder requests a review within the information period, the conclusion of the contract is only possible after the final decision in the review process.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is designed to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the client to comply with the procurement law throughout the procurement process.
In order to do this, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client is to place the order within the announced deadline,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client must not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The defeated bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account.
Tendering procedures may only be lifted under certain conditions, for example if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, there is a 10-day or 15-day obligation to provide information and to wait before awarding the contract, even for construction services not to be awarded across Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to EU-wide contracts.
In the case of the other proceedings in Germany, the bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be lifted if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been assessed.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the terms of the tender and is economical.
Key exam results
BRH
In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may lead to the ineffectiveness of the contract.
Also, according to open procedures, order letters contained content that deviated from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the clients did not comply with the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to carry out the services at the originally offered price after the end of the contract period.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
In some contracts, for example in the construction of road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the legal deadline.
When awarding construction services for the redevelopment of the former military site, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award to all bidders after the expiry of the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements to complete the procurement process.
The legal protection of the defeated candidates or bidders will increase the tools for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, the building authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified when concluding their tendering procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency offer.
A carefully and promptly produced documentation makes it possible to trace the award decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders for contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to explain procurement decisions in detail significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, which also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report it to the EU Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission draws up an annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
German and Czech public procurement rules
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU's documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are broadly the same in both countries.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is reduced to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide contracts, there is a duty to publish only in the case of limited tenders and in the case of hands-free contracts with value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure will receive information about the orders.
Key exam results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, although its offer did not include mandatory proof.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements of orders
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to disclose the award of contracts.
In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had disclosed the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical records reviewed contained the minimum required information, which had been prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, due to a transmission error, this data was not published by a building management company.
The building management only noticed this error after half a year,
As a result, the order data of the procurement procedures that had been completed up to then were not published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction work for the hosting of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed significant shortcomings, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the valuation commissions.
In addition, some of the protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements of orders
In the case of several road construction projects, announcements about contracts awarded were only delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting requirements are broadly consistent in both countries and are in line with EU requirements.
The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The deficiencies identified in the documentation and in the notices significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and orders and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
Parallel audits by the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two main areas that are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of construction services by public authorities: The application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only designed to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit expertise of the two auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these rules, reveal similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in developing their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU's requirements for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and in Germany, there is an important common basis for awarding construction services and taking into account the essential bids of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The building authorities in both countries have in some cases been very supportive of these bids through further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has also largely transferred the requirements for the construction services to be awarded across the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the auditors' investigations have shown that the building services have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should continue to improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to resolve the complaints raised when implementing the EU requirements.
The tests in the Czech Republic have shown, in particular, dangers that affect the profitability of the contracts.
For example, incomplete performance descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation, and cost assessments were often inadequate, and excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and, in particular, restricted competition in the transport sector.
Prevention of corruption
The investigation did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,
Also because the auditors do not have the tools to do so.
However, the auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the awarding of works and how these requirements are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities for preventing corruption.
In particular, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition, as well as transparency and controls as key elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are mainly aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared towards their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations set out very precisely how the bids to prevent corruption should be taken into account in the course of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
According to the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is an appropriate tool to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the awarding of construction services, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulation.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not see any need for fundamental changes to the relevant requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the requirements.
The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the anti-corruption guidelines and make them even more aware of this issue.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelance workers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against unlawful interference.
NKÚ
The Czech Republic has adopted a strategy against corruption at government level, in which public procurement is the most important component.
The procurement law and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The NKÚ audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, as the contracting authorities will have to justify the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential assessment criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU guidelines.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's bids for competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both auditors are calling on the building authorities in their countries to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously investigated for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
In addition, a greater division of construction services into lots can have a favourable effect on supply prices, provided it achieves greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient contracting by public authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building services, whereas in the Czech Republic, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or contractors appointed by them.
The auditors of both countries are anxious, even after the completion of their joint project, to develop the relevant findings and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings outlined are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
