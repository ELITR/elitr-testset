Public procurement of building services and prevention of corruption
Joint report by the supreme control office of the Czech Republic (nkú) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance for both the state and the economy.
The state has the task of using public funds as economically and economically as possible and of ensuring fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure that competition is largely unrestricted across borders, contracting authorities have to comply with EU requirements for their contracts from certain value limits (threshold values).
To this end, EU Member States have to transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Because of the generally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue advantages in the award of their contracts.
In January 2011, the supreme control office of the Czech Republic (nkú) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits for both the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
The tests focused on the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national legislation, as well as on the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in building construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds have also been included in the considerations with regard to the prevention of corruption.
The audit results of both courts of auditors are summarised in this joint report.
The report should also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional examinations, which he carried out in 2011 / 2012 with the building authorities, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluation of the audit findings from 2008 to 2011, which included construction measures in road construction, railway infrastructure, water construction, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.), as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is mainly carried out by the building authorities of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the area of transport infrastructure.
In the construction sector, the awarding of contracts is carried out in a decentralised manner by those who use the state budget.
In both countries, freelancers will also be involved in some of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Establishment of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by the budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national awards, many additional individual regulations are provided for by internal administrative provisions,
Such as the so-called "Gaelic treatment books" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in accordance with the jurisprudence of the public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other statutory provisions, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The Public Procurement Law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the use of public funds, allowed for greater competition and limited the scope for corruption in the award procedure.
Principles of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure are to be applied in the case of EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are subject to the national types of award (public tender, limited tender, hands-free tender), which largely correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide types of award.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (in the case of EU-wide contracts) and the public tender (in the case of national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender procedure, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.
The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction project into technical and partial ones.
The individual awarding of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception is the simplified procedure, which allows a less stringent procedure to be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in accordance with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 are companies with 20 or more employees.
Volume of public contracts and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The federal government's construction volume in building construction and road construction (excluding rail infrastructure and Hydraulic Engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
In 2011, the volume of contracts for construction services in the federal building and highway construction sector was distributed among the types of contracts as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% open procedures and limited tenders, and 6.6% negotiated procedures and hands-on contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide contracts.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was 7.8 billion euros, representing 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiation procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contract volume below the 2.7% threshold other procedures
The data refers to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement agencies in 2011.
The above data shows that the parallel audits of both countries are aimed at a significant part of public contracts, which have a major financial impact on the prevention of corruption, which is to be observed in all contracts, and which have a prominent place in the award of contracts due to the open procedure and the public tender.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The supreme control office of the Czech Republic (nkú) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on corruption prevention.
In this context, the working groups of both audit bodies compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany, as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
In doing so, they noted in essence:
The EU directives on the award of construction services by public authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also served by the procurement rules of both countries, which differ in their priorities and in their details (No. 3.2).
In both countries, a key requirement for procurement documents is that they must contain all the information needed to properly prepare bids.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not be subject to competitive restrictions.
In Germany, the Procurement Documents have largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, building services are to be divided as much as possible into lots in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
The ncú found during its tests, particularly in the field of road construction, that the awarding of large-scale services without lots or with very large lots can affect competition and result in a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and risk price or other collusion.
Under the terms of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already commissioned additional or modified services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were mostly followed in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities can choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, applies.
This will allow more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price-fixing between bidders and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total order values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost data banks are used for the cost calculations of public buildings, particularly in the construction sector,
Which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published, which is intended to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to prepare for the planned contracts at an early stage.
The audited building authorities generally complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries should change as often as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting applicants.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interest of fair competition, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in submitting bids receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In order to avoid anti-competitive collusion, contact between these companies and with freelancers involved in the preparation of the service description is to be avoided as far as possible.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited building authorities in Germany did not comply with these requirements in part (No. 4.5).
When opening up the offers in both countries, particular attention must be paid to the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency.
The requirements for the labelling, documentation, storage and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.
The tests in both countries made few complaints (no. 4.6).
In both countries, the examination and evaluation of the offers are determined by guidelines for the organisation of the structure and the organisation of the agreements.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over offers for testing to third parties without having to look through the offers beforehand and to document any anomalies sufficiently.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the intended contract before award.
This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to comply with the specified deadlines or deviate from the bidders "offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible with the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Foundations of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the award Coordination and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 Member States.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, the competition law, the equal treatment law and the ban on discrimination, as well as the transparency requirement.
In order to achieve these objectives, the procurement coordination directive sets out specific rules for construction projects to be awarded throughout the EU.
In order to do so, their estimated order amounts must currently reach or exceed 5,000,000 Euros.
The rules relate in particular to the content of the procurement documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, including for the receipt of bids, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of the applicants and the Remedies Directive form the basis for the legal protection of the applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible infringements of public procurement law, the companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
Which is usually prompted by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of the world's economic output.
For the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question the trust in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they will have to review the structure and organisation of their administrations for areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption, in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Anti-corruption measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery, as well as taking advantage of and approving benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the federal government has issued a directive and recommendations on the Prevention of Corruption 12 in the federal administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be observed for the award area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, more-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, award and settlement, accurate and complete documentation of the award procedures.
In addition, other anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into public procurement legislation.
In 2011, for example, the Federal Ministry responsible for the award of contracts in the area of federal highways introduced an electronic control system,
With the gag data - such as the estimated costs and the order amounts - as well as information on the involved freelancers are collected and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, are the most important foundations of the prevention of corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national public procurement law and related administrative provisions 14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are: lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, requiring the contracting authority to notify the tender in advance, including the reasons for the tender, prohibiting the restriction of the number of tenderers in non-open procedures and thus abolishing the possibility of selecting bidders by lottery, introducing the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, introducing the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the individual stages of the award procedure
Procurement Documents
Procurement Documents the procurement documents must contain all the information that bidders need to make an appropriate bid.
In particular, the procurement documents must allow for an accurate calculation.
In doing so, bidders must not be given risks that cannot be calculated for them.
The Procurement Documents consist in particular of the performance description and the terms and conditions of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements to prove the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for the Procurement Documents are in particular related to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The performance description must be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the performance description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding restrictive requirements in the Procurement Documents is also a fundamental principle of the prevention of corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of bids and for manipulation of their valuation.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
Similar or similar regulations in both countries have been transposed into national law by EU legislation on technical specifications.
The services are, in principle, product-neutral without any factory specifications.
In the performance descriptions, the individual services must generally be subdivided into performance units with respective quantities.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. euro per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the performance descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services that do not determine whether they are needed.
Compensation based on flat rates or on time spent is to be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified specifications in the Procurement Documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The tender will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Diverging regulations
There is no obligation in the Czech Republic to tender for construction works in lots.
If it is possible according to the type of performance to be applied, the public procurement agencies can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, building services are generally divided into lots, separated by the quantity (partial) and / or by type or subject (unskilled).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to expand the number of potential suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be specified in the procurement documents, both in the EU-wide and in the national procedures.
The aim is to make it completely and conclusively clear to applicants which criteria are to be used to evaluate their offers.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria are to be recorded only in an administrative award note.
Procurement documents drawn up by authorised professionals may not contain references to these offices or involved planners or surveyors in Germany from the civil engineering and some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client about contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelance procurement documents are not allowed to be sent out or to interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person for the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of subpoenas to the company already commissioned, without having to carry out a public procurement procedure.
In accordance with EU requirements and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services must not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services cannot be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to the award without a public announcement.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If additional services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the Contractor is in principle not possible under the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed must be taken as a starting point.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be charged with additional supplementary services.
Key test results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by pan-European standards.
Some performance descriptions also included product-related specifications - for example for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels - without this being required.
In some cases, performance requirements were described in such detail that only one product was eligible.
Lists of services subdivided according to partial services
In none of the cases examined, the BRH has found breaches of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some cases, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as positions or deadlines had changed in some cases.
In some cases, the performance indexes contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted almost half of such needs.
Lots and valuation criteria
For many of the awards, the prescribed reason for not dividing the Services, which were mostly advertised after the absence of specialists, into partial ones, was missing.
There were no complaints about the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the performance descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the cover pages or in accompanying plans or reports.
In one case, the awarding authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender."
In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the above-mentioned complaints mainly to the failings of the freelancers responsible for producing the performance descriptions.
The construction services pointed to the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
Nkú
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender for the public procurement of the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units were specified in the performance description as a supplier and a specific product brand.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the services required in the specifications.
As power units, it merely stated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the course of the construction of a motorway bypass, the specifications of services were changed four times during the period from August to September 2009,
Since the scope of services had considerably increased and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings included inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary structural studies and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the Interior did not include product quality requirements.
As a result of this lack of specifications, some subcontractors built overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.
Lots and aptitude criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that, if selected parts were awarded separately, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible with a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, six different buildings, which were the subject of a single contract, could have saved 2.5 million euros (25%) in a separate award.
If the construction of 20 bridges were to be awarded separately, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as aptitude criteria.
In the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders in an open procedure to prove, among other things, at least three road construction projects carried out, worth 28 million euros each over the past five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.
The public award of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least 480 million euros over the past three years as a criterion of suitability for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds spent on road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion Euros out of a total of 3.7 billion Euros) were contracted by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one bidder made an offer.
The ncú showed that narrowing the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the procedures required by law when awarding additional services in two cases, nor did it enter into written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, supplements were generated in the first case of up to 63.7 million Euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million Euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
In the case of several university buildings, some of the services were not listed in the award documents, although the necessity of the award was already known.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original value of the contract laid down in the national public procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without a tender notice.
In the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction work in negotiation proceedings without a tender.
During the construction period, the contracting authority extended the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The uniform prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a sampling of construction projects, the nkú found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Germany, on the other hand, according to an analysis of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take account of EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient certainty of the performance descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and draw up their offers in an appropriate manner,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed upon subsequently and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the Procurement Documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by the publication of the evaluation criteria in the non-EU procurement procedures.
The performance description requirements have been largely met in both countries.
In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations that may have led to restrictions on competition.
The German Law on the formation of lots promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the ncú's audit findings, the award of large-scale services without loosely or with very large loose restrictions on the number of suppliers can result in only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow circle of suppliers and that smaller and medium-sized companies are not allowed to compete.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other collusion.
In the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ.
According to EU requirements and German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without public procurement procedures.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20%, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation process without notice.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
This limit is often exceeded,
Because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently defined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely uncapped, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by imposing non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures are to be applied.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must, in particular, take into account the European laws on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 Euros, the construction services are to be awarded throughout Europe in accordance with open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and award works in national procurement contracts, provided that the estimated value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and that the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total value of all construction contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to avoid the obligation to award construction services on a Europe-wide basis.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award, as well as the examination of the application of the EU procurement rules, are important elements of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Diverging regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and non-open proceedings, without the decision to grant or justify it. However, other proceedings are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or, in the case of national awards, the public tender, as a matter of principle, takes precedence. This is laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the anti-corruption directives.
Other types of award - as well as the non-open procedure or the limited tendering procedure - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by the definition of certain bidders and to make possible price agreements between the bidders more difficult.
The principle of public tender is a central element in the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimate of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost data banks of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public building construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost indicators for building categories, usage units, components or individual building services.
On the basis of such cost indicators, the expected order value of a planned project or a construction performance to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost data banks for road construction have only a few building authorities in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all Road Administration is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price surveys of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated cost of construction services.
In most cases, the cost calculations are based on the estimates of the financing body or on the amount of the funds made available to the building services.
Measures to standardise cost-sharing procedures are still in their infancy.
Within the framework of the Anti-Corruption Plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
This database is intended to collect information on material costs and construction and expansion trades, as well as other cost-relevant data, in order to enable cost calculations and the provisions of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a collection of data on construction projects for better cost control,
Which will serve as a benchmark when setting prices in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key test results BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The audited contracting authorities wrote out the construction work largely in the open procedure or in public tender and thus followed the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction services in the building sector were advertised in public or in open proceedings.
In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.
When choosing non-public types of award, there was a lack of detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that the non-public types of contracts have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In the construction sector, more than twice as many bids were submitted for public tenders as for limited tenders and almost three times as many bids as for hands-free tenders.
The investigation also found that, on average, BID prices were 6% and 10% higher for limited tenders and hands-free tenders than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a State Court of Auditors confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public types of contracts.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
For the construction projects for which they had calculated an estimated total contract value of more than 5,000,000 Euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans in which they determined the construction works to be awarded according to EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the award plans, this meant that more than 80% of the construction work had to be awarded across the EU.
It was not possible to establish a circumvention of the obligation to spend on EU-wide contracts by means of cost estimates that were too low.
However, partly as a result of erroneous calculations, the minimum share of EU procurement procedures was actually lower.
During the construction, some contracting authorities improperly changed the stipulations of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures was still respected.
For most of the construction projects tested, the share of EU-wide tenders was usually lower than foreseen under the tender plan, according to the settlement results.
In some cases, in construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities breached the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more comprehensive individual lots in EU-wide procedures,
And chose national procedures instead.
Nkú
Choice of the type of award
In the case of several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several sub-orders, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were insufficient to determine the expected order values.
The data was based on just completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the commissioned companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined with the help of the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increases in the construction sector.
In building construction, the expected order values were based on the cost values estimated by the project architects or on the estimates of the investors.
The actual order values deviated strongly from the estimated values.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice the value of the Order agreed later, but eight additions in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million Euros and 27%, respectively.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, offer prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. When building a justice building, the cost rose disproportionately to 139%, as the floor space had only expanded by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU rules on how to award and how to take account of the EU threshold into national law, which is why the respective rules are broadly in line.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the rules in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and the most economic results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by ensuring that the applicant field is not restricted by the client's stipulations, which are susceptible to manipulation, and that price agreements between the bidders are made more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
According to Czech legislation, the contracting authorities can award contracts in open or non-open proceedings.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings involving previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been unacceptably divided in order to avoid the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When considering the EU threshold, errors had to be found in Germany, which resulted in a fall in the minimum share of services advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to properly determine the likely costs of construction work and construction projects.
The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure by means of further checks that the requirements for the choice of the type of award as well as the scope of services to be covered by the EU are complied with or that the conditions for accurate cost assessments are created.
Advance information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public contractor has to inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for a Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential public procurement data on the planned construction projects.
They are required for construction projects where the estimated total value of the contract reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In notices, the client must provide binding details of the construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
The vocabulary of Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardised across Europe, must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
Preliminary information and notices will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer's profile.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices at national level must not contain any additional information and must not be published until the publication text has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully implemented the EU legal requirements for advance information and notice into national law.
Diverging regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements are to be published, even in the case of construction works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may be started at the earliest one month after sending the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the National Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a preliminary information be dispensed with.
In Germany, no prior information is required for non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and competitions must be published on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines before restricted tenders.
In the case of restricted tenders without competition, announcements of the services to be awarded are required from 25,000 euros (ex ante transparency).
In the preliminary information, all planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the smallness of the loose building contracts.
In the Czech Republic, this arrangement has only a small impact, as much less construction work is divided into lots.
Key test results
BRH
Preliminary information
The surveyed gassing companies published preliminary information on all tested construction projects with construction services to be distributed throughout Europe.
In some open proceedings, however, they shortened offer periods, although the 52-day period required between the advance information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the 12-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.
In many published preliminary information, there was no indication of the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcements
The notices of the audited bodies contained in Part CPV codes, which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information - for example on implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited Building Authority had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
The latter published the reports on its own fee-based procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the free Internet portal of the federal government, as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the reports from the audited administration were published on this portal.
Nkú
Announcements
When constructing a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The registry could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was allowed under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure that it would evaluate the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it would allow to compete.
The awarding authority concluded that all six candidates met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from further proceedings.
The procedure of the awarding authority was not transparent because it had not disclosed details of the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of the notices
During the renovation of the former military site, the registry did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage education system, with pre-information and notice, is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public contracts
In contrast to the public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can compete in the non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must first make a selection of which companies should be invited to tender.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption the EU rules allow a limitation of the number of applicants in the EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-open procedures, however, at least five companies are required to submit bids.
At least three companies are to be invited to negotiate with a contract notice.
In any case, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the award procedure, which is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be preferred unilaterally.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also encourages possible collusion among applicants.
In both cases, the delivery result can be significantly affected at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this process step.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
The same or similar rules
The rules governing the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should change as often as possible among the companies to be asked for when selecting applicants.
Nor should competition be limited to companies based in certain regions.
The contracting authorities have to justify the selection of candidates and document the course of the selection process in their contracting documents.
Diverging regulations
In Germany, in the case of limited tenders, at least three candidates must be invited to submit bids, and in the case of free-handed tenders, several suitable candidates must be invited to submit bids.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is not permitted to restrict the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction authority or an agent from the contracting authority will usually have to amend this proposal by removing, for example, a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to determine the final circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for wide-ranging collusion among the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested is to be treated confidentially and not to be made generally accessible, even to freelancers.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no rules for the establishment and secrecy of applicant lists.
Under the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be charged, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation on this.
Key test results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts has been met with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in civil engineering revealed that the contracting authorities required an average of 6.6 companies to submit tenders for limited federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies to submit tenders for free-handed contracts.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
In particular, in the case of trades with few suppliers, the contracting authorities did not always change the number of selected applicants.
In particular, they took into account companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they must ensure the suitability of the companies required to compete before the invitation to submit an offer.
The BRH did not find an illegal restriction on regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services for non-public procurement procedures is on average considerably lower and therefore, for example, longer journeys are more important than for public tenders.
More-eyes principle and proposals for freelancers
Contrary to the rules, the majority of the contracting authorities did not allow an independent person to modify the proposed list of companies to be requested.
They justified this in particular by the lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies requested to submit the offer.
From some samples it emerged that freelancers had drawn up the applicant lists and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
In this way, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves from possible manipulation to the required extent.
Confidential treatment of bidders' lists
At a contracting authority, the lists of the companies to be requested were included in a data processing system that could be viewed by all the staff of that office.
In the event of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and, for example, allowed for collusion among those companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of candidates.
Nkú
Selection of candidates
When building a ring road, the bidders did not receive information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one case, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a procedure to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be demanded, the German regulations limit such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced stipulation of the largely unlimited number of bidders for non-public procedures can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the findings of the audit showed that some of these requirements were not sufficiently implemented and that the potential for tampering with an abusive restriction of the field of participants was not sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficits that have been identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the invitation to submit an offer, the bidding phase begins, in which the companies can draw up bids on the basis of the procurement documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their bids until the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities have to observe the national regulations, which aim to counteract the possibility of manipulation during the supply phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
The same or similar rules
The Procurement Documents on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their bids are, in principle, only to be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to carry out this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In the event of a lack of clarity on the tender documents or other questions relating to the tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers entrusted with the preparation of the tender documents are not allowed to provide information.
During the entire offer phase, it is necessary to prevent contact between the authorised freelancers and the applicants.
Freelancers must not be allowed to become a hub of the award procedure, through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Bids submitted by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have a technical encryption.
Diverging regulations
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies to print and send the Procurement Documents, whose employees must be required to keep the offers secret and to scrupulously fulfil the contractual obligations.
The offers received in Germany must be marked with an entry stamp and sent directly, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for the custody.
This employee must not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the bids received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority shall record the offer data, including the order numbers, as well as the creation and Receipt Details, in a protocol.
The safekeeping of offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Key test results
BRH
The tests for the tender phase focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building administration.
Dispatch of the Procurement Documents
The contracting authorities of the audited Building Authority sent the Procurement Documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send any tender documents.
Information to applicants
The approved building administration did not comply with the requirements for separating planning and awarding when naming the contact persons for questions and information.
Contrary to the specifications, in the performance descriptions, she did not specify employees from the contracting authority, but from the project management as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even included the names of freelancers who created the performance descriptions.
In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information when asking questions during the offer phase.
Labelling OF THE OFFERS
At the audited Building Administration, all the offers received were marked with an entry stamp and entry note.
However, in the case of some hands-free contracts, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the preconceptions on the prevention of corruption.
Keeping up the offers
After their identification, not all offers were immediately and immediately received by the custody officer, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office, to which each employee had access.
Another office had put up a letterbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers put in there remained overnight.
Since the slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate received offers.
Nkú
On the Czech side, no defects were found.
Summary findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and professionals involved in the procurement process will be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment will also be respected.
The regulations on the receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers seem suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up the offers
Opening up the offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made public.
From the opening date, bidders will be bound by their bids until the deadline set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal rules for opening up the offers.
However, the national rules on Corruption Prevention contain extensive provisions for the protection of offers and competition during this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure.
The multi-eyes principle, as well as the transparency and comprehensibility of the offer opening, are intended to prevent manipulation and changes in the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
The same or similar rules
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be appointed by the contracting authority.
The multi-eyes principle is designed to prevent individuals from manipulating the offers uncontrollably when opening the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can take part in the opening date.
Only offers submitted to the head of the negotiations at the opening of the first offer are allowed for the opening.
Late bids must not be taken into account in principle.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol, including the names of the bidders and the price of the offer.
The protocol is to be read out and signed by the head of the negotiations.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Diverging regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee conducts the opening of tenders.
Freelancers can also participate.
The Committee can also be charged with other phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary are opening up the offer.
The negotiator must be an employee of the bidding body.
The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in the building construction, also the Secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents, as well as in the awarding and execution of the contract.
In the minutes of the opening date, according to the German regulations, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or delayed offers - must be recorded in addition to the offer prices.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authorization of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that all open offers must be marked in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
The Czech regulations do not exist.
If only one bid is received in a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received, it must be opened and then evaluated.
Key test results
BRH
More-eyes principle
At the opening dates, the audited gassing units implemented the requirements for the multi-eyes principle.
They each carried out the opening dates with negotiators and writers who were not charged with any other gag treatment.
However, in the case of hands-free contracts with lower scope of services, there have been isolated cases in which freelancers have opened up offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling OF THE OFFERS
The contracting authorities examined during the cross-sectional examination marked the offers according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
Insufficient markings had been found in tests carried out by some recipients of the grant for a long time.
However, these gassing orders changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
Nkú
Offer deadline
When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the expiry of the offer period, but the contracting authority accepted the offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries to open up the offers are in agreement in significant parts, taking into account both the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency, which can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation when opening up the offers.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly limit the possibilities of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those charged with opening up the offers must not perform any other tasks related to the performance to be awarded.
The overall few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for opening up the offer.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
The examination and evaluation of the offers of the clients must examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
In doing so, he has to determine the offer for the award of the award, which is best suited to the requirements according to the specified award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU's requirements provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially viable and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that are legally convicted of bribery and fraud offences, for example, must in principle be excluded from participation in the award procedure.
The bids of the non-excluded bidders are to be examined mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly vulnerable phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can remain in competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the value result can be impermissible and thus the determination of the economically most advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore make special arrangements to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
The same or similar rules
In line with EU requirements, the offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the companies' aptitude certificates to be submitted, as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the assessment and their weighting, are laid down in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.
After checking the suitability of the bidder, the suitability criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The score has to be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined as to whether they are complete and whether, for example, they contain any anomalies that could indicate possible intentions of manipulation.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their bids, they must be informed immediately.
If the price of the offers appears to be inappropriately low, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions made during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Diverging regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly involved in the processing.
Only the contracting authority is allowed to carry out the review of the offers as well as the calculation of the offers.
It will only employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further testing and evaluation tasks is not regulated in more detail.
If freelancers are charged with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the Offers confidentially.
They are only allowed to make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
Procurement committees are to be set up in the Czech Republic to examine and evaluate bids.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If the documents or declarations required for submission of bids in Germany are only partially submitted, the contracting authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, can the offer be excluded from the rating.
In the Czech Republic, it is up to the contracting authority to decide whether it will give bidders the opportunity to complete the missing documents or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the uniform prices (prices for partial services) of the offers are to be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder is to be asked to clarify these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.
This is to prevent Bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their bid, which can lead to significant increases in the cost of construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices of partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
A surcharge may not be awarded in Germany for offers with inappropriately high or low prices.
If one or more bids fall short of the true price determination of the client or the bid totals of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their bids.
If they are not able to do so, the contracting authority can exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the economic assessment, if only offers with unjustifiable low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, for this reason, the contract cannot be refused for offers with prices considerably higher than the client's calculation.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its supervisory authority.
The latter has to decide which measures to take and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
For example, the competent authority at the top level must also agree on construction services of more than 50,000 euros if they are to be awarded on a hands-free basis, if a contract is not awarded on the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no regulations in the Czech Republic.

BRH
Suitability and Evaluation Criteria
The vast majority of the audited procurement procedures complied with the requirements listed.
For some of the companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required aptitude certificates being fully available.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken into account all the announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "price" criterion.
Selection of the persons involved and keeping the offers secret
Some contracting authorities used persons not authorised to do so when examining the offers.
For example, freelancers or employees working on the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that were only performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, freelancers charged with the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was often not clear whether the offers of freelancers were only accessible to those directly involved in the processing.
Review and calculation of the offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself, and without having reviewed their results.
In the event of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the audited documents, anomalies or missing price or product information were partly not or only insufficiently marked.
Performance audits
On a sample in a building Services Administration, the most favourable offers in three quarters of the audited procurement procedures deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs.
One in 20 procurement procedures has been overturned because of inappropriate offer prices.
Not all offers and information discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, there was a lack of further information, such as on the uniform prices of the most important positions.
Frequently, the deviations were only justified on a blanket basis, e.g. by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The Construction Services said it was difficult to detect and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of an invitation to tender by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimate of these services.
Detailed calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a briefing, the registry found no evidence of price dumping by the company that was then commissioned.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the commissioned company as a "low-cost company," which could not keep quality or deadlines.
In another tender, a construction agency awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
She did not cancel the tender, citing the non-factual reasoning that this company could conclude on an adequate calculation.
Suspicions of irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities in an audited Building Administration, both of which were reported to the specialist Inspectorate.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the remaining regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant objections.
Nkú
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects tested, including university construction, road construction and rail network expansion, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or were unable to prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
Standings
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the tenders.
In the case of a construction project to expand the rail network, the awarding authority only determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the predetermined criterion of "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the offered reduction was insufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third positions.
Documentation of the selection of offers
The registry did not document the criteria it had applied and the basis on which it had selected the successful bidder for three procurement procedures in the context of the Housing Promotion.
In the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 euros on the basis of telephone surveys on Prices and Terms of Delivery.
Tests of this selection were not possible, as the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The rules for the examination and evaluation of offers in both countries are in line with the requirements of the EU.
However, in the case of details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ from one another.
In Germany, the procedure is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the offered prices has to be checked.
In both countries, some of the audited procurement procedures have found that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of bids have not been documented, or have not been sufficiently documented.
Without comprehensibility and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favored.
A particularly serious shortcoming was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently looked through and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If contracting authorities have tasks done by third parties in the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased expenditure of control are necessary in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the appropriateness of prices, the services audited in Germany did not always make full use of the set of instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, there have been complaints, especially regarding the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the award procedure
After examination and evaluation of the bids, the award procedure will be concluded by awarding the award or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
The companies have the possibility to examine the intended Award in the case of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or in the case of other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
If a bidder makes a request for review within the information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review process.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the client to comply with public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
In order to do so, he must document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client is to place the order within the announced surcharge period,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound by their bids after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The underperforming bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and the reasons for not taking their bids into account.
Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. if the bid prices are excessive or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Diverging regulations
In the Czech Republic, there is a 10-day or 15-day obligation to provide information and to wait for an award, even in the case of construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide contracts.
In the case of the other procedures in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been granted.
In the Czech Republic, a tender procedure has to be cancelled if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been evaluated.
In Germany, the contract is to be awarded even in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key test results
BRH
In the case of the audited contracts, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the procurement procedures.
In some cases, companies have already received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may lead to the invalidity of the contract.
In individual cases, letters of order, following open procedures, also contain content that deviates from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the additional periods.
In the case of an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract to the second most advantageous offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the originally offered price after the expiry of the surcharge period.
Nkú
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content in the contract.
In the case of some contracts, such as road maintenance works, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after expiry of the legal deadline.
When awarding construction services for the renovation of former military sites, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award to all bidders after the legal deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements for the completion of the award procedure.
The legal protection of unsuccessful applicants or bidders will increase the tools for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech Public Procurement Law has also been extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing the order have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, the building authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting requirements
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the justifications of the individual decisions.
For EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistic.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption through the documentation of procurement procedures are implemented as a basic requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A meticulous and timely documentation only makes it possible to track the award decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for bidders in contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the obligation to explain award decisions in detail reduces the scope for manipulation.
The publication of a contract awarded in an EU-wide tender procedure has to be submitted by the respective contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, thus also implementing the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the relevant national ministries of the EU Commission.
On this basis, the European Commission draws up an annual EU statistics to provide an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech Public Procurement Law
The same or similar rules
Both countries have fully implemented the EU's documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Diverging regulations
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish awarded contracts is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide contracts, there is a publishing obligation only for limited tenders and for free-handed contracts with value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition process will receive information on the award of contracts.
Key test results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a tender procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements of contracts
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publicise the award of contracts.
Further procurement procedures lacked the evidence that the contracting authorities had made public the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistics that were seen contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a building administration did not publish this data due to a transmission error.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
So that the contract data of the procurement procedures completed up to that point were not published.
Nkú
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures for the construction of a major sporting event was seriously flawed, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the evaluation committees.
In addition, some protocols of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements of contracts
In the case of several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were only published belatedly or not at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are broadly in line in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, will be ensured in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The deficiencies in the documentation and in the notices that have been identified have in part significantly reduced the anti-rupture effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
Thissegmentisintentionallyleftblank
The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and Recommendations
The parallel tests of the ncú and the BRH have focused on two priorities, which are essential in the Czech Republic and in Germany for the award of construction services by public authorities: the application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law allow for cross-border competition to create a European single market.
Anti-corruption measures serve not only to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of trust in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of the public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these regulations, reveal similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
The EU's requirements for the award of construction services have been transposed into national law by both countries.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and in Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of construction services and the consideration of the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The building authorities of both countries have partially subjected these bids to extensive administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has also largely transferred the requirements for the construction services to be awarded across the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the courts of auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The Building Administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to remove the objections raised when implementing the EU requirements.
The tests in the Czech Republic have shown, above all, dangers that affect the profitability of the awards.
For example, incomplete performance descriptions required additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation, and cost assessments were usually insufficiently prepared, and excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the transport sector.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations have not had the aim of uncovering corruption cases,
It is also because the courts of auditors do not have the appropriate instruments to do so.
The courts of auditors can, however, examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
In the prevention of corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition and transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of the prevention of corruption, which the entire federal administration has to apply, apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations stipulate very precisely how the bids for preventing corruption should be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the BRH's view, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender in particular is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction works, while restrictions on competition increase the risk of manipulative intervention.
Risk analyses and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures, as well as various organisational measures, are also effective measures to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not see any fundamental need for changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules on preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the benchmarks.
The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the guidelines for preventing corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.
However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against illegal interference.
Nkú
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which public procurement is the most important element.
The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The ncú audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, as the contracting authorities have to justify the cost-effectiveness of the contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the type of evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The ncú and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU requirements in a fundamentally positive way.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for awarding construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal damage potential caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of auditors see the building authorities in their countries as being required to continue and, if necessary, to improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a favourable effect on offer prices, provided that this results in greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient contracting of public authorities.
In Germany, procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised Building Authorities, whereas in the Czech Republic, these tasks - with the exception of transport projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The courts of auditors of both countries have the intention to continue to develop the relevant findings and, if necessary, to bring them to the attention of the Parliament and the government of their country, even after the completion of their joint project.
Both courts of auditors also believe that the principles of public procurement law and its implementation, set out in this report, are of interest to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance for effectively countering corruption and ensuring the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
