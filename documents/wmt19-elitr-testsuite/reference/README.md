# ELITR Testsuite References

The texts were manually extracted from various SAO documents, Ondrej Bojar also
added the sample lease agreement extension: SMLprodl.

These are the original languages of each of the document:

BRH_2013    	en
KA_04_07    	cs
KA_04_23    	cs
KA_05_19    	cs
KA_05_34    	cs
KA_06_03    	en
KA_06_27    	en
KA_09_11_OCR	en
KA_13_04    	en
KA_15_33    	cs
SMLprodl    	cs

The other versions of each document are human translations from the original.

The corpus was created by semi-automatic cleanup, sentence alignment and
further cleanup to achieve up to a tri-parallel corpus, one sentence per line.

Due to occasional differences in sentence segmentation or even document content
across the translations, the documents occasionally contain lines without any
counterpart in the corresponding translations. These lines are indicated using
a special token ``THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank``. These are the number
of such lines per file:
