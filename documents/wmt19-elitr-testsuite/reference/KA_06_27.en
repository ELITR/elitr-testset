Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration was adopted in 1977 and emphasises that the supreme audit institutions (SAI) have powers to carry out audits of all public finances.
The Declaration requests that SAI shall be empowered to audit the collection of taxes as extensively as possible.
The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes one of the most significant parts of the public revenues.
The VI Congress EUROSAI held in Bonn in 2005 focused on an audit of public revenues by SAI.
One of the important steps on the way to optimise the audit activity of a SAI is to work out a special strategy for audit of public revenues.
This relates above all to taxes as the biggest source of public revenues that is also at a high risk of loss.
Since the economies of individual countries are more and more interconnected and interdependent SAI can be, in a certain manner, unable to perform audit activities without cooperation with SAI of other countries.
As an example we can mention the audit of internationally organised fraud that causes significant revenue losses in many countries.
In fighting against such crime, the cooperation between authorities is a necessity.
SAI that carry out audits in this area need to be willing to work closely together.
The idea to carry out an audit on value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) and the VIES system came up at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was performed in cooperation between the Czech Supreme Audit Office and the German Supreme Audit Institution, Bundesrechnungshof.
During following detailed preparations, both SAI had to familiarise with the law environment and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Based on an information analysis, we had made the selection of audit topics that we put on the audit programme.
Achieving efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of VAT is a long-term problem and individual countries (the EC Member States especially) are looking for an answer on how to improve the system, how to simplify VAT collection and make it more transparent.
We are convinced that the results of our audit may help not only to improve tax administrators´ work, but also serve as a basis for improving an international information exchange system.
Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Audit number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject of audit:
(CZ) Administration of value added tax following accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(D) Review of the administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004
Objective of audit:
(CZ) The objective of the audit in the Czech Republic was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating value added tax following integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter “EC”), connected with free movement of goods and services, and to review the use of the VIES, particularly monitoring the exercise of the right to exempt intraCommunity deliveries from value added tax.
(D) The objective of the audit was to review the system of intraCommunity VAT control with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the above mentioned regulations.
As a result of this, weaknesses should be reported and recommendations be developed to address the problems stated.
Value Added Tax Information Exchange System The audits were performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic (hereinafter the “SAO”) and by the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter “BRH”) in mutual cooperation on the basis of an agreement concluded between the two audit institutions on June 8, 2006.
The cooperation primarily concerned the review of selected commercial transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter “CR”) and from the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter “Germany”), use of information obtained via international cooperation between tax administrations and comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was processed in the sense of European Directive No. 31 for implementing the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audits
Based on an agreement between the two SAI the parallel audit on the administration of VAT in the CR and Germany was carried out.
Besides the main point – exchange of information based on the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 – the audit covered other topics as for instance the registration of taxpayers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements that are closely linked with it.
Additionally, the legal situation in terms of international bus transportation of passengers and the comparison of certain statistical data were part of the audit.
By comparing the systems of administration of VAT in the two countries differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT.
Whereas entrepreneurs in Germany are registered regardless of the volume of their turnover, in the CR the prime criterion (except others) for registration is exceeding of the turnover limit set down in the law on VAT.
In the CR, taxpayers are assigned one tax identification number only, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.
For VAT registration purposes in Germany taxpayers are assigned a tax number that serves only for business transactions within the German territory.
If German taxpayers intend to do intra-Community transactions, they have to apply for assignment of a special identification number, so-called VAT ID.
Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC (see 4.1).
2) International bus transportation of passengers.
In the CR, the international bus transportation of passengers is exempt from VAT with the right for VAT deduction.
In Germany, the part of transportation that takes place in the German territory is subject to VAT.
At EC level, efforts should be undertaken to harmonise the situation, in the sense of article 393 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC, on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).
3) VAT returns.
While in the CR taxpayers submit VAT returns only for particular taxable periods (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of a calendar year, they have to submit an annual VAT return.
In contrast to Czech taxpayers, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns electronically.
Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the CR would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Recapitulative statements.
Whereas taxpayers in the CR submit recapitulative statements to tax offices, in Germany taxpayers submit recapitulative statements to the CLO.
Therefore, tax offices in the CR have the data contained in recapitulative statements available immediately after their submission.
German tax offices have information from recapitulative statements available only after their processing at the CLO.
Combating VAT fraud requires updated information about intra-Community transactions as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of recapitulative statements would shorten the time lag between the date of the transaction and the update of VIES data.
Consequently, this would allow timely review of the taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4).
For this purpose all Member States of the EC would have to introduce the same deadline for submission of recapitulative statement.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
On receiving a request for information, the Czech CLO observes compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not follow up elapsed time.
As a result of this the German tax administration dealt with a significantly lower percentage of received requests within the set deadline.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended to the German CLO to introduce a steady reminding exercise (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of both Member States is developing its own risk management system (hereinafter “RMS”), that has its strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of cooperation, the two SAI reviewed selected cases of intra-Community transactions processed by tax entities in the CR and Germany.
Thirty-one cases of business transactions were reviewed jointly using the legal provisions of the CLO, where there were doubts about their realization, their proper treatment or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The SAI found that:
In some cases, tax offices made use of the information obtained via international exchange and have reassessed taxpayer’s VAT liability.
In those cases, taxpayers either unlawfully applied the right for exemption of supplies from VAT, or did not declare acquisition of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, tax offices could not make use of the information obtained, because the information was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of differing legal provisions in both Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to reply to a request for information.
Some cases were detected, where taxpayers wrongly declared business transactions in their recapitulative statements.
As a result of this, data in VIES were erroneous and therefore the tax administrators had to review those cases (see 6).
Audit procedure
Audit procedure in the CR
The audit was performed in the period from June 2006 to March 2007 by the Division II – Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, North-Western Bohemia, Southern Bohemia Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter the “MoF”) and 10 tax offices – the tax office in Humpolec, the tax office in Jihlava, the tax office in Kadaň, the tax office in Liberec, the tax office in Nymburk, the tax office in Otrokovice, the tax office for Prague 1, the tax office for Prague 4, the tax office in Sokolov and the tax office in Třinec.
The SAO Collegium approved the conclusions of this audit on April 23, 2007.
Audit procedure in Germany
The audit was performed in the period from July 2006 to February 2007 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the audit programme for 2006 and therefore announced to the Federal MoF in 2006.
After a test phase the audit started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later selected by the SAO, the BRH notified a number of federal states of the audit mission.
Besides interviews at the Federal MoF and the CLO the audit was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files of the following tax offices were included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, München II, IV und München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord und Hamburg für Großunternehmen, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I und Zschopau.
Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim und Verden.
The audit findings were reported to the MoF in May 2007.
Cooperation of the two audit institutions
As part of preparing parallel audits, several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions were held in the period prior to their commencement.
Participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of the tax administrations, legislation on VAT and the VAT administration system in the two countries.
The subject matter of the testing phase was agreed at the meeting that was held in May 2006.
The results of the testing phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, also a timetable was agreed for further procedure, and the following subjects for parallel audits were selected:
1. Registration of VAT payers.
2.
International passenger bus transportation – legislation in the CR and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the processing of requests for information and furthermore how the tax offices reviewed selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, and in the spontaneous information supplied between the CR and Germany.
4. VAT returns.
5.
Recapitulative statements.
6.
Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and the Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
At a meeting of the SAO and the BRH, held in December 2006, the two parties became acquainted with the audit procedure in the CR and Germany and discussed results achieved in the parallel audits.
A report on the results of the parallel audits of the administration of VAT between the CR and Germany was elaborated at the working meeting in July 2007.
4. Administration of value added tax in the CR and Germany
Registrace plátců k DPH
A) Taxpayers with their offi cial seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR
Pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees (hereinafter “Act No. 337/1992 Coll.”) the term tax entity refers to a taxpayer, a taxable person and the legal successor of a natural or legal person that is a tax entity definedby law. 
As of December 31, 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the CR.
The number of tax entities registered for VAT has increased to 457,590 by 1 December 2005.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, whose turnover in the most recent 12 preceding consecutive calendar months exceeded the sum of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) becomes a taxpayer on the 1st day of the third month following after the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (§ 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”).
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not permit registering a person obliged to pay tax retroactively in cases taxpayers exceed the legal term to submit the application for registration.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who performs taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to tax deduction, is obliged to register for VAT even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), provided that he fulfils any of other conditions stated in the Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who does not fulfil any of the conditions stated by the law, may apply for registration for VAT voluntarily.
When the application for registration is submitted to the competent local tax administrator the registration procedure pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll. starts.
A voluntary VAT payer shall also state, in the application for registration for VAT, the date as of which he requests registration as a VAT payer.
The tax administrator shall verify the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all its annexes.
If he is in doubt as to the stated data, he shall request the tax entity to explain, supplement or document the data.
When the tax administrator has verified that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, he shall issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the tax entity is registered and that it has been allocated a tax identification number (hereinafter the “ID”).
In the certificate the tax administrator shall state the date when the registration for VAT became effective and the periodicity of the tax period for VAT.
The taxable period is one calendar quarter unless the taxpayer’s turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).
If the taxpayer’s turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the taxable period is one calendar month.
A taxpayer, whose turnover for the previous calendar year attained an amount of CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150), is entitled to choose a calendar month as the tax period and shall notify the tax administrator of this change.
The assignment of an ID in the certificate of registration is always constitutive in character.
The tax entity is obliged to state it in all communications (including payments) with the tax administrator, and in those cases stipulated by a special law (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll., in drawing up tax documents).
The ID contains the code “CZ” and a basic part, consisting of a general identifier.
For natural persons, the general identifier is the birth certificate number or some other general identifier if so stipulated by a special law, and for a legal person, the general identifier is the business identification number (provisions of § 33 (12) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).
If the tax entity has not fulfilled its obligation in spite of being requested to do so by the tax administrator, the competent local tax administrator shall register it at his own initiative.
The registration proceeding results in the issuing a Certificate of Registration ex officio, which shall be delivered to the tax entity.
In the CR, a tax entity that has acquired authorisation for a business activity is assigned an ID at the moment of his first registration for any kind of tax.
The tax entity also uses the same ID when he is registered as a VAT payer.
According to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which came into effect on January 1, 2005, in case of failure to comply with the registration obligation for VAT, the tax administrator may require that the taxable person has to pay up to 10% of the total revenues or income for taxable transactions that this person performed illegally without tax, for the period from the date on which he should have been registered as a taxpayer by law to the date on which he became a taxpayer on the basis of a decision by the tax administrator (provision of § 98 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
Payment of this stipulated amount is considered to constitute payment of tax of § 98 (3) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.
When the conditions laid down by law are met, the registration of a VAT payer may be cancelled for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of the registration at the taxpayer’s request, i.e. primarily for reasons of the level of turnover, which does not attain the registration limit (§ 106 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
Taxpayers may request cancellation of registration not earlier than 1 year after the date of legal force mentioned in the certificate of registration.
2) Cancellation of registration “ex officio” (§ 106 (7) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), “if: a) the taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) the taxpayer failed to fulfill his obligations pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxes”.
B) Taxpayers without an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR A person registered for taxes in another Member State, who does not have an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, or a foreign person obliged to pay tax, who performs a transaction which takes place in this country and who is a person obliged to report and pay taxes on such supply pursuant to § 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (i.e. an “non-resident taxpayer”) becomes a taxpayer on the date of performing this transaction.
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration with the tax office for Prague 1 at the latest on the date of performance of the supply.
In the application for registration, he is obliged to report all VAT IDs that he was assigned to in other Member States or in a third country.
If a “non-resident” taxpayer submits an application for registration later than on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR, the tax office for Prague 1 shall register him retroactively as, pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax entity became a VAT payer on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR.
In cases of retroactive registration, the tax office for Prague 1 shall request from tax entities a document that the supply was performed (invoices or explanatory letters).
If a “non-resident” tax entity requests registration in the CR, prior to performance of the first taxable transaction the tax office for Prague 1 shall request submission of agreements that the performance of the transaction will occur.
As of December 31, 2004, a total of 473 “non-resident” taxpayers were registered at the tax office for Prague 1, of which 124 were taxpayers from Germany; as of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 “non-resident” taxpayers were registered, of which 233 were taxpayers from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., tax administrators shall be authorised to cancel the registration of an “non-resident” taxpayer as of January 31 of the following calendar year if this taxpayer does not incur any obligation to report and pay tax.
The SAO found that, if a “non-resident” taxpayer submitted a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal requirements of the date for submitting a tax return, the tax office often has not yet received it by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, decisive for the possibility of cancelling registration, are known by the tax office later than 31 January, it is not possible to cancel the registration for VAT for the “non-resident” taxpayer in the CR in the given calendar year.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
Due to the legal provisions in the German fiscal code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter “AO”) anybody who performs a business is obliged to inform the municipality and/or the tax office in charge.
The deadline for submitting the information is one month after the start of the business.
The municipality conveys the information to the tax authorities.
If the tax authority finds out a going but unregistered business the competent tax office is able to register the taxpayer ex officio – even retroactively.
Taxpayers in Germany, both being resident or non-resident, are legally obliged to register for VAT whenever they fulfil the criteria set forth in § 2 of the German VAT law (hereinafter “UStG).
This does not depend on the volume of turnover produced.
A voluntary registration does not exist in Germany.
For entrepreneurs who are resident abroad special tax offices exist.
For instance for those who have their seat in the CR the tax office Chemnitz-Süd is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004 a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered by the tax office Chemnitz-Süd; as of 1 March 2006 a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.
The BRH found that those special tax offices frequently denied the registration of so called quasi-dependent freelancers with a residence in the new eastern Member States of the EC.
Since after joining the EC the labour permits for employees of the ten new European Member States are limited, those freelancers tried to avoid these limits by starting a business.
These businesses do not fulfil the criteria for entrepreneurs as set in § 2 UStG because they are usually dependent on a sole employer who determines their labour time and the way of doing their labour.
In order to get registered the entrepreneur has to complete a questionnaire of the competent tax office, in which he has to give information about the company and the activities performed.
The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding for all tax offices in Germany.
It is processed either in special units of the tax office or in the general units that are responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.
With the help of this form a risk assessment of the individual taxpayer is carried out before the tax office issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows specific rules:
First three figures provide the information which tax office is in charge of, the subsequent three (or four) give information about which department in the tax office is responsible, the next five (or four) are for classifying taxpayers whereas the last one is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to receive tax-exempt intraCommunity supplies.
A VAT ID is granted by the CLO upon application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a VAT number.
The VAT ID will be assigned automatically by the CLO when taxpayers declare intra-Community deliveries in their VAT returns.
The structure of the VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a string of nine numbers.
An entrepreneur can be deregistered: 1. On application (for instance when he gave up his business) after all the administrative work is done (assessments for all business years) and 2. in case the tax administration realises that he no longer carries out a business.
Usually the validity of the VAT ID is aligned with the validity of the VAT number.
The tax offices have to inform the CLO about the cancellation of the VAT number so that the CLO can end the validity of the VAT ID in those cases.
According to German VAT law (§ 19 (1) UStG) resident taxpayers are not obliged to pay VAT in case 1. the turnover plus respective VAT of the previous calendar year did not exceed the amount of EUR 17,500 and 2. is not likely to exceed the amount of EUR 50,000 in the following year.
The so-called „Kleinunternehmer“ (small entrepreneurs) are not allowed to invoice other entrepreneurs for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Though they are not obliged to pay VAT small entrepreneurs have to be registered by the tax office and have to submit an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He is then allowed to invoice VAT and to deduct input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The precondition for this is that they are involved in tax exempt transactions only and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur so that he does not need to register for VAT.
The invoices have to mention that fiscal representation is applied.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered independent of their turnover volume, in the CR, the first criteria (besides other) for registration is the excess of the limit set forth in the VAT law.
If a tax entity does not exceed the set limit, it has an option to ask for voluntary registration.
The registration process is standardised in Germany but differences may occur because of varying organisational patterns in the federal states.
In the CR, a taxpayer is assigned a tax identification number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In case taxpayers register for VAT, they use the same ID also in intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, a taxpayer registering for VAT is assigned a tax number serving only for transactions within the territory of Germany.
If the German taxpayer intends to do intra-Community transactions, he has to ask for assignment of a special identification number, a so-called VAT ID.
Both the SAO and the BRH found the German two-stage system of registration could cause a lot of misunderstandings in other Member States such as the CR that allocates one single identification number for both national VAT registration and registration for intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-stage system permits the retroactive (national) registration in cases where taxpayers refuse to inform the municipality or the competent tax office about his business.
This retroactive registration ensures the proper VAT assessment of previous assessment periods, especially an exact estimation of a VAT liability.
Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC.
German Parliament recently decided to establish a tax identification number (hereinafter TIN).
The Federal Finance Office will allocate the TIN after the birth of a natural person.
This TIN will be valid for the whole life of a natural person resident in Germany.
If a natural person starts a business the competent tax office will apply for an economic TIN that will be used as a VAT ID.
So in future there should be no time lag between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID.
The work to implement an IT medium to administrate the TINs has not been finished until now.
International passenger bus transportation
Legislation in the CR
Pursuant to the provisions of § 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the transportation of passengers between the individual Member States and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT in the CR, with the right for tax deduction, as from May 1, 2004.
This transportation is exempt from VAT even if performed by entrepreneurs who are registered for taxes in other Member States or a foreign person obliged to pay tax.
In this respect, return transport is considered to be a separate transport.
If “non-resident” tax entities do not perform any other economic activity in the CR except for international passenger bus transport, they are not obliged to register in the CR as VAT payers.
International passenger transport was exempted from VAT in the CR on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR, Annex No. V, Chap. 5 (1) (b), where it is stated that:
“For the purposes of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may maintain an exemption from value added tax on international transport of passengers, referred to in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, until the condition set out in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or for as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the present Member States, whichever is the earlier.”
Legislation in Germany
According to Article 46 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 as implemented into § 3b (1) UStG the place of the supply of transport of passengers is the place where the route takes place.
So the German taxation does not make a distinction between a national and an international cross-border transport of passengers.
Only the part of the transport occurring on German territory, is a taxable supply of transport in Germany.
Also the German taxation does not distinguish between resident and non-resident taxpayers.
If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through Germany the part of the route in Germany is also considered as a taxable supply of transport.
The non-resident taxpayer has to announce his intention to supply the transport of passengers to the tax office in charge before he accomplishes his services in Germany.
The tax office registers the non-resident taxpayer for taxation (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is named in the taxpayer’s announcement.
The taxpayer has to declare his taxable supplies of transport in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, the tax office Chemnitz-Süd registered 741 Czech taxpayers whose business was the transport of passengers.
If the transport of passengers is supplied to a resident taxable person for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay VAT to the tax office by himself.
Instead of him the resident acquirer of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer; this process is known as reverse charge and consistent with Article 196 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
Apart from the announcement of a non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return the German tax administration has several means to assess the accurate declaration of taxable supplies of transport of passengers:
Mobile control groups of the customs authority audit the certificates of foreign-licensed busses that are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each audit the mobile control groups send an inspection note to the tax office in charge.
If the bus driver lacks a valid certificate the mobile control group is authorised to demand the VAT from the bus driver before he continues the transport.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct this paid VAT from the tax calculated in his VAT return.
If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return it can announce an audit that has to take place in the tax office or it can use the means of administrative cooperation that are named in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if the non-resident taxpayer declines the payment of the lawfully stated VAT, the tax office can ask for the administrative cooperation of Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
To review a non-resident taxpayer’s VAT return or the fulfilment of his obligations, the BRH considered all these means of administrative cooperation as too labour-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT that have to be paid for taxable supplies of transport of passengers.
Especially an audit of a non-resident taxpayer’s accounting leads to disproportional costs for both taxpayers and tax administration.
The latter has to audit the foreign accounting that does not only mean to understand the foreign language but to also know the foreign accounting standards.
So this audit is likely to take more time than an audit of a resident taxpayer, yet the audit is restricted to those passenger transports, that take place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer has not only to accept the audit rights of his national tax administration but also audits of other Member States wherever he transports passengers.
Moreover, for each Member State in that only one supply of transport of passengers takes place, taxpayers have to fulfil any duties of taxation in all of these Member States, respectively in all different languages and using all tax forms of these EC Member States.
So the actual taxation of crossborder transport of passengers causes unreasonable bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in both countries is different.
In the CR, the transport of passengers between the individual Member States of the EC and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT with the right for tax deduction, on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR.
In Germany, the part of the transport, that takes place within the German territory, is a taxable transaction.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such transport for the first time, he is obliged to announce it to a competent tax office in advance.
The tax office registers taxpayers and taxpayers have to declare the taxable portion of transport in a tax return in Germany.
Applying the law in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three of four Czech taxpayers registered in the tax office Chemnitz-Süd do their business in the transport of passengers.
Compared to the efforts required tax revenue is rather low.
The Member States – that levy VAT in accordance to Article 46 of the Council directive 2006/112/EC of November 28th, 2006, on the common system of VAT – are burdened with time-consuming duties without a financially sensible goal.
To avoid the disproportional costs to assess the VAT, the supplies of cross-border transport of passengers should be taxed in one Member State only.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the supplier is resident.
Such taxation would require a modification of the Council directive 2006/112/EC.
VAT returns
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in the CR
A taxpayer is obliged to submit a VAT return on a form prescribed by the MoF within 25 days after the end of the taxable period, even if he has not incurred a tax liability, unless the law stipulates otherwise.
The actual tax liability falls due within the deadline for submitting the VAT return, with the exception of tax assessed in connection with import of goods pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., where the due date for the taxes is stipulated by the customs regulations.
If a returnable overpayment occurs as a consequence of excessive deduction, it is returned to the taxpayer without request within 30 days after assessing the excessive deduction.
The deadline is not applied in cases, where the tax administrator commences tax proceedings concerning taxpayer’s tax liability.
In accordance with § 73 (11) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct input tax may be exercised in a regular VAT return at the latest for the last taxable period of the calendar year in which the right to tax deduction could be exercised.
After expiry of this deadline, the right to deduct input tax may further be exercised within 3 years after the end of the tax period in which the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.
However, this is possible only through submission of an additional VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from January 1, 2005, permits submission of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.
A taxpayer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, b) he performs corrections in which the last known tax liability does not change, but only information formerly stated by the tax entity is changed, c) he corrects the rate and amount of taxes pursuant to § 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A taxpayer may submit an additional VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces his tax liability.
The taxpayer is obliged to submit the additional VAT return by the end of the following month after determination of these facts.
A VAT return may be submitted in electronic form either via the Internet or on a technical data carrier.
Submission by Internet may be performed as a submission with a data report attached with a certified electronic signature or as a submission without attaching a data report with a certified electronic signature.
If a data report is not attached with a certified electronic signature, it must also be submitted in written form, i.e. delivery of the computer file to the tax administrator (e-form).
The VAT return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.
Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of primary automated controls as part of the ATIS system.
The value of goods supplied to other EC Member States for entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared to the data given in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.
The value of goods acquired from other Member States from entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared with the values obtained via the VIES system from recapitulative statements of taxpayers from other Member States of the EC.
Under the ATIS system, a test of the trustworthiness of VAT returns takes place at the tax office.
This test occurs automatically as the VAT return cannot be assessed without performance of the test.
The test of the trustworthiness includes a calculation of the trustworthiness criteria and an evaluation of the risky types of VAT returns.
Pursuant to the Provisions of § 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll., the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who does not meet his obligations of a non-monetary nature following from this or a special tax law or imposed in a decision pursuant to this law.
Automated tax information system, which the tax office uses for technical support for administration of taxes.
The SAO found that the tax offices mostly did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers for failure to submit a VAT return.
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany we differentiate between preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT returns and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns nevertheless have to submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT have to submit an annual VAT return.
Taxpayers generally have to submit quarterly VAT returns by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability exceeded EUR 6,136 in the previous calendar year or in case of a newly established business the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT returns by the 10th day following the respective month.
The taxpayer may also choose to submit monthly VAT returns if there was a refund in the preceding year, which exceeded EUR 6,136 (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
VAT returns need not be submitted if the annual VAT did not exceed EUR 512.
The corresponding VAT liability has to be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT arose.
A refund may lead to a more detailed investigation by the tax authorities.
Deadlines (by law) for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of excessive VAT do not exist.
To achieve the refund in time, it is possible to offer a security for the repayable amount.
It is a basic principle to process VAT returns and refunds promptly.
Under German VAT law this time limit may be extended (§ 18 (6) UStG).
Such extension has to be applied for separately.
Taxpayers may submit VAT returns and pay the corresponding VAT liabilities one month later, provided that in case of monthly returns a special advance payment is made.
This payment is balanced against the December VAT liability.
Whenever a mistake is detected a corrected VAT return has to be submitted by the entrepreneur.
An “additional” VAT return does not exist.
Once the annual VAT return which has to be submitted until 31 May of the following calendar year is filed with the tax office the entrepreneur cannot correct a wrong preliminary VAT return but his wrong annual VAT return.
A correction of this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer is possible during the following four years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was submitted.
As a rule, after these four years an annual VAT return may be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or tax evasion.
Taxpayers are obliged to submit the preliminary VAT returns electronically.
The tax offices to avoid undue hardships can apply exceptions to this rule.
Submission of the annual VAT return is possible on paper or via Internet with or without certification.
If done without certification taxpayers have to submit the return once more on paper with their personal signature.
In cases of non-submission of VAT returns the tax administration is authorised to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer’s turnover.
In cases of delayed submission an additional penalty charge can be levied on the taxpayer (the maximum is 10 % of the tax to be paid or EUR 25,000).
During a previous audit the BRH found that the tax offices frequently do not impose this default fine.
In the other cases the tax offices imposed the penalty the amount was assessed inconsistently and highhandedly.
So the default fine misses its goal to shorten the average delay particularly in the submission of the annual VAT return.
The tax return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.
Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions have to be declared in a separate line of the VAT return.
VAT returns that are submitted on paper have to be recorded either via scanner or by special staff.
The data of electronically submitted VAT returns are available to the tax administrator immediately.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data are logged in the system the risk management is applied to it and all cases meeting certain criteria are selected.
Those VAT returns chosen have to be checked by the tax administrator based on the inspection note produced by the system (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration has to estimate roughly the VAT the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as exact as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CR, taxpayers submit VAT returns until 25 days after the end of a taxable period.
Depending on taxpayer’s turnover, taxable period is either the calendar quarter orcalendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers submit preliminary VAT returns, depending on their tax liability in the previous year either until 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
By 31 May of the following year, taxpayers are obliged to submit an annual VAT return.
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some pros and cons:
+ after the expiration of the calendar year taxpayers are able to correct the errors in the monthly preliminary VAT returns by submission of one single VAT return;
– if taxpayers correct their statements concerning intraCommunity transactions the correction cannot be related to a reporting period of the recapitulative statement;
– the federal states compare the data of VIES about intraCommunity acquisitions of German taxpayers not until the annual VAT returns are usually processed.
In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3) German entrepreneurs are obliged to submit an annual VAT return independently from the amount of their turnover.
This duty enables the German tax authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.
Furthermore the tax office in charge is able to compare the annual VAT return with those for direct taxes and with the year-end accounts.
In the CR, tax administrators are able to determine the volume of taxpayer’s turnover only from submitted income tax return.
In contrast to the CR, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns electronically.
Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns in the CR electronically would increase the efficiency of Czech tax administration.
Recapitulative statements
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR
Pursuant to the provisions of § 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., recapitulative statements (hereinafter “RS”) are submitted by a taxpayer who supplied goods to another Member State to a person registered for taxes in the other Member State.
Information on the value of goods supplied is always stated in the RS in Czech currency and is classified according to individual tax entities with specification of their VAT IDs, under which they are registered in their country.
Data on services are not provided in the RS.
Taxpayers submit an RS for monthly and quarterly taxable periods for each calendar quarter to the 25th day after its termination to the competent local tax office.
Erroneous data are corrected in the corrected RS within 15 days after identifying the errors.
Erroneous data stated in the RS are always replaced by the data stated in the corrected RS.
Similar to tax returns, taxpayers may also submit RS in electronic form.
If a taxpayer does not submit a RS or corrected RS and was obliged to do so pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator shall invite him to submit them and shall simultaneously advise him about the consequences of not submitting the RS or corrected RS, i.e. that in case of a failure to comply with obligations of a non-monetary nature, the tax administrator is authorised to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) pursuant to § 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.
The SAO found that the tax offices frequently did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers failing to comply with their legal obligations.
Particularly in relation to submitting RS, tax entities are not adequately motivated to comply with their obligations as a failure to submit RS does not affect their VAT liability.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is obliged to verify data in the RS or corrected RS, to eliminate any lack of clarity and use the data for determining tax liability.
Where the data in the RS and the data in the relevant VAT returns (taxpayers with monthly taxable period) or relevant VAT return (taxpayers with quarterly taxable period) do not correspond, the tax administrator should verify the accuracy of tax liability stated in the VAT return.
The tax entity eliminates erroneous information in the RS through submission of a corrected RS at its own initiative or it may be invited to do so.
The tax administrator shall correct data on supply of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
– if taxpayers can not justify the data stated in the RS (or corrected RS) and therefore correct them by submission of a corrected RS,
– the tax administrator demonstrated that the data stated by taxpayers in the RS or corrected RS are not accurate.
Corrections entered by the tax administrator without the submission of a corrected RS by these taxpayers shall not replace a submission by the tax entity, but only adjust the data in the VIES database so that it is up to date, complete and precise.
Data from the RS are sent to the relevant Member States.
Solely the national financial administrative authority, designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may send and receive this data. This is the CLO (in CR this function is fulfilled by the MoF, International Cooperation in VAT Administration Department (CLO)).
O_MCTL is an automatic report that the CLO obtains from other Member States.
It contains all the erroneous VAT IDs entered in the sent RS lines.
If the erroneous VAT ID is used on some of the transferred common lines of the RS or corrected RS, an entry is made in the table of the erroneous VAT IDs.
The table contains a “Notification of doubts on VAT ID”.
The tax administrator verifies the data and records the result of verification in the system.
Concerning acquisition of goods from another Member State, taxpayers are obliged to declare VAT and state the acquisition value in separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of discrepancies in the value of the acquired goods declared by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns and the value of the supplied goods as entered by taxpayers from another Member State in their RS, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for review.
The tax administrators are obliged to investigate discrepancies.
Three situations can occur:
a) The value declared by a Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is lower than the value of the supply declared by taxpayers from the EC.
In this case, the tax administrator verifies the accuracy of the data.
b) The amount of the difference equals 0.
This situation can occur either through a change in data in the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his RS) or through a change in data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity submits an additional VAT return by itself in the meantime).
In this case, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he nonetheless verifies the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.
c) The value of goods acquired from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer entered in the relevant lines of the VAT return, is higher than the value of the supplied goods declared by EC taxpayers.
Here again, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he verifies the accuracy of the data.
After the verifying the difference and clarifying the underlying reasons the tax administrator enters the results of the verification into ATIS.
The results of verification are transferred to the CLO.
The number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for review for the individual quarters of 2005 is illustrated in graph No. 1 (Note: source: MoF).
Graph No. 1 above documents that the number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for the individual quarters of 2005 decreased.
There was a substantial decrease in the number of the 4th quarter of 2005, because the CLO increased the minimal financial limit, i.a., with respect to the possibility of sending a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Discrepancies between data in the VAT returns and data from the EC need not always to be caused by an error on the part of the domestic taxpayer.
It may also be attributable to an error on the part of the EC taxpayer or an error that occurred because some types of supplies may be entered in the RS differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values of reported transactions revealed at the audited tax offices are given in Table No. 1.
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions are required to file quarterly RS in that the intra-Community deliveries per recipient are listed (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The RS must be filed until the 10th day of the month following the respective calendar quarter.
If extension is granted for the preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to the RS.
The RS needs to be delivered to the CLO.
Starting from 1 January 2007 they have to be delivered electronically.
The competent tax offices may grant exceptions to certain taxpayers to avoid undue hardships.
In cases where taxpayers realise that the RS was wrong they are obliged to submit a corrected statement within one month.
If taxpayers failed to submit an RS the CLO will initiate a procedure to ensure submission of the statement.
This procedure includes: – first reminder – second reminder linked with the threat of a fine and – imposing the fine.
Although the German Fiscal Code permits imposing a fine up to EUR 25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps in the amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.
Besides this, § 26a (1) Nr. 5 UStG stipulates that taxpayers act illegally if they intentionally or carelessly do not issue a RS properly, state it incompletely or not in time or if they do not amend a RS at all or not in time.
This offence can be sanctioned by a fine up to EUR 5,000.
Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office because processing of RS is an exclusive task of the CLO.
RS data are stored in the system of the CLO only.
So the figures of the RS are visible to the tax office only after their processing at the CLO.
The deadlines for processing RS are set forth in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Data of the RS have to be stored within three months after the respective calendar quarter.
In case of erroneous VAT IDs in the RS of German taxpayers the CLO gets an O_MCTL from the other Member State.
The CLO contacts the entrepreneur and asks for the accurate data.
If the CLO does not succeed in getting the correct information the case is handed over to the competent tax offices.
It is now their turn to ask for the correct data.
The BRH found out that most of the entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID on request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, the threat and the assessment of three additional fines take too much time in cases where a taxpayer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
Those cases that were finally reported to the competent tax offices, were usually completed within one or two months.
The tax office refused the tax exemption of the declared intra-Community supplies in 73 % of these cases.
If taxpayers submitted the right VAT ID the tax office asked them to submit a corrected RS to the CLO, because the tax offices are not able to correct the VIES data by themselves.
The BRH found that neither the tax offices nor the CLO monitored the submission of the corrected RS. So often taxpayers did not comply with the request.
Due to the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data a comparison of the data on supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the RS does not take place before submitting those data to the CLO of the other Member States.
This check is possible only for the tax offices and is usually made when preparing a VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States are processed in the CLO.
Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and submitted to the respective Member States.
The data are used for purposes of acquisition control in the tax offices.
As soon as they are in the system the CLO checks them against the data of previous calendar quarters.
In cases that comply with certain criteria (see 5.2) control information is created and sent to the competent tax offices.
This is done permanently whereas a compilation of the acquisition data for all taxpayers is created later and submitted to the tax offices.
The RMS installed for the assessment procedure then checks those data against the data of intraCommunity acquisitions.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs, who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CR, taxpayers that delivered intra-Community supplies to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, submit a RS within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to a competent local tax office.
Tax offices process RS and transmit the data to the CLO.
Values of intra-Community supplies, stated by taxpayers in the RS, are compared by the tax offices with the values of intraCommunity supplies, stated by the same taxpayers in VAT returns.
Results of the comparison are used as part of assessment proceedings.
In Germany, taxpayers that performed intra-Community supplies are obliged to submit quarterly RS within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Taxpayers submit the RS to the CLO, as from 1 January 2007 electronically.
For tax offices, the data from RS are at disposal only after their processing at the CLO.
Taxpayers both from the CR and Germany declare in RS only supplies of goods.
Rendering of services is not stated in RS.In contrast to the Czech tax offices the German tax offices are not able to correct wrong lines in a submitted RS by themselves.
Owing to this limited access to the German VIES data wrong VAT IDs were not corrected even if taxpayers communicated the right VAT ID to the tax office.
The German tax administration does not compare the data of intra-Community supplies that are declared in a German taxpayer’s VAT return with his RS.
Differences between the data of these two returns are usually not detected before the German CLO submits the VIES data to other Member States.
Considering these findings of the BRH it is obvious that a comparison would increase the reliability of the submitted VIES data.
Data on supply of goods for the Czech taxpayers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the CR with data on acquisition of goods as stated in the Czech taxpayers´ VAT returns.
Comparison is made by CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most important deviations are transmitted to the tax offices for review.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German one does not generally check the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general verification is carried out only for taxpayers, which are not fully entitled to deduct input VAT.
Furthermore, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxpayers only if the RMS produces an inspection note or if taxpayers are selected for an audit at any rate.
This process disburdens the tax offices to clarify the reasons of any difference.
On the other hand the disclosure of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
Combating carousel fraud requires continually updated information about intra-Community acquisitions.
The current system of RS, especially VIES, provides the tax authorities with information which may even be six months old.
This time lag could be shortened by up to four months if taxpayers had to submit a monthly RS.
The monthly submission would not be a considerable increase in bureaucratic costs because most of the taxpayers in CR and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns anyway – and the RS do not require any further information than the VAT return.
To avoid any bureaucratic costs the submission of the RS could be connected with the submission of VAT returns.
However, an obligation to submit monthly RS would cause more temporary mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community supplies and intra-Community acquisitions and it would increase the data ﬂows between CLO.
In 2006 the German Federal Government considered the general institution of monthly RS.
The implementation failed because of doubts of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly submission of VIES data to CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact – if the obligation of monthly RS and the monthly submission of VIES data should be effective – a monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly RS.
Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and Germany
As regards foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the CR.
The total quantities of intra-Community transactions in goods between the CR and Germany are set forth in Table No. 2.
The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.
These data are contained in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.
While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the CR: Procedure
International exchange of information helps tax administrators to obtain information from other Member States related to intra-Community business transactions and the taxpayers who carried out these transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 makes a distinction between two basic categories of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and exchange of information without a prior request.
International exchange of information on request is performed through a “request for information” (hereinafter “RFI”) using the standardised SCAC form.
Tax administrators in the CR communicate their RFI or answer a delivered RFI via the financial directorate to the CLO, which provides for translation of information entered in the standardised SCAC forms into the foreign language and their sending to other Member States.
The CLO also provides for receipt of RFI from other Member States and answers to sent RFI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the competent local tax administrators for processing.
Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 stipulates that the maximum period of time for processing RFI is 3 months from receipt of the request.
All RFI submitted during the audited period between the CR and Germany were subjected to SAO audit.
Out of the total number of 94 RFI received in the CR from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the set three-month deadline; a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline and, in the remaining 1 case, an answer had not been sent to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.
More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI received from Germany were sent from the CR is contained in Graph No. 2.
Of the total number of 335 RFI sent from the CR to Germany, an answer was sent in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the set three-month deadline, a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) of requests were answered after this deadline and, in 19 cases, an answer had not been sent from Germany at the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to identify on the basis of the data provided when the answer was delivered from Germany).
More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI were furnished from Germany to the CR is contained in Graph No. 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community transactions stated in RFI submitted between the CR and Germany are disclosed in Graph No. 4.
The above graph illustrates that the value of business transactions reviewed through RFI was most frequently in the range above EUR 60,000.
International exchange of information without a prior request occurs either by means of automatic or structured-automatic exchange of information, or by spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax administrators from other Member States often received information that might be important for VAT administration without a previous request.
In the CR, all the information is collected at the CLO.
Information is transferred electronically between the individual Member States.
“Automatic exchange” pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 refers to systematic communication of prespecified information to other Member States, without a prior request and at preset regular intervals.
“Structured-automatic exchange” refers to systematic communication of pre-specified information to other Member States without a previous request as soon as the relevant information is available.
The CR provides other Member States with information on supply of new means of transport via automatic exchange.
This information is available for the tax administrator from the form Report of the supply of a new means of transport pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.
In processing this form, the tax administrator enters the necessary data in a specially created template and immediately submits this to the contact employee at the financial directorate, where these data are collected and submitted to the CLO for subsequent processing. Then they are transferred to other Member States within a set deadline, i.e. by the latest within two months after the end of the quarter in which these data were available.
The CR also provides the other Member States with information on mail-order sales, which are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on operations within the EC that seem unauthorised and information on potential “missing traders”.
Such information is sent to other Member States via spontaneous exchange using a SCAC form.
International exchange of information in Germany: Procedure
In Germany the local tax office in charge initiates both requests for information and spontaneous information.
The tax office sends the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The tax offices are instructed to write their requests for information or their spontaneous information only in German; even the used SCAC form is monolingual.
Half of the German requests for information checked by the BRH were sent to ensure the taxation of an intra-Community acquisition in the other Member State and prove the tax exemption of the intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State respectively.
When the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks the amount of supplies mentioned in the request for the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000.
If there is no adequate reason for the request, the German CLO declines any request for an amount below this threshold.
Furthermore, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are neither in German nor English.
To answer the requests for information the CLO sends the request to the tax office in charge referring to the 3-month-time-limit.
There are no other deadlines set for processing the request on specific organisational levels of the tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor the elapsed time limits, it lacks the staff capacity to remind the tax offices of answering the incomplete requests for information.
The tax offices get the information required by sending a letter to the taxpayers or by conducting an audit.
The auditors usually chose between two different types of audits: A special VAT audit which covers any taxable process of a period of some months or a so called VAT inspection which can cover only one transaction which has been done recently.
This short and ﬂexible kind of audit does not require any notification of the taxpayer and it has been of merits to investigate a single taxable transaction.
In the context of the automatic exchange without a prior request Germany provides other Member States with information – about VAT IDs granted to entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States, – about the refund of input tax to those entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States.
Furthermore, Germany has committed itself to providing other EC Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:
a. The supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. supplies by distance or catalogue selling to other Member States which are not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between the intra-Community acquisitions declared by a taxpayer and the VIES data submitted by other Member States, d. intra-Community supplies of goods which the German taxpayer did not report in RS, because the supplies were treated as domestic transactions, e. potential “missing trader” which made intra-Community transactions independent of the validity of their VAT ID and f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential “missing traders” or recipients who misused their VAT ID.
Comparison and evaluation
Sending of RFI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the CR and Germany by competent local tax offices that send filed SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (CzechEnglish) and translates dispatched information into English or German language, respectively, German tax offices comply with the instruction, according to which they have to write RFI or spontaneous information exclusively in German on a single-language form.
The German CLO does not provide a translation of German texts.
When reviewing RFIs transmitted between the CR and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration settled 74,5 % of received RFIs in a given three months deadline, while RFIs sent to Germany were settled by the German tax administration in the given deadline in 40,6 % cases only.
Although the German CLO refers the tax offices to the 3-month-deadline it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.
The outcome of the missing reminders is the high quantity of delayed answers to RFIs.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended a steady reminding exercise of the CLO.
The situation has already improved.
According to our latest information the German CLO now reminds the Tos tax offices of answering the incompleted requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the CR
In the CR, several units at various organisational levels of the tax administration are concerned with VAT risk management.
Within the MoF, the following units are concerned with the aspect of risk management and combating VAT fraud:
VAT Methodology and Performance Department and, in its framework, the VAT Risk Management Unit that, i.a., manages the selection of risks of potential tax evasion and evaluates trends in these risks at a domestic and community level.
Nationally it coordinates the performance of the task of “Trustworthiness of VAT returns” and VIES data utilisation from the standpoint of tax evasion as part of intra-Community transactions.
On the basis of data on the trade balance of the CR it evaluates risky commodities, prepares VAT risk management conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and with other Member States.
The Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration that, i.a., provides for exchange of information in the area of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of an information database, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, provides for informing the public and for other forms of international cooperation in the sense of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed. 
These data are contained in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.
While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
The Methodology of Tax Control and Investigation Department that, i.a., performs risk analysis as part of methodological management of tax audits and, in accordance with risk analysis, establishes priorities for orientation of tax audits in the plans of the financial directorates, prepares risk analyses as part of reducing tax evasions including the collection of information obtained in tax administration and from other sources and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.
Investigation departments are established at the financial directorates and, i.a., look for tax entities and high-risk areas regarding tax fraud (i.e. internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), look for unregistered tax entities from the standpoint of tax evasion (e.g. in the area of internet services, mediation of work, radio and printing services, etc.), analysis of connections in chain frauds and provision of information to local financial authorities.
Specialised audit departments have been established at 12 selected tax offices.
They have regional competence and perform tax audits outside the territorial competence of the tax offices on the basis of authorization.
The need to establish specialised tax audit departments followed from the increasing number of determined new and advanced types of tax evasions that occurred particularly amongst entities connected in chains.
This department concentrates on audit of tax entities according to the requirements of the investigation departments, tax entities with specific activities and international companies and tax entities with a large scope of activities as regards the magnitude of turnover.
The following mechanisms used to reduce risks in the area of VAT were integrated into the ATIS system: – the task “Trustworthiness of VAT returns” for evaluating the risk level of submitted tax returns, – the task “Choice of tax entities for inspection”, enabling selection of taxpayers for audit on the basis of selected criteria, – the task “VIES”, through which the tax administrators have access to data provided from the other EC Member States.
The task “VIES” permits, i.a.: – verifying the validity of VAT ID of taxpayers from other Member States, – obtaining from other Member States the value of goods supplied to a Czech taxpayer, declared in the RS by all its suppliers in other Member States, – generating a list of taxpayers who did not submit RS, – performance of formal control of data that taxpayers in the CR entered in RS prior to sending these data to other Member States, – generating a list of taxpayers for which data on supply of goods to other Member States entered in their VAT returns does not coincide with RS data, – generating a list of taxpayers, for which the value of goods acquired from other Member States entered in VAT returns do not coincide with the data declared in the RS of all his suppliers from other Member States.
As part of activities to reduce the risk of tax evasion, tax staff have access to the registers of the state administrative authorities, such as the commercial index, real estate register, motor vehicle register, business license register, etc.
More detailed information is provided in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR.
Risk management in Germany
Because of the federal structure in Germany both the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 federal states participate in the development and the operation of RMSs.
Although there are joint working groups for the development neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the federal states share a completely consistent database.
At the level of the CLO unit ST I 2 (hereinafter the “KUSS“ – coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects audit findings on tax fraud in a separate database called OPUS.
KUSS established another database called ZAUBER in cooperation with the tax offices to communicate the names of discovered “missing traders” or VAT fraudsters.
KUSS coordinates both connected cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.
The experience gathered by KUSS is incorporated into the development of RMS in the working groups.
Furthermore, experts of several other units of the CLO and the MoF are entrusted with RMS duties and responsibilities.
At the level of the CLO, a formal control is done of the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in submitted RS of German taxpayers.
This formal control is processed before RS data are submitted to other Member States to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data submitted (see 4.4.2).
The verification of VAT IDs mentioned in RS is proven on the basis of O_MCTL-Codes submitted by other Member States (for the process of correcting an invalid VAT ID see also 4.4.2).
Furthermore, the RMS of the CLO is based on the VIES data transmitted by other Member States and it creates several types of inspection notes based on several characteristics usually found in carousel transactions to detect a potential “missing trader”.
The tax offices of the federal states are instructed to process these inspection notes and in some cases to report the result of their investigation to the CLO.
The audit findings of the BRH confirmed that it is necessary to include all available characteristics in order to be able to assume a case of tax fraud with a sufficient probability (instead of focussing on a company’s turnover only).
So the BRH suggested to the MoF to imply a mix of diverse characteristics for producing the reports.
The RMS should include other facts like the taxpayer’s payment behaviour, the (economic) branch or the shareholders.
A second level of RMS is processed by the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on processing of VAT returns.
RMS for example generates a list of those taxpayers who declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of RS.
Furthermore, this type of RMS compares the intra-Community acquisitions declared in the taxpayer’s annual VAT return with the data of the VIES-system.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data because this comparison would disclose too many mismatches which may attributed to other reasons than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
– differing times when the supplier and the acquirer thought the intra-Community transaction was carried out;
– differing accounting and declaring of sales discounts and incentives.
In addition to comparing the VAT return data and VIES data many federal states implemented components of RMS based on the data of VAT returns, and some other facts (like the composition of the firm‘s name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the taxpayer’s payment behaviour).
Bavaria implemented a rule-based RMS, permitting a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter the risk managers) to program their own rules to identify potential tax fraudsters.
This RMS is applied when the tax offices are processing the monthly VAT return.
So the tax office in charge receives suspected cases of the RMS before the VAT is fixed.
Since this RMS is not able to learn the risk managers have to adjust the rules on the basis of the feedback of the tax offices.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has programmed an adaptive neural network with the data of tax files in which an audit disclosed tax evasions.
Based on these data the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The RMS produces a list of tax files monthly, which are suspected of being involved in tax evasion.
On the basis of this list the tax offices in charge decide to audit the proposed taxpayers.
After the audit the auditors have to report their findings, so the RMS can learn from the results of its list.
North-Rhine Westphalia uses an adaptive neural network which is combined with a rule-based fuzzy-system.
Based on many data of assessed VAT returns and some other facts this neuro-fuzzy- or data mining system calculates the probability that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.
Afterwards it produces a monthly list of potential tax fraudsters.
Based on this list the local tax offices choose relevant taxpayers for an audit and report the audit findings to the data processing centre.
The implementation of any of these three RMS in other federal states is in progress.
Since none of these three RMS is based on the same approach a combination of all the systems seems to be useful for tackling tax fraud.
It will remain to be seen if such a system achieves the expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although specific criteria of the RMS of CR and Germany could not be discussed in this report, the SAO and the BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches of the three federal states in Germany the RMS of each European state has its own strengths and weaknesses.
The tax authorities of the European Member States currently discuss new tendencies and new models of crossborder VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – did not turn out to be a national but a European problem rather.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in several states.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State only.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS.
VAT loss caused by the Europe-wide fraud need not to affect the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.
Each Member State that is involved in the fraudulent activities can be affected.
So there should be a European exchange and discussion of RMS.
Selected audit findings on verification of commercial transactions
As part of the parallel audits the SAO and BRH reviewed the quality and use of information on selected business transactions that were subject to international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the CR and Germany.
In addition, the two audit institutions jointly reviewed several business transactions where there were doubts about their execution or discrepancies in the manner in which taxpayers in the two countries reported such business transactions in their VAT returns or RS.
At the request of the BRH, the SAO reviewed a total of 8 cases related to business transactions performed between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of notification by the BRH, the SAO reviewed the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, reported by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and RS.
Upon request from the SAO, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 cases related to business transactions performed between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Relevant information was exclusively exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 using official communication by the CLO.
The review of those selected cases revealed, i.a. that, the different ways of registration in the EC Member States cause problems as mentioned in chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 60,500.
When the Czech taxpayer declared acquisition of goods at a value corresponding to only EUR 29,869 the Czech tax administration sent a request to Germany for verification of the value of the supplied goods.
The German party stated in the answer to the RFI delivered from Germany that, in the 2nd quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 27,381, in the 3rd quarter at a value of EUR 31,997 and, in the 4th quarter, at a value of EUR 10,276.
It further followed from the answer that the VAT ID of the German taxpayer was valid only from 28 September 2004 but, on the basis of an additional request by the German taxpayer for certification of the validity of VAT ID, in 2006 the German CLO retroactively issued a certificate with validity of the VAT ID from 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the RS.
On the basis of this information, this was a case of acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted additional VAT returns for the individual taxable periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of the goods acquired from other Member States and simultaneously made claims for deduction of VAT on acquisition of goods from other Member States.
However, the Czech tax administrator could not unambiguously determine from these additional VAT returns whether they also include the value of supplies from the above-mentioned German supplier.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, because he did not request the allocation of a VAT ID on registration, he was allocated only an identification number for transactions in Germany.
Although it is not usually possible to allocate a taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively in Germany, in this case, in 2006 the German tax official assigned to this German taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delay of the allocation; for example if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer’s application of a VAT ID.
In this case the CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not provide an own valid VAT ID for an intra-Community supply according to § 6 UStG.
Vice versa a German recipient does not provide a valid VAT ID of his supplier to declare an intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these different processes between the Member States the German CLO allocated VAT ID retroactively in this special case.
2.
As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested review of the VAT registration of the German taxpayer.
VIES gives a registration date of 5 March 2005, while the date 1 October 2004 is given in the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer issued by the competent local German tax office.
The German authorities stated in the answer sent from Germany that the German tax entity was registered on 1 October 2004, but that, for organisational reasons, he was allocated a VAT ID in Germany only on 16 February 2005.
Through a question sent to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator performed a VAT audit at the Czech taxpayer for the taxation periods of the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 2nd quarter of 2005.
In this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer included in his VAT return services at a value of CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. prior to 1 October 2004).
The tax office subsequently assessed VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60) for the tax entity for the taxation period of the 3rd quarter of 2004.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the VAT ID was allocated to the German taxpayer only on 16 February 2005, when he informed the tax office about his business which was started in 2004.
Furthermore the tax office registered him retroactively for VAT as 1 October 200415 to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return of the year 2004.
In this VAT return the taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisitions from CR in the amount of EUR 160 (» CZK 5,000).
3. In the VAT return for September 2004 and RS for the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer declared the supply of goods at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to a German taxpayer.
In reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. after supply of the goods to Germany by the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared a tax base for performed domestic supplies at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which he paid.
Through a question to the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted a request for renewal of the proceedings in the matter of the additional VAT return and, as evidence, submitted the statement of the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered for taxes since 1 January 2000.
Consequently, the Czech tax administrator reviewed the validity of registration of the German taxpayer as part of international exchange of information.
It followed from the answer delivered from Germany that the German taxpayer was allocated a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of supply of the goods.
Consequently, the tax administrator in the CR rejected the request for renewal of the proceedings.
The BRH found that, in this case, intra-Community acquisition of goods was not involved because the German taxpayer obtained a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and he declared VAT on this intra-Community acquisition, as he demanded the refund of the input VAT in the same amount.
Since there would be no change in VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.
The BRH further found that the name of the German taxpayer mentioned in the RFI was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, as a consequence of which there was confusion between two German tax entities.
This change of the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax administrator.
4.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005, at a value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that this administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer in which he reviewed whether the supply of the goods was performed and whether the Czech taxpayer entered the invoice for these goods in the accounts and paid it.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID in the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German taxpayer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21 April 2005, i.e. after performance of the supply to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech tax administrator also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer so that, if required, he could take steps to assess taxes.
The Czech tax office assessed this business transaction as acquisition of goods from a nontaxpayer in Germany and thus did not subsequently assess taxes for the Czech taxpayer from this business transaction.
The BRH found that, according to the German legislation, for a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States there is no need for a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.
The supplier must only have the VAT ID of the acquirer in the other Member State and must be capable of demonstrating transport of the given goods to the other Member State.
Thus, according to the German VAT law, this was an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the CR.
Anyway it is important that the Czech tax administrator took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of that value was not the German supplier’s core business.
As described in chapter 4.6.2 the German CLO declines to answer RFIs which are applied to intra-Community transactions if the amount is less than the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000:
5. According to VIES data in the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods from the German taxpayer at a value of EUR 12,561.
The Czech tax administrator performed a tax audit of the tax entity for this taxable period.
As part of international cooperation, the Czech tax administration requested review of supply of these goods via a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he did not receive the goods, that he had never done business with the German company and that the acquisition of these goods was not entered in his accounts.
The German tax administration rejected the request for provision of evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, stating that the turnover did not exceed the amount of EUR 15,000 and no other explanations were given.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence for retrospective tax assessment on the goods acquired, the tax audit ended without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a “fiscal representative” (§ 22 (a) – (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer reported these supplies in its annual VAT return and in the RS.
His right to exemption of the supplies was recognised.
On the basis of notification by the BRH, the German tax office will send documents to the CR, required for subsequent assessment of taxes on the acquired goods.
It was shown in chapter 4.6.1 that replies to RFIs sent by the German tax administration exceeded the 3-monthtime limit more often than replies of the Czech tax administration:
6. SAO found in the audit that, on 5 October 2005 the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany, related to reviewing the value of goods supplied in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the RS for this period, the German taxpayer declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the value of EUR 86,307; however, for the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared in the VAT return only the acquisition of goods for a value corresponding to EUR 35,314.
In the answer to the RFI delivered to the CR on 9 May 2006, i.e. following expiry of the deadline for processing, stipulated in Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the request could not be processed, as the operation of the German company was terminated at the end of 2005.
Since the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the RFI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for the tax proceedings in the CR.
7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested - via a SCAC form - review of a supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 1,265,554, performed in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2004 since the transaction showed characteristics of carousel fraud.
The SAO found that an answer to the RFI had not been received from Germany at the time of the audit.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer did not include in his VAT return the supplies of new means of transportation for this German taxpayer at a value of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 37 5,472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the tax return information and the Czech tax entity submitted a corrected RS.
On the basis of the request by the SAO, the BRH found that, for technical reasons, the German CLO did not transfer this RFI to the competent local tax office for review.
Following notification by the BRH, an audit was performed at the German acquirer in Germany, which provided evidence that the acquisition of all the automobiles was properly taxed and that the relevant automobiles were sold to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. According to VIES data in the 4th quarter of 2004 the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car from the German taxpayer, at a value of EUR 48,500.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare acquisition of these goods.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer has not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not submit tax returns even after being invited to do so by the tax administrator; consequently, on 23 May 2005, the tax office assessed VAT for the period from October to December 2004 in the amount of CZK 0.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO referred to this supply from a German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the administrator sent a RFI to Germany in relation to the above-mentioned supply.
As the answer to the RFI was delivered only on 7 February 2007, it was not known by the time of completion of the SAO’s audit in which way the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by international exchange.
Because of failure to comply with obligations following from the Act on VAT, registration for VAT was cancelled for the Czech taxpayer as of 23 August 2005.
In some cases only a partial reply was sent because the audit carried out by tax offices at taxpayers was not finished at the time of the audit of the SAO and BRH:
9.
In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 16,991 performed in the 3rd quarter of 2004, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.
In his answer to the RFI, the German tax administrator stated that he had available only the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for supplies at a value of EUR 16,335.
On the basis of the request from the SAO, the BRH found that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods at a value of EUR 16,335 twice, in the tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.
10.
In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supplies of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 198,167, performed in the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial answer to the RFI to the CR, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer acquired several automobiles and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The SAO found that the competent local tax office performed several local investigations at the Czech supplier for the purpose of reviewing the claim of excessive VAT deductions, in which it did not find unauthorised claiming.
The BRH found that in this period the German taxpayer declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of EUR 579,114 and that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany has still not yet been completed.
In chapter 4.4.1 the reasons of mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient’s VAT return and the data of the RS of the supplier are described.
The audited cases showed that temporary mismatches or the improper declaration of a transaction as an intra-Community supply of goods in RS were not the most frequent causes for the deviations:
11.
According to data from the VIES system, in the 1st quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods at a value of EUR 35,716 from the German taxpayer; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and no activities were performed in the registered seat of the company, the Czech tax administrator requested, as part of international exchange of information, review of the way in which the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.
The answer to the RFI delivered from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and an agreed transporter accepted the goods.
The order was for the total sum of EUR 155,000 but the German taxpayer supplied only goods at a value of EUR 21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer false confirmation of payment of the sum of EUR 155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
Following identification of the fraudulent conduct on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer managed to reobtain the supplied material, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, with the exception of one item at a value of EUR 7,916.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the tax administration, i.a., on the basis of the obtained information, subsequently assessed the Czech taxpayer VAT for the goods acquired from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).
On the basis of an inquiry from the SAO, the BRH confirmed that, following corrections, the German supplier declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of only EUR 7,916.
According to the German legal situation the German taxpayer declared the reclaim of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter of the reclaim.
So his RS contained the following declarations concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administration requested, through a SCAC form, review of supply of goods and provision of services, performed in the 3rd quarter of 2005.
According to this RFI in this period, the Czech taxpayer had supplied goods to the German taxpayer at a total value of EUR 396,126 and had provided services at a value of EUR 11,885.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administration performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer for the purpose of reviewing this supply.
In response to the RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that the Czech taxpayer supplied the German taxpayer with a production line, including assembly.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production line prior to accession of the CR to the EC and the line was assembled after May 1, 2004 on the basis of an order.
The German taxpayer did not accept the assembled line because of asserted defects.
In the 3rd quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer issued an invoice to the German taxpayer for the sum of EUR 107,100 for assembly and EUR 11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer accepted the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that all the invoices were properly entered in the accounts of the Czech taxpayer.
VAT returns for the 3rd quarter of 2005 contain only those amounts that were documented by the Czech taxpayer and that were related to invoicing after May 1, 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the answer from the Czech tax administration, the competent local tax office arrived at the conclusion that those transactions were a consistent supply of goods from the Czech taxpayer to the German taxpayer including the service of the assembly.
In this special case, the place of this so-called work supply is where the production line is assembled.
The German recipient of the work supply is obliged to pay the VAT according to the German VAT law.
Simultaneously, the recipient may apply for deduction of VAT in the same amount.
As there would be no changes in the VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, corrections in the tax return were neglected by the German tax office.
13. According to VIES data, in February 2005 Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine from German taxpayer C at a value of EUR 58,000.
The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany for review of this information.
In answer to the RFI, the German party stated that German taxpayer C supplied that machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he returned the machine to German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transferred back to Germany, but was transported to the organisational unit of German taxpayer C in the CR.
It further followed from the answer to the RFI that, in February 2005, German taxpayer C sold the machine to Czech taxpayer A.
This taxpayer received the machine in the seat of the organisational unit of the German taxpayer in the CR.
As the supply was performed only within the CR, this did not constitute an intra-Community supply of goods.
By means of a question to the tax administrator in charge of taxpayer B, the SAO found that according to VIES data, German taxpayer C supplied goods to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004 (another machine), at a value of EUR 88,027.
Taxpayer B stated that he did not receive these goods and these the competent local tax administrator in the CR sent a RFI to Germany.
According to the answer to this request, the machine was supplied.
In a further investigation at taxpayer B, the Czech tax administrator found that the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 was not entered in the accounts of taxpayer B and that this could be a machine of the same kind as was supplied by the organisational unit of German taxpayer C to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The SAO further found that the Czech tax administrator competent local for taxpayer A performed a local investigation concerning this taxpayer.
The tax administrator had the invoice of German taxpayer C of 7 February 2005, in which taxpayer A is stated as the customer for the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found that taxpayer A had not entered this invoice in his accounts.
Taxpayer A had concluded a leasing agreement with another Czech company, where the subject of the leasing was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company supplied the machine on 9 February 2005 and the leasing company provided for the transport of the machine.
The Czech tax office failed to use the information contained in the answer to the request for information for assessing the tax obligation of taxpayer A.
The BRH found that German taxpayer C did not supply the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 to the CR, but to another German taxpayer D.
Thus, this did not constitute intra-Community supply of goods, but taxable supply in Germany.
Consequently, the German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of German taxpayer C to exemption from VAT and corrected the data in his tax return.
The German taxpayer D supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
According to the German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the CR.
BRH further found that, in his RS for the 1st quarter of 2005, German taxpayer C entered the supply of a machine at a value of EUR 58,000 to Czech taxpayer A.
This supply was not reviewed during the tax audit performed by the German tax office.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships between participants of the above mentioned business transactions.
14.
Auditing received RFIs, SAO found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration received an RFI from Germany, in which a German tax administrator requested confirmation of intra-Community supply from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer.
According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that that was a case of fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.
It was further stated in the RFI that the German taxpayer had not done any active business since 1999.
SAO stated that the Czech tax administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer.
The executive of the Czech company stated that the above-mentioned case was probably a claim of the German taxpayer in relation to the German tax administration that was set up by the Czech taxpayer as a shareholder in the German company at the German tax office.
According to information provided to the SAO, to the present time the Czech tax administrator has not had any information that the German tax administration is processing the matter in relation to the Czech taxpayer.
The available information indicates that this was not a case of supply of goods; nonetheless, this value is still included in the VIES system as intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech taxpayer from Germany.
The most important reason for those discrepancies was that the recipients did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, a German taxpayer supplied goods to a Czech taxpayer in a total value of EUR 33,205 in the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
The Czech tax administrator requested review of the supply of the goods from Germany as part of international exchange of information.
In its answer to this request, the German party stated that the German taxpayer sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the Czech taxpayer picked up the remaining goods in person.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, prior to obtaining an answer to the RFI, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for this period.
In spite of this submission, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved and thus the Czech tax administrator recommended that a tax audit be performed at the Czech taxpayer.
The audit has not been carried out yet.
16. According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004 a German taxpayer supplied to a Czech taxpayer goods at a value of EUR 46,854.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisition of goods only in an amount corresponding to the sum of EUR 14,856.
As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator asked for a review of the amount of the actual supply.
In the response to this request delivered from Germany, 3 invoices were provided, with a total stated value of supplied goods of EUR 31,999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the data in the VIES system.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, following receipt of the answer from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and they agreed that, after reviewing these invoices with the owner of the company, she would discuss the submission of an additional VAT return for the 3rd quarter of 2004.
By now, the additional tax return was not submitted.
The Czech tax administrator informed the SAO that he would proceed so as to comply with the set deadlines for any retroactive assessment of VAT for the relevant taxation period.
17.
In the 4th quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 11,600.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested confirmation of whether the Czech taxpayer actually existed, because the alleged shareholder of the German taxpayer established a number of fictitious companies in Germany.
During reviewing of the business transaction by the tax office, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.
However, according to a statement by the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the CR and were further sold in Germany during 2005.
The Czech taxpayer submitted documents on sale of the goods in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered in Germany as a VAT payer and did not declare or pay taxes for the sale of the relevant goods neither in the CR nor Germany.
All these facts indicated tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated these facts to the German tax administration in the answer to the RFI.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of a performed investigation, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of goods acquired, i.a. from a German taxpayer and simultaneously exercised the right to tax deduction in acquisition of goods from other Member States.
He did not enter VAT on sale of goods in Germany to the Czech VAT return.
The Czech tax administrator assessed an additional VAT return following the local investigation without any changes.
According to the Czech legislation, the case in question did not consist in acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not sent or transported from another Member State to the CR.
Thus, the Czech tax administrator drew an erroneous conclusion in the local investigation.
The BRH found that, immediately after receiving the answer to the RFI, stating that the goods did not leave Germany, the German tax administrator corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and requested payment of VAT of EUR 1,600.
Furthermore, the competent tax office sent a hint to the tax office of the real recipient of the goods to ensure that the further sale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases taxpayers declared intra-Community transactions, which were probably not realised in fact:
18.
The Czech tax administrator obtained a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car at a value of EUR 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request included an annex consisting in a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.
It also included a copy of the passport of the person who was said to have performed the transport of this automobile.
The Czech tax administrator found in the investigation that this was a stolen passport, that the person mentioned in it did not import any vehicle into the CR and he stated that he did not have any contacts with a German tax entity.
The Czech tax administrator never issued the certificate of VAT registration, whose copy was sent by the German party.
The Czech tax administrator entered these data in the answer to the RFI together with the fact that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the goods – the automobile in question.
Through a question to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer does not have his seat at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the executive of the company could not be contacted.
After performance of a tax objection proceeding for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer tax obligation in the amount of CZK 0.
In a further investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the relevant automobile was sold to a further Czech entity, who purchased it through an Internet advertisement.
BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech answer to the RFI, the competent local German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer to VAT exemption for this supply.
19. During an audit a German tax office was not able to clarify a difference of EUR 3,000 between the amount of acquired goods declared in the taxpayer’s tax return and the amount submitted from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer was said to have supplied goods at a value of EUR 89,424 to a German taxpayer during the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested review of supplies and their payment as part of international exchange of information.
In the answer to the RFI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the single executive for the Czech company had been erased from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and a new executive had not been entered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative to the shareholder in the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer submitted a VAT return and a RS that, following deletion of the executive from the Commercial Register, was signed by an unauthorised person – this shareholder in the company.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer told the tax administrator that the shareholder in the company deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR to the account of the company.
Cash documents were not drawn up.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax office, the SAO in the CR found that the tax administrator recognised that the Czech taxpayer had the right to exemption from VAT for supply of goods to other Member States in the value of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) for the 1st quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548) for the 1st quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer because a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer in the meantime.
Since the earlier audit did not detect any signs for tax fraud there would not be any chance to recover an assessed VAT liability.
20. According to VIES data in the year 2005 a German taxpayer acquired goods from CR in the amount of EUR 4,251,196 after he had acquired goods in the amount of EUR 43,274 in the previous year.
Neither in his VAT return of 2004 nor in his VAT return of 2005 did the German taxpayer declare intraCommunity acquisitions.
Furthermore, he did not declare any proportionate supplies.
Because of these differences the German tax office started an RFI concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the RS for these two quarters a Czech supplier declared intra-Community supplies of goods in a total value of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).
On 6 September 2006, the RFI was delivered, in which the German party requested review of whether the intra-Community supply declared by the Czech taxpayer had actually occurred.
In the answer to this RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that it was not possible to comply with the German request because the Czech taxpayer did not have an executive.
As can be seen from the documents provided to SAO by the relevant tax administrator, a protocol was drawn up with the executive of the Czech taxpayer on 30 March 2006 on commencement of VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and for January to December 2005.
The taxpayer was simultaneously invited by the tax administrator to submit all the accounting and tax documents for that period, but he did not submit any documents.
According to the Commercial Register, the functional term of the sole executive ended as of 16 May 2005 but a new executive was not appointed.
The Czech taxpayer ceased submitting VAT returns in April 2006.
As part of this audit, the SAO reviewed jointly with the BRH several cases of intra-Community supplies performed between the CR and Germany that were not subject to previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.
The two supreme audit institutions shared information on the reviewed cases via CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany informed the competent tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it was going to accomplish taxable transactions in Germany.
Because of this information the company has been registered since June 2005 but it did not get a German VAT ID.
The (eCR) accepted an order of a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) to manufacture several wind power stations and to deliver those wind power stations on behalf, at risk and for account of the Danish customer to Austria.
For lack of sufficient capacities of its own the Czech company passed a part of the order to a German taxpayer (eD) who is resident in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the way of transport of the wind power stations:
According to the German legal situation the place of these transactions has to be determined as described in the following:
– The Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent the wind power stations for assembly in his name, at his risk and for his own account to Austria.
Because of the assembly his supply takes place in Austria – the supply of the wind power stations is taxable in Austria.
– Since the forwarding agent was instructed by the Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport was on his behalf, on his risk and for his own account, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) takes place where the transport started – in Germany.
Although the wind power stations have been sent to another EC Member State (A) and the recipient is a registered taxpayer of an EC Member State (CR) the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not gain any tax exemption because the EC Member State of destination differs from the EC Member State of the residence of the Czech company.
So this supply is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCR) deducted the input VAT in its tax returns.
The place of the supply of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by where the transport started.
However the transport of some wind power stations started in the CR and of some others in Germany.
– The supply of those wind power stations, which are manufactured in the CR, takes place in the CR.
– The supply of the other wind power stations, which are manufactured in Germany, takes place in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) delivered both intra-Community supplies from the CR to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that neither the Czech company (eCR) declared any intra-Community acquisitions in its German tax return nor submitted a RS to the German CLO.
So it may be possible that the Czech company declared all the intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the CR.
The SAO found that the eCR did not declare any intra-Community supplies to Austria but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.
To provide evidence for the taxation of the intra-Community acquisitions in Austria the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, the Czech, the Danish and the German) would be required although that case does not show any sign of tax fraud or of tax evasion.
Furthermore, the SAO and the BRH reviewed transactions to show the size of the differences between the declarations in the VAT return and the VIES data caused by the different legal provisions of VAT in 2004.
The reviewed cases demonstrate also that a change in these legal provisions takes time until the taxpayers and the tax offices apply the new legislation:
22. In the RS for the 2nd to 4th quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer declared supply of goods to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).
In the same period, another Czech taxpayer declared in its RS intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total amount of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).
Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.
Both Czech taxpayers stated the above-mentioned supplies in their RS in accordance with Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.
In a further review of these transactions, an audit group from the SAO found that there were differences in legislation on supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the CR and Germany in 2004.
While, in the CR, taxpayers declared the supply of electrical energy in accordance with the applicable statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as intra-Community supply of goods, on the basis of German legislation applicable in 2004, this did not correspond to intra-Community acquisition of goods, but rather to taxable transaction with place of transaction in the territory of Germany.
Differences in the legislation were eliminated in the CR by adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll. amending some laws to comply with the administrative fees act effective as from 1 January 2005.
23. A review of selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with the BRH, showed that a Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community supplies to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) in his RS for the 1st and 4th quarters of 2005, and that another Czech taxpayer declared, in the RS for the same period, intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).
Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.
Pursuant to statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective as from 1 January 2005, in the case of supply of electrical energy, the place of transaction is the place where the acquirer has his registered office, the place of business or where he has his commercial premises for which these goods are supplied.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have entered the supplies of electrical energy in their RS in 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers declared intra-Community supply of electricity in their RS led to distortion of data in VIES by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).
Conclusion
The cooperation achieved the objectives of BRH and SAO.
Both SAI obtained a deeper knowledge of the systems of administration of VAT in the CR and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences of the two systems and disclosed that the legal provisions governing VAT administration vary.
During the parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.
Some of them merit further review.
On the basis of audit findings, both SAI produced recommendations on VAT administration.
To monitor implementation of these recommendations and to review the above mentioned cases a follow-up audit should be conducted..
The new experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of both audit institutions are the basis for successful accomplishment of future audit missions of VAT administration.
