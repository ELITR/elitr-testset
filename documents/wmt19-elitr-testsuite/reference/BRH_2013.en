Procurement of public building and corruption prevention
Joint report on parallel audit submitted by the Czech Supreme Audit Ofice (NKÚ) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (BRH)
Introduction and overview
The procurement of goods and services by public-sector contracting agencies is of great importance both for the government and for the business community.
The government’s task is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), public contract awarding is key to the success of the single economic area.
In order to ensure a largely unrestricted competition in the field of crossborder procurement, awarding authorities also have to meet certain requirements imposed by the EU in awarding contracts where the contract value exceeds certain thresholds.
To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose EU procurement law into their national law and apply it.
This has already happened both in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
For contracts worth less than the EU thresholds, regulating public contract awarding procedures remains a matter for the individual countries.
Moreover, the contract award procedure is, as a rule, vulnerable to corruption.
In view of the generally high damage potential, awarding authorities are obliged to take reasonable action to fight and to rule out corruption and abusive favouritism in their contract award procedures (corruption prevention).
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI – NKÚ) and the Bundesrechnungshof of Germany (German SAI – BRH) agreed to conduct parallel audits both of the EU-wide awarding of building contracts and of corruption prevention.
The audit focused on the application of EU procurement law as transposed into national law and corruption prevention of contracts for building construction and road construction and/or transport infrastructure.
The audit also covered contract awards below the EU thresholds with a view to corruption prevention.
The two SAIs’ audit findings are summarised in the joint report, which is also to be addressed to international institutions such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Fields of audit and audited bodies
The assessments performed by the German SAI are for the most part based on horizontal audits of the above-mentioned topics, which we carried out at German building authorities responsible for federal road and building construction in the years 2011–2012.
This included e.g. the construction of motorways and large building construction projects.
In addition to that, the German SAI included findings from previous audits in the assessment.
The assessments performed by the Czech SAI were based on audit findings generated in the years 2008–2012. The audits covered the construction of roads, railway lines, hydraulic engineering projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural buildings, universities, etc.), and some other areas in the Czech Republic.
Federal contract award procedures in Germany are largely conducted by the construction administrations of the countries.
In the Czech Republic, the road and estimate construction administrations of the State have central responsibilities for awarding contracts relating to transport infrastructure.
In building construction, responsibility for contract award procedures is decentralised, i.e. the procedures are conducted by the entities which receive state budget funds.
In both countries, the services of self-employed professionals are used in individual stages of contract award procedures.
When comparing the assessments, differences in procurement legislation and structural peculiarities of the construction services and markets of both countries have to be observed.
Structure of procurement law in the two countries
In Germany, the conduct of EU-wide contract award procedures is governed by Acts of Parliament and delegated legislation.
Contract award procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and administrative regulations based on it .
Many supplementary provisions both for EU-wide and national contract awards are contained in internal administrative rules.
Further details concerning the requirements of EU procurement law and corruption prevention are set forth in the socalled “contract award manuals” of the Federal Government, in which the requirements are complemented or formulated in greater detail taking regard to judicial precedent in the field of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, contract award procedure is governed exclusively by the respective Act on Public Procurement and other legal provisions, which apply to contract values both above and below the EU thresholds.
Procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new provisions strengthened transparency in the management of public funds, opened the way for more competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the contract award procedures.
Basic features of procurement law in the two countries
In both countries, especially the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be applied where contracts are to be awarded EU-wide.
In Germany, contracts below the EU threshold are awarded in accordance with the national procedures (public invitation to tender, restricted invitation to tender, negotiated contract), which, however, are aforementioned procedures. largely identical with the EU-wide contract award.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for the open procedure (where tenders have to be invited EU-wide) and for the public invitation to tender (in case of merely national contract awards).
Under the open procedure and the public invitation to tender, every interested enterprise may submit a bid.
Another essential feature of German procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
This is achieved mainly by dividing an overall public works project in trade-specific lots and part lots.
By awarding separate contracts for these lots, as many enterprises as possible, are to be given the chance to compete.
The two aforementioned characteristics of German procurement are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.
More than 330,000 construction firms with workforce of 1.9 mil. are registered in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide contract award procedures are also to be applied to public works contracts below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure below threshold, where the contracting authorities may under certain conditions use considerably less strict procedure.
In agreement with EU law, Czech procurement law includes provisions according to which contracts are to be concluded, if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is obtained.
The present Czech legislation enables contracting authorities to choose between open and restricted procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there are about 85,000 registered building companies, out of it 1,900 building contractors with 20 or more workers each.
Aggregate volume of public works contracts awarded by contracting agencies and shares of contract award types in the two countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany totalled € 307 billion.
Of these, € 45.5 billion (equivalent to 15 per cent) were accounted for by public contracts which, apart from contracts awarded by the Federal Government, included contracts awarded by the Federal States and municipalities.
The total volume of federal building and road construction projects (without railway construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to € 8.5 billion.
In 2011, the breakdown of federal contracts for building construction and construction of longdistance roads by type of award procedure was as follows:
80.7 % Open procedures and public invitations to tender 12.7 % Restricted procedures and restricted invitations to tender 6.6 % Negotiated procedures and discretionary awarding of contracts 33.2 % of which were EU-wide tenders.
In 2011, the volume of public works in the Czech Republic totalled € 4.7 billion, which accounts for about 25 per cent of the total volume of all building works in the Czech Republic.
In 2009 the volume reached € 7.8 billion e.g. 37% of the total volume of public works.
Structure of types of awards in 2011: 65,1 % open procedure 14,3 % restricted procedure 9,5 % negotiated procedure 8,4 % simplified procedure for awards below the threshold 2.7 % other procedures
The data comprise all public contracts for supplies, services and construction works awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on an important part of public contract awarding; corruption prevention, that always has to be observed when awarding contracts, has a significant financial impact and the open procedure and/or open tendering are of key importance when awarding contracts.
Summary of the basic results
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Supreme Audit Institution of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits of EU-wide awarding of public works contracts and corruption prevention in their respective countries.
In this context, the working groups of the two SAIs compared the legal frameworks and administrative regulations in the Czech Republic and in Germany and the results of their parallel audits which they conducted specifically in the fields of building construction and road construction.
The key findings were:
The EU Directives on the awarding of public works contracts have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (items 1 and 3.1).
Corruption prevention is not only the purpose of the EU Directives but also of the national procurement rules of both countries, which partly differ as to their points of emphasis and degree of detail.
In both countries, an essential requirement to be met by the tender documents is that they have to include all information needed for appropriately drawing up bids.
The specifications must be neutral and not include any requirements that restrict competition.
The tender documents in Germany largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic the problem of determining the subject of the contract largely exists.
In Germany, public works are to be divided into lots whenever possible in order to promote competition.
According to the BRH’s findings, this requirement was largely met in Germany.
The NKÚ’s audits showed that awarding large volumes of public road works without division into lots or division in only very large lots may impair competition and result in a restriction to only a few large companies.
These restrictions of market potential may result in major cost increases and bear the risk of undue price negotiations and collusion.
Legal provisions of both countries enable, under certain conditions, the contracting authorities to award contracts of additional or modified construction works if the need for this arises after concluding the contract (item 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely complied with in both countries.
According to the provisions of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities may freely choose between open and restricted procedures.
In contrast, the relevant German provisions in procurement and budgetary law stipulate the precedence of the open procedure both for EU-wide tenders and for national tenders known as public invitations to tender.
This enables more enterprise to submit bids.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price-fixing by collusion of bidders difficult and produces the best results in terms of value for money.
In the case of major work projects whose estimated total value reached or exceeded a threshold set by the EU, the contracting authorities audited always applied Europe-wide tendering procedures.
When determining the type of award procedure, the correct estimation of the contract value is of essential importance.
In Germany, databases for objective setting estimated public works prices are used, especially in the area of building construction.
The data is based on evaluations of construction projects already completed.
In the Czech Republic, the databases are used only in the area of road construction, but they are not efficient tool as yet (item 4.2).
Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, prior information and contract notices have to be published. This is to strengthen competition by allowing interested enterprises to prepare at an early stage for submitting bids.
Kontrolovaní zadavatelé zpravidla tento požadavek plnili.
V ojedinělých případech byly zjištěny omyly ve zveřejněných informacích, nesprávná aplikace požadavků a nedostatek kontrol, což mohlo konkurenci poškodit (bod 4.3).
The selection of bidders for participation in restricted award procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of bidders invited must be sufficiently high to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.
In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries are to alternate as frequently as possible among the enterprises to be invited when selecting participants.
In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to counteract the risk of manipulation.
In some cases, the audited bodies did not take regard to the requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the selection decisions made were not always plausible (item 4.4).
In both countries, the contracting authorities have to ensure, during the tender stage, that all enterprises interested in submitting a tender receive identical information.
To avoid collusion that would restrict competition, any contacts among these enterprises and between them and independent professionals that were involved in drawing up the specifications have to be prevented to the greatest extent possible.
The corresponding provisions in Germany are more extensive than those in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited construction administrations in Germany did not comply with requirements in some cases (item 4.5).
In both countries, the opening of the bids must comply with the cross-check and transparency principles.
The requirements for the marking, documentation, preservation and secrecy of the bids are to restrict the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The audits in both countries revealed only few deficiencies (item 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the bids are regulated in both countries by requirements for structural organisation and procedures.
The respective German rules are more comprehensive but were not always, complied with by the audited contracting authorities.
For instance, contracting authorities passed bids on to third parties for examination without first inspecting them and without adequately documenting any conspicuous feature.
The bids were thus inadequately protected against subsequent manipulations (item 4.7).
On completion of EU-wide contract award procedures, the participating předem informováni. Důvodem je dát účastníkům řízení možnost nechat přezkoumat rozhodnutí o udělení zakázky.
Toto pravidlo právní ochrany je rovněž určeno k zabránění korupčních aktivit.
Česká právní úprava řeší otázku právního přezkoumání zadávacího řízení i u národních řízení.
Pouze v ojedinělých případech nebylo plnění informačních povinností náležitě zabezpečeno. (bod 4.8).
The documentation of the contract award procedures by the audited construction authorities in the two countries was not always complete or plausible.
In the case of some procedures, the transparency requirement, which applies throughout the EU, had not been adequately observed in the contract award memos.
Moreover, some of the deficiencies found diminished the corruption prevention effect of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting duties (item 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU procurement law and corruption prevention
European procurement law
In order to guarantee free competition and free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts) and the Directive on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply and public works contracts (Remedies Directive), that were to be transposed into national law.
In particular, the general procurement principles of the European Union include the competition requirement, the equal treatment requirement or prohibition of discrimination and the transparency requirement.
To accomplish these objectives, the Directive on the coordination of EU-wide procedures for the award of contracts includes provisions relative to construction projects the expected order total of which reaches or exceeds € 5 million.
Such provisions impact especially on the contents of tender documents, the applicable type of procedure, the publication of certain information prior to, during and after the contract award procedure, the compliance with the deadlines for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the contract award dokumentaci celého zadávacího řízení; the qualification requirements that may be imposed on tenderers and the criteria according to which a tender is selected.
The tenderers’ legal protection is governed by the Remedies Directive.
In the case of potential breaches of procurement law, enterprises may have the contracting authority’s decision reviewed within review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union Directives into national law.
Corruption prevention
Significance of corruption prevention
In neither country is there a legal definition of what constitutes corruption.
In general, corruption is understood to mean the misuse of a position of confidence for private advantage.
As a rule, it is implied that such abuse is incited by those who benefit from it.
Corruption may hamper competition and may cause substantial economic damage.
According to estimates, global costs caused by corruption, amount to 5 % of the global economic output.
For the European Union area, these costs are estimated at an amount equivalent of 1 % of the area’s economic output.
If the contracting authority is involved, agreements restricting competition or unfair behaviour may undermine confidence in the integrity and the capability of the public administration to function.
Thus, preventing corruption is an essential task for awarding authorities.
Practices and procedures are to be reviewed to adress areas that are especially vulnerable to corruption so that appropriate anticorruption measures can be taken.
Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls may substantially reduce vulnerability of decision-making processes to corruption.
As a rule, the awarding of works contracts is considered to be particularly vulnerable to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption is prosecuted under penal and employment law, this especially applies to active and passive bribery and to the undue acceptance of benefits and undue granting of benefits.
In order to prevent corruption, the German Federal Government issued a guideline together with recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration , according to which, in addition to risk analyses, the following principles shall apply to contract award procedures: precedence of open tendering multiple control principle and transparent decision-making separation of planning, awarding of contracts and accounting precise and full documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further provisions having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of procurement law.
In 2011, the federal department responsible introduced an IT-supported system to monitor the awarding of federal road construction contracts.
By means of this system, procurement data, e.g. estimated costs, order total and private independent professionals involved, can be fully recorded and analysed with a view to finding irregularities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is similiarly prosecuted under penal and employment law.
The legal requirements of transparency, equal treatment of bidders and prohibition of any discrimination are the most important bases of corruption prevention.
Anti-corruption measures in the area of public procurement have been set down by the government in a strategy on fight against corruption for 2011–2012 which was updated for 2013–2014.
Some parts of these measures were already incorporated into public procurement law and respective implementing regulations.
The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions decrease of contracts for small scale obligation of prior contract award announcement by the contracting authority, including the reasons of the contract prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus impossibility of limiting the number of tenderers based on drawing obligation of publishing the contract awarded, including the supplements obligation of publishing the real price and the list of sub-contractors
Audit results related to the successive phases of the contract award procedure
Tender documents
Tender documents The tender documents must include all information which the bidders need for preparing their tenders in due form.
In particular, the tender documents must permit accurate costing.
To ensure this, bidders must not be burdened with risks they cannot calculate.
The tender documents mainly consist of the specifications. They also include the requirements for proving the bidders’ qualification and the criteria for selecting the most cost-effective bid.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
Requirements provided for by EU law especially focus on technical specifications.
All bidders must have equal access to them and they are to restrict competition as little as possible.
As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral.
Any details as to specific products or manufacturers as part of the technical specifications are therefore admissible only within narrow limits.
To avoid the inclusion in the tender documents of requirements that restrict competition is an elementary principle of corruption prevention.
Furthermore, it is necessary to avoid ambiguities or inaccurate information when preparing the tender documents, since such deficiencies provide a scope for speculations in connection with the preparation of bids and for manipulations in the evaluation of bids.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions about technical specifications into their national law.
As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral without requiring any particular brands.
As a matter of principle, the specifications must outline the supplies and services required, detailing the number of units of work or supplies.
In this normal case, prices are to be stipulated by units of work or supplies (e.g. euro/m² or euro/item).
Only in exceptional cases is it admissible to define the work to be done in terms of functional objectives.
As a rule the specifications need to be complete and unambiguous.
They have to include precise quantities and may not comprise work or supplies whose necessity is uncertain.
Remuneration in lump sum form or input of working time should be avoided whenever possible.
These provisions are to preclude speculations and manipulations based on ambiguous specifications in the tender documents.
The specifications must enable each bidder to prepare his bid safely and without extensive preliminary work.
The invitation to tender is to be announced only after completion of the tender documents.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to invite construction tenderers for lots.
The contracting authority is entitled to subdivide a public contract into several separate lots, if it is admitted by the nature of the subject-matter of such public contract.
In Germany, there is a requirement in principle to divide construction projects into lots, either divided by quantities (partial lots) and/or specialties (specialised lots).
This is to enable small and medium-sized contractors to compete, to increase the number of potential bidders and to make price-fixing more difficult.
This type of award is considered as usually providing best value for money.
In the Czech Republic, all tender documents, both for national and EU-wide awards, must include the evaluation criteria.
This is to inform the bidder completely and exhaustively about the criteria according to which his tender is to be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement to indicate evaluation criteria in the EU-wide contract notice or, failing that, in the tender documents applies only to EU-wide invitations to tender.
In national contract award procedures, the evaluation criteria need only be included in the contract award memo, which is an internal administrative document.
Where the tender documents are prepared by commissioned independent professionals, the German regulations require any information to be omitted from the tender documents that may help to identify the (firms of) architects or civil engineers involved.
This is to prevent individual contractors from obtaining any additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contacts with these independent professionals without the contracting authority being aware of this.
This is also the reason why independent professionals may neither post tender documents nor make planning documents available for inspection.
The contracting authority is the sole contact of the contractors.
At present, no similar provision is in force in the Czech Republic.
In case of big construction projects, the necessity of extra or modified works almost always occurs after conclusion of the original contract.
Legislation in both countries enables to award the extra works contract up to a certain threshold to the same supplier without having to conduct an award procedure and to publish a contract notice.
The volume of extra works as per both European and German legislation must not exceed 50% of original contract price.
In addition, extra works need to be indispensable and identifiable as extra components to the major contract.
In the Czech Republic, stricter limit of 20% applies to such award procedure without publishing a contract notice.
However, this may bring higher risks of time delays of project realization and eventual involvement of a new constructor in the project just underway.
If the extra works contract is also awarded to the supplier already contracted, German law stipulates the rules not enabling contractors to arbitrarily increase the prices of such modified and/or extra works.
Such calculations must be done with reference to the agreed prices of the original contract.
Apart of extra works, less works in construction may occur.
In Czech republic, less works cannot be mixed with additional extra works.
Basic audit findings
BHR
Technical specifications and productneutral invitation to tender
In individual cases, specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards that had in the meantime been replaced by EU standards.
In some cases, specifications also contained data requiring certain brands for example for graffiti resistance systems, water stops or noise abatement tiles –, although this was not needed.
In some cases specifications were so detailed that only one product could fulfil the requirements.
Bills of quantities subdivided into items
In none of the procedures audited did the German SAI detect any cases of non-compliance with the general requirement to invite tenders for supplies and services according to bills of quantities subdivided into items.
Comprehensiveness of specifications
In most of the cases reviewed, the tender documents had been fully elaborated before the process of soliciting bids was launched.
However in various cases, documents had to be modified during the tendering process to pay due regard to changing items or time schedules.
In isolated cases, tender documents contained work or supplies whose necessity was uncertain.
One tender document on demolition work we looked at consisted almost exclusively of such items.
Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded
In a large number of cases, the required justification for not subdividing the lots of services into partial lots was not given.
The criteria we studied according to which the contract is to be awarded gave us no reason to point out shortcomings.
Inclusion of names of self-employed professionals
In a number of documents the commissioned independent professionals involved were mentioned.
The names were identified on the cover sheets or on the plans or opinions attached.
In one case, the contracting authority even called upon bidders to contact the architect explicitly mentioned regarding questions on the tender.
In building construction projects such cases were caused in the first place by the self-employed persons commissioned to develop the specification documents.
The building administration services stated that they did not have enough staff to control the tender documents in detail.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In case of public procurement for 12 apartments building, there was reference to concrete supplier and type of product mentioned in the specification.
Contracting authority did not admit using of other comparable types of products. and did not give reason for insisting on these concrete suppliers and products.
In connections with the constructing of various university facilities, the tender documents specified concrete suppliers and products.
Overall list of specifications with partial specifications
In case of constructions of some industrial zones contracting authority did not clearly specify the volume and type of requested works and supplies in the list of measurement, and as measuring unit he specified for each building only the built up volume in cubic meters.
Comprehensiveness of specifications
During the procurement of public contract for construction of a road circle, the tender documentation for restricted procedure was four times changed in the period of August– September 2009.
The reason was increasing of scope of delivery and changes of technical conditions.
In case of some social buildings construction the tender documentation showed mistakes which resulted in necessity of extra works (precise location missing, technical and constructional research insufficient, drawings missing).
Tender documentation for construction of a big library described the elements of interior only without specifying product quality requirements.
As a result, some sub suppliers provided some very expensive and above standard equipment.
Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded
In the Czech Republic, no obligation of dividing public works projects into partial lots or awarding partial contracts is in place.
Analysis of three big parts of a road circle construction proved that within their public procurement in parts (individually by selected installations), savings amounting up to 31.6 million EUR could have been achieved, out of total of achieved public contract prices amounting to 620.3 million EUR.
For example, in case of offer price for 6 individual construction objects as 6 separate parts of one public contract, the savings of 2.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.
If the construction works of 20 bridges had been awarded as a separate part of one public contract, the savings amounting to 11.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.
In case of road constructions, contracting authority imposed very extensive requirements for references as suitability criteria.
In tender documentation of open procedure for one part of a motorway construction, contracting authority requested, among others, such experience of a supplier, proving his realization of at least three road construction projects worth 28 million EUR each, finalized or put into operation within the last 5 years.
In the Czech Republic, there are not more than 9 suppliers complying with the above prerequisite.
Open public procurement for another part of a motorway construction included 6 separate construction works, where the contracting authority demanded minimum yearly construction volume of construction works worth € 480 million within the last 3 years.
Podle provedeného rozboru získalo dvě třetiny finančního objemu zakázek v oblasti pozemních komunikací (62,5 mld. Kč z 92,5 mld. Kč) v letech 2008 až 2009 pět firem buď samostatně, nebo v rámci sdružení.
In case of together 46 contract award procedures worth € 528 million, there were just two or even one only tenderer.
NKÚ pointed out that restriction of the market potentional may result in major cost increases.
Area of extra works
In case of a road circle construction, contracting authority did not conclude written contract for delivery of extra works (in two cases) and he did not contracted those extra works according to any of procedures prescribed by law.
Value of extra works amounted in the first case up to € 6.7 million without VAT (increase by 21%), in second case up to € 165.4 million without VAT (increase by 91%).
The reason was an unclear determination of quantity a quality features of works.
In case of various University facilities the contracting authority did not comprise some works and deliveries into the tender documentation even if their need and necessity for construction completion and for final inspection were known just when the contract had been awarded. These works and deliveries were done on basis of addendums to the contract between contracting authority and supplier in negotiation procedure without publication.
The volume of extra works overpassed the national limit 20% of the original contract.
In connection with the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award contracts for additional work without invitation to tender.
During construction, the contracting authority increased the contract volume by € 2 million.
The unit prices for the additional work commissioned without competition were considirably higher than comparable work done by the same contractor.
Other findings
Based on selected sample of constructions, NKÚ found out that the average costs of construction of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic amounts up to € 14.6 million.
According to the long term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction of Germany, the average costs of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in Germany amount up to € 10.4 million.
This comparison suggests, that construction of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly compared to Germany.
Summarised findings
The basic legal provisions about tender documents are largely identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of EU law.
Their purpose is both to ensure comprehensive and fair competition and to prevent corruption.
The specifications must be sufficiently precise to enable bidders to accurately calculate the costs and prepare their tenders.
Moreover, this requirement is to limit the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is to be protected against the need to make contracts for extra work later.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions about tender documents are supplemented by additional regulations that are to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for effecting manipulations.
While no similarly detailed requirements of this kind exist in the Czech Republic, higher transparency is achieved there by the publication of the evaluation criteria.
The requirements for specifications have largely been complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations that may have resulted in restrictions of competition.
The rule in force in Germany that requires the segmentation of large work projects into lots promotes competition and cost-effective results.
The NKÚ has found that, in the Czech Republic, the award of large works contracts without segmentation into lots or segmentation into very large lots may restrict the circle of bidders to a small number of large enterprises.
As a result of the very extensive requirements for reference imposed in the Czech Republic for selecting bidders for road works, public contracts are awarded to only a small circle of bidders and small and medium-sized enterprises are not given the chance to compete.
A limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price-fixing and other forms of collusion.
Concerning the award of contracts for extra or modified works and the remuneration for such work, the regulatory approaches differ between the two countries.
According to both European and German legislation, extra works not exceeding 50% of the original contract price can be awarded without tendering procedure and contract notice.
In the Czech Republic stricter limit of 20% applies.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often overstepped by contracting authorities.
The reason is an insufficient definition of public works.
If the limit of 20% is exceeded, the extra works must be awarded on the basis of a tendering procedure with contract notice.
By dividing work into lots, restrictions of competition and the resulting detrimental consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and taking regard to the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority defines the number of potential contractors participating in the competition.
The contracting authority may leave the number of potential contractors and bidders largely unrestricted or may restrict the number by opting for a restricted procedure.
In the case of work projects whose value reaches or exceeds a threshold set by the EU, EU-wide tendering procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
When determining the type of award, the contracting authority especially has to comply with the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction work to be performed reaches or exceeds the current EU threshold of €5 million, it is always required that the contract be awarded EU-wide by open or restricted procedure.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedure or competitive dialogue is admissible.
Where construction projects reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a restricted extent from the principle of EU-wide contract awarding and may award contracts by national procedure, if the estimated contract value of the lot concerned is below € 1 million and the total value of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value.
It is not allowed to inappropriately divide a project by its nature single construction project without compelling reasons or deliberately estimate its cost too low in order to avoid the obligation in principle to carry out a EU-wide procedure for awarding the works contract.
Since restrictions of competition substantially increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of major importance for purposes of corruption prevention.
The detailed justification of the choice of type of award and the considerations made about the obligation to apply EU procurement law are important parts of the documentation of the contract-award procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have completely implemented in national law the EU legal requirements for contract award procedures and thresholds.
Differing provisions
The Czech Republic has made arrangements to apply the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures laid down in the directive to its national awards of work contracts.
Open and restricted procedures may always be freely chosen without the need to document or justify the decision. Other types of procedure are only permitted where certain legally defined conditions are met.
Differing from that arrangement, the relevant German provisions of budgetary law and of the guidelines for preventing corruption as a rule give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender.
Other types of procedure – including even restricted procedure or restricted tendering – are permitted only in exceptional cases, which are exhaustively determined by procurement law.
Such an exceptional case must be plausibly justified and documented.
The principle of preference for open procedure or public invitation to tender is to guarantee competition that is as little restricted as possible and to prevent opportunities for manipulation and for price-fixing among bidders by deciding in advance to choose certain tenderers.
In Germany, the principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention.
The correct estimation of expected prices of a public contract is an essential basis for deciding the adequate type of public contract award procedure.
When estimating the costs of public building construction projects, the construction administrations in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.
These databases have been compiled through analyses of completed construction projects. These databases include, among other information, standard cost figures for types of buildings, building units, building components or individual building work.
Based on such standard cost figures, it is eventually possible to estimate the contract value of a planned project or building work to be commissioned.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have similar databases for road construction.
However, it is intended to implement such databases nationwide.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable construction projects for determining the expected costs of a public contract for building constructions.
In most cases, cost determinations are based on estimates of the entity that funds the project or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction administration entity in question.
The measures for standardizing are in initial stage only.
On the basis of the programme of corruption fighting for the period of 2011–2012, the respective ministries work out the data base of customary prices of standardized commodities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The data base should serve as set of information about construction and assembling works, materials and products, and other data to enable the calculation of necessary costs and determination of unit prices.
Ministry of Transport issued price data base for transport constructions as means of price controlling, which are currently updated.
The database is intended to determine the price in project (investment) plan, and they should play comparative function within further phases of construction preparatory works.
Key audit findings BRH
Choice of tendering procedure
The contracting authorities audited largely invited tenders under open procedure or public invitation to tender, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement law.
In 2011, 59.5% of the aggregate contract volume of federal construction projects in the field of building construction was accounted for by public tendering.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
In some case where non-public tendering was chosen, we found that the reasons for the contracting authorities’ infringement of the principle of open procedure or public invitation to tender were not stated in detail.
In the course of a horizontal audit, the BRH found, on the basis of information compiled about more than 16,000 contract award procedures, that the restricted procedures have a clear disadvantage, where competition is concerned, in comparison to public procedures and public invitations to tender and that they also increase the risks of manipulation and corruption.
Public tenders in the field of building construction elicited more than twice as many bids as restricted tenders and nearly three times as many bids as awards under negotiated procedure.
Our study also revealed that the bid prices quoted in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures were 6% and 10% higher respectively than those quoted in public procedures.
Parallel studies of the Federal Building Ministry and of a Land court of audit confirmed the differences in value for money obtained by public and by restricted procedures.
The Federal Building Ministry’s performance study even revealed that the prices quoted in restricted procedures were twice as high as those quoted in public procedures.
Taking regard to the EU threshold
In respect of those work projects whose aggregate contract value was estimated at more than € 5 million, the construction authorities audited usually made contract awarding plans in which they specified which works were to be awarded by EU-wide tender and which by national tender.
According to the contract awarding plans, the share of those works that required Europe-wide tendering always exceeded 80% of the total works.
There was no evidence of circumvention of the requirement to invite tenders Europe-wide by excessively low cost estimates.
However,in some cases, as a result of errors in the calculation of total contract value, the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.
During the execution of work, some construction authorities illicitly changed the determinations made in the contract awarding plan.
They did not give any reasons for these changes and did not prove that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering continued to be complied with.
The share of EU-wide tendering according to the accounts for the projects was usually lower than laid down in the contract awarding plan.
Where the expected contract values of construction projects exceeded the EU threshold, the construction authorities did not apply EU-wide tendering to all individual lots worth more than €1 million.
Instead, they awarded the respective contracts under national procedures without giving sound reasons for the necessity of deviating from the requirement.
NKÚ
Choice of tendering procedure
In the case of several large-scale building projects, e.g. the construction of some motorway sections, of facilities for a big sports event and of housing projects, the contracting authorities split one project into several parts, although these partial contracts were of the same or similar character.
Splitting resulted in decrease of expected value under the fixed limit, and the contracts were thereafter awarded in less strict under limit procedure, or even out of law regime.
Methods for calculating the estimated contract value
Price databases set up for transport infrastructure works did not appear as sufficient tool for estimating contract volumes with some degree of accuracy.
They originated from just realized public procurements, which comprised eventual lacks of economy, construction over-works or excessive profit of suppliers.
The actual prices for three sections of the road circle were about 37% below the determined price from the database.
Ministry of transport updated the databases in a way to reflect not only the bid prices of the past years, but even comparison with comparable markets and index numbers of price progress in the area of construction.
As far as the building construction concerns, the estimative price was based on budget of project architects or estimation of investors.
The true price than varies considerably.
Assumed price of a big library reconstruction was doubled compared to the contract price, however, based on eight addendums, in process of realization the final price increased by € 2.1 million, i.e. by 27%.
Similarly, when constructing a library despository, the true price was by 33% lower compared to assumed price and prices increased during realization.
In other cases, the price of successful bidder is higher compared to assumed price and moreover, during realization it still increases.
In case of a big library construction the assumed price increased by € 16 million, i.e. by 22%, and in case of construction of a justice palace, the volume of financial needs increased during the works disproportionately (by 139%) compared to increase of function surfaces (12%).
Summarised findings
Since both countries have implemented in national law the EU provisions about the choice of type of awarding procedure and about taking regard to the EU threshold, the respective national provisions are largely identical.
However, the principle of public procedure or public tendering applicable in Germany is stricter than the EU provisions and the national provisions in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the restricted contract-award procedures, public procedure or public tendering gives more businesses the opportunity to participate in competition.
These types of contract award procedure generate a large number of bids and the best results in terms of value of money.
Corruption prevention is enhanced considerably, since the circle of candidates is not restricted by decisions taken beforehand by the contracting authority which leave room for manipulation and for price fixing among bidders.
The studies have confirmed the advantage obtained through the German rule that preference must be given to public procedure or public invitation to tender.
Czech legal rules enable the contracting authorities to award a contract in open or restricted procedure.
However, the latest amendment of procurement law has introduced a general prohibition to limit the number of bidders in procedures that involve a prior competition for participation.
The restricted procedure has now become very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirement to give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender, whereas in the Czech Republic some projects have been divided, which is not allowed, in order to circumvent the requirements governing the choice of the type of awarding procedure.
However, in Germany in some cases the EU threshold has not been taken regard to, ensuing that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.
In the Czech Republic, no satisfactory solution facilitating the correct calculation of expected costs of construction works and construction projects does yet exist.
The construction authorities should ensure, if applicable, by means of more extensive controls that the requirements governing the choice of type of awarding procedure and the volume of contracts to be awarded EU-wide are complied with or should create the conditions necessary to be able to calculate costs accurately.
Prior information and contract notice
Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authority is to publish a contract notice for interested businesses outlining the contracts to be awarded.
Prior information and contract notices are an important basis for EUwide
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The prior information notice has to include the essential specifications of the intended work project.
These notices are required in the case of work projects whose estimated total contract value is equal to or higher than the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadlines for submitting tenders in open or restricted procedures.
The contracting authority has to publish a contract notice with detailed information on any public works contract that requires EU-wide tendering.
Once published, this information is binding on the contracting authority.
Among other information, the contract notice has to include the specifications, the deadlines for the procedure and the performance of the contract, the special requirements, the award criteria and their weighting.
The EU-wide common procurement vocabulary (CPV) must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
The prior information and contract notices are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the contracting authority.
To prevent any discrimination of foreign interested parties, notices published at national level may not contain any additional information and may not be published before the text of the notice has been posted to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the contract notice may impair competition and perhaps even facilitate manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented the EU provisions on prior information and contract notices in national law.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, prior information and notices must also be published for the works contracts for which EU-wide tendering is not required.
Contract award procedures may not start earlier than one month after the publication of prior information in the EU’s Official Journal (in case of EU-wide award procedures) and in the national official gazette (in case of all award procedure).
The publication of prior information can only be omitted in exceptional cases.
In Germany, the publication of prior information is not needed in cases where no EU-wide tendering is required.
In case of national tendering procedures public invitations to tender and competitions for participation preliminary to restricted invitations to tender must be publicly announced on the Federal Government’s website and, where appropriate, in newspapers orjournals.
In case of restricted invitations to tender without competition for participation, notices have to be published where the estimated contract value amounts to or exceeds € 25,000 (ex ante transparency).
Preliminary information notices must set forth all planned lots of the work projects.
Given the small volumes of works contracts awarded in Germany, this is an important requirement.
As the number of work projects divided into lots for purposes of tendering is much smaller in the Czech Republic, this provision is much less important there.
Key audit findings
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities audited published prior information for all public works projects that involved work to be contracted out by EU-wide tender.
However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the deadlines for tendering at a time when the required minimum period of 52 days between sending preliminary information and sending the publications had not yet expired.
In the case of other shortened procedures, tenders were invited only when the twelve-month validity period of the preliminary information had already expired and had not yet been extended.
Many publications of preliminary information did not include advice to the effect that the total volume of work would be divided into lots.
Contract notice
Some of the contract notices issued by the audited bodies included CPV codes which deviated from the contents of preliminary information notices or did not accurately specify the work to be done.
In isolated cases, the contract notices published at national level included more information – e.g. concerning performance deadlines – or were published earlier than the notices published in the European Union’s Official Journal.
Ex-ante transparency
The units of one construction administration had commissioned a service company with publishing the national notices.
The latter published the notices on its own procurement platform for the use of which fees are charged.
The construction authorities had however not checked whether this company had complied with the requirement to pass on the notices to the Federal Government’s free internet portal.
Sample audits showed that only one third of the notices had been published on the latter portal.
NKÚ
Contract notice
In case of the construction of a water treatment plant, the contracting authority in its publication of award procedure to suppliers did not indicate the criteria it intended to apply in selecting tenderers.
The contracting authority was not able to prove the way of bid selection.
Reduction of number of bidders was, according to previous legislation, duly in place.
In case of a road circle construction the contracting authority did not specify the figures for evaluation of compliance with qualification criteria and did not indicate the number of bidders to be invited nor in publication of restricted procedure opening neither in the contract award documentation.
The contracting authority evaluated the qualification requirements of all 6 bidders in the restricted procedure as being complied with, but one bidder was excluded because he met the qualification requirements on the last sixth position.
These steps of contracting authority were not transparent, because no information concerning the qualification particulars evaluation and the method of evaluation had ever been published.
Publication of notices
In case of ex-military areas reconstructions, the contracting authority did not publish the written invitation to tender.
Conclusions and recommendations / summarised findings
The two-stage information procedure with prior information and contract notice is an important instrument for implementing the transparency requirement that applies to EU-wide tendering procedures and thus for enhancing competition and preventing corruption.
By extending the obligation to publish prior information to national tendering procedures in the Czech Republic and by applying this obligation in Germany in cases of open and restricted tendering, both countries have implemented EU requirements and thus increased the transparency of national tendering procedures.
Selection of candidates in case of restricted tendering procedures
In contrast to public tendering procedures, restricted tendering procedures do not permit all potential contractors who are interested in winning the contract to participate in the competition.
Under restricted procedures, the contracting authority must previously select potential contractors that will be asked to submit a tender.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The EU provisions permit a limitation of the number of candidates in EU-wide restricted tendering procedures.
However, restricted procedure requires at least five candidates to be asked to submit tenders and in the case of negotiated procedures with previous publication of a contract notice at least three potential contractors must be invited.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently large to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective and nondiscriminatory and must be published in advance.
The selection of potential contractors to be invited is a stage within the tendering procedure which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. undue preference being given to certain contractors.
Moreover, the restriction of competition to few contractors may facilitate collusive tendering.
In both case, such practices may considerably deteriorate the result of thetendering procedure to the disadvantage of the contracting authority.
Therefore, the latter, must make special arrangements to prevent manipulations, to ensure that adequate controls are in place and that this stage in the procedure is transparent and plausible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
The provisions on the selection of candidates are similar in the two countries.
In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities are to alternate among the contractors to be invited.
It is also not permitted to restrict competition to contractors domiciled in particular regions.
The contracting authorities have to document and justify the selection of bidders and the course of the selection procedure in the contract award memos.
Differing provisions
In Germany, it is required to invite at least three candidates in the case of restricted tendering and several suitable candidates in the case of awards by negotiated contract.
Except in two specific cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of invited tenderers in case of restricted and negotiated procedure.
In Germany, it is required to observe the crosscheck principle when selecting the candidates.
If, e.g. one staff member has proposed a list of candidates, a senior manager of the construction administration or a commissioned staff member of the contracting authority must as a rule modify this proposal e.g. by deleting one of the candidates from the list and/or by adding a new candidate.
This is to prevent that a single individual can finally determine the circle of candidates participating in the competition.
In the absence of such a requirement, far-reaching collusion among the participants would be possible.
The list of candidates to be invited must be treated confidentially and not generally divulged.
This also applies to self-employed professionals.
In the Czech Republic, no similar provisions on the drawing up and confidential treatment of lists of candidates are in place.
Under the German provisions, self-employed professionals may not determine the candidates to be invited but may make proposals to the contracting authority.
Czech rules do not deal with this issue
Key audit results
BRH
Number of bidders
With few exceptions, the requirement for a minimum number of potential contractors to be asked to submit tenders in case of restricted procedures was complied with.
An analysis of nearly 7,000 tendering procedures for building construction limited to the national level showed that, in the case of Federal Government restricted procedures, the contracting authorities invited on average 6.6 potential contractors and, in the case of negotiated contracts, on average 4.4 potential contractors.
Change of contractors and regional restrictions
Especially where building trades with few contractors were involved, the contracting authorities did not make any changes in the circle of selected contractors.
Above all, contractors already known for their good performance were considered more frequently.
The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of non-public procedures, they were bound to ensure the suitability of the contractors to be asked to submit tenders even before actually asking them.
While there was no evidence for illicit restrictions to bidders located in the region, the circle of bidders in the restricted tendering procedures included a larger portion of regional bidders than was the case in public tendering procedures.
The contracting construction authorities attributed this mainly to the smaller contract volumes in comparison to those of public tenders which made long ways to the site a more significant cost item.
Cross-checking principles, proposals of self-employed professionals
The contract-awarding authorities largely disregarded the provisions on the fundamental change of the list of proposed contractors by an independent person.
They especially argued the shortage of staff resources for processing, time pressure or inadequate knowledge about alternative suitable contractors.
In many cases, the records did not indicate who had proposed the contractors to be asked to submit tenders.
The audit of some samples revealed that the lists of potential bidders had been made by self- employed professionals and had been adopted by the contracting authorities without any changes.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not adequately protect themselves against potential manipulations.
Confidential treatment of lists of potential contractors
In one contracting authority, the lists of the contractors to be asked for tenders were held on a data-processing system to which all staff of that authority had read access.
If there had been any intent to manipulate, the unauthorised divulgation of the names of the envisaged or admitted bidders would have been possible which might have enabled contractors to commit price-fixing.
Documentation
Only in few cases did the documentation of contract award procedures show reasons for the selection of bidders.
NKÚ
Selection of bidders
In case of a road circle the bidders had no information about the items of the qualification to be assesed and in which way.
In case of development and modernization of water ways and ports, notices of tender in restricted procedure did not indicate criteria of reduction of the bidders.
All eight participating bidders complied with the qualification requirements, but the limited number of bidders was thus exceeded.
Thereafter, the committee proceeded on the basis of accidental selection – by drawing, which, at that time, was a legal step.
This way of selection, however, should have been mentioned as one of criteria just in the tender notice.
Summarised findings
Given the high risk of manipulation in the selection of bidders in restricted contract award procedures, both countries have introduced special arrangements to prevent illicit restrictions of competition.
The German rules restrict such opportunities for manipulation by means of the cross-check principle, by keeping lists of bidders confidential and by restricting the authority to make proposals for the selection of bidders to the contracting authorities.
Under the new Czech rules potential manipulative restrictions tend to be prevented mainly by the requirement that the number of bidders in restricted procedures must be unlimited.
However, the audit evidence generated revealed that part of these rules was poorly implemented and that the potential for an abusive restriction of the circle of bidders was not adequately reduced in these cases.
The contract-awarding authorities should completely eliminate the deficiencies pointed out.
Tendering phase
The tendering phase, in which potential contractors may draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents which they have received, begins with the publication of the contract notice and/or with the invitation of tenders.
Potential tenderers may submit tenders until expiry of the deadline for submission, prescribed by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
EU law does not impose special requirements for this phase of the tendering procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national provisions designed to counteract the potential for manipulation that exists during the bidding phase.
Such compliance especially relates to organiational arrangements and controls.
Provision of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
As a matter of principle, the tender documents on the basis of which the potential contractors are to work out their bids must always be sent out by the contracting authority.
Private independent professionals involved in the tendering procedure may not perform this task.
The contracting authority has to make sure, that all candidates receive the same information during the tendering phase.
In case of ambiguities in the tender documents or where other questions arise, only the contracting authority may furnish information to the candidates.
The independent professionals commissioned to draw up the tender documents may not provide any information.
During the entire tendering phase, any direct contact between the commissioned independent professionals and the candidates must be prevented.
The firms are not to become a turntable of the contract awarding procedure which enables contacts to be made that adversely affect competition.
Tenders forwarded by post or directly have to be submitted in a closed envelope.
Tenders communicated electronically must be technically encoded.
Differing provisions
In Germany, the contracting authority may commission external service providers to print and send out the tender documents, whose staff must be made to pledge to keep the bids secret and to perform contractual obligations with due care.
In Germany, the tenders received must be marked with a date of receipt stamp and directly and immediately forwarded unopened to a public servant who is responsible for keeping them in custody.
This public servant must not be involved in the tendering procedure.
The tenders received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority draws up a memo with the tender data including contract numbers and information about the drawing up and receipt.
There are no detailed provisions about the custody of the tenders.
Key audit findings
BRH
BRH audits of the tendering phase focused on the contract award procedures of one building construction administration.
Posting of contract documents
The contract awarding authorities of the building construction administration audited either posted the tender documents themselves or had them printed and posted by an external service company.
Self-employed professionals did not post any tender documents.
Information furnished to bidders
In its designation of the contacts for making queries and obtaining information, the audited building construction administration largely did not comply with the rules for separating planning from the contract award procedure.
Contrary to applicable provisions, it often did not name staff of the contract awarding authority as contact in the specifications but rather staff from the project management units.
Some contract award notifications even included the names of the firms of self-employed professionals who had drawn up the tender documents.
There were isolated cases in which bidders who made inquiries during the bidding stage did not receive identical information.
Marking of tenders
In the construction administration audited, all tenders received were marked with a received stamp and a receipt note.
In the case of some negotiated procedures, however, the tenders were received by self-employed professionals, a practice which prevention rules. infringed the corruption
Úschova nabídek
Ne všechny nabídky byly poslány přímo a bez zpoždění k oficiálnímu uložení, aby byly uzamčeny v ocelové schránce.
In one construction authority, the tenders were temporarily placed in an open pigeonhole of the post room to which each staff member had access.
Another authority had placed a letter-box in a corridor not under constant surveillance and the tenders thrown into this box partly remained there over night.
Since the slot of that letter-box was large and unsecured, not only staff of the authority would have been able to retrieve and manipulate tenders received.
NKÚ
No shortcomings found out in the Czech Republic.
Summarised findings
Provisions are in place in both countries which are to prevent contacts especially between interested enterprises and independent professionals involved in the contract award procedure during the tendering stage.
Equal treatment is to be ensured by furnishing the same information to all bidders.
The rules for the reception, custody and secrecy of the tenders appear suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more comprehensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audit evidence generated in Germany has highlighted infringements of the rules in some areas.
These deficiencies could be remedied with a small input of resources.
Opening of the envelopes
Opening of envelopes
During the bid-opening session, the bids that so far have remained closed will be opened and their contents will be read out and published.
The period during which the bidder is bound by his tender begins at a moment of bidders´ submission date expiry, eventually at the moment of envelopes opening, and ends by deadline set by contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
EU law does not include any specific provisions about the opening of envelopes.
However, national laws and regulations comprise extensive requirements for the protection of the bids and of the competition during this highly sensitive phase of the contract award procedure.
The crosscheck principle and the transparency and traceability of the opening of envelopes are to prevent manipulations and modifications of the tenders submitted.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
The bid-opening session must be conducted by several persons to be designated by the contracting authority.
Compliance with the crosscheck principle is to prevent that individuals can manipulate bids without this being noticed.
In both countries, the bidders may in majority of cases attend opening session.
The envelopes when being opened, must have been lain in front of the leader of the proceedings when the first bid was opened.
Bids that have been received late may never be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening session, the actions taken and the results of bid-opening are to be recorded and the record, among other information, must contain the names of the bidders and the prices quoted.
The minutes must be read out and must be signed by the leader of the proceedings.
The bidders present may also sign the minutes.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, a committee is in charge of the opening of bids.
The participation of independent professionals is permitted.
The Committee may be tasked with conducting subsequent phases of the contract award procedure, e.g. the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, the opening of bids is conducted by a leader of proceedings and a keeper of the minutes.
The leader of proceedings must be a staff member of a contracting authority.
The leader of proceedings and – in the case of building construction – the keeper of the minutes are not to be involved in drawing up the tender documents, in awarding the contract and in contract management.
The German provisions demand that the minutes of the opening session include not only the prices quoted by bidders but also any information about discounts and rebates and extraordinary features e.g. bids received that were damaged or arrived late.
In the Czech Republic, the minutes of the opening session put on record – apart from the prices quoted by bidders – the language of the bid and the applicant’s authority to sign it.
The German provisions require that all parts of the opened bids must be marked so as to prevent any subsequent modifications and amendments.
The bids, which are usually marked by perforation with the date of the opening session, must be kept secret after the opening session and may be made accessible only to the persons commissioned with processing them.
There are no similar Czech provisions.
If only one bid is received in any contract award procedure in the Czech Republic, the bid may not be opened and is to be returned without any evaluation.
In Germany, no similar provision exists. If only one bid is received, it has to be opened and subsequently evaluated.
Basic audit findings
BRH
Cross-checking principle
During the bid-opening sessions, the contracting authorities audited complied with the crosschecking requirement.
They conducted the bidopening sessions always with a session leader and a minute writer to whom no other tenderrelated tasks had been assigned.
In isolated cases of smaller negotiated contracts, however, self-employed professionals opened tenders sent to them, without involvement of the contracting authority.
Minutes
The minutes of the bid-opening sessions did not always completely document the opening of bids.
In some cases, the bids that had been submitted late were not included and in some cases, even signatures were missing.
Marking of bids
The contracting authorities examined in the course of the horizontal audit marked the bids by perforation with the date of the bid-opening session, thereby complying with the requirements.
Audits of grant recipients conducted in the past, had revealed inadequate marking.
These contracting authorities changed their marking practice in response to the BRH’s objection.
NKÚ
Time limit for the receipt of tenders
In case of contracts awarded for road repairs, one bid was received by the contracting authority only one month after expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders. The contracting authority nevertheless admitted this bid.
Summarised findings
The rules in place in the two countries for opening the envelopes are largely identical. They take into account both the cross-check principle and the principle of transparency which permits a significant restriction of the risks of corruption and manipulation.
The German rules are more comprehensive than those of the Czech Republic.
Especially the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure, on the marking, safe custody and secrecy of the tenders substantially restrict subsequent changes of the tenders.
Moreover, the officials responsible for opening the envelopes may not perform any other functions in connection with the contracts to be awarded.
The fact that the audits revealed few contraventions proves that the rules for the opening of envelopes are largely accepted.
Examination and evaluation of tenders
The contracting authority has to examine and evaluate the tenders that have been received by the envelope-opening day.
It has to award the contract to the tender which best meets the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
EU law provides for a procedure in several stages:
The first step is to determine the suitability of the tenderers.
These must have a good economic and financial standing and the required professional and technical knowledge or ability.
Economic operators that have been convicted by final sentence for bribery or fraud must always be excluded from the tendering procedure.
The tenders of the tenderers not excluded must be evaluated in terms of arithmetical accuracy, technical feasibility and value for money and on the basis of the previously published contract award criteria.
The contracting authority has to determine the economically most favourable tender. The contracting authority has to examine especially any abnormally low prices offered.
The examination and evaluation stage of the tendering procedure is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
For instance, tenderers may be excluded without due cause or tenders that not meet the requirements may be kept in the competition.
The result of the evaluation may unduly be influenced by giving preference to a tenderer or putting him at a disadvantage, thereby preventing the determination of the economically most favourable tender.
The contracting authority therefore has to make special arrangements particularly to ensure that the persons commissioned with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and technical expertise.
It also has to make sure that the tendering procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and plausible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries call for the examination and evaluation of tenders by successive stages.
The requirements for the proofs of suitability to be submitted by the enterprises, the evaluation criteria for deciding about the award and the weighting of these criteria have been laid down in the contract notices or the tender documents and may not be changed during the tendering procedure.
After checking the suitability of tenderers, the suitability criteria may no longer be applied in the evaluation of the tenders.
Such evaluation has to be made only on the basis of the contract award criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be examined under formal criteria as to whether they are complete and whether they include conspicuous features that suggest an intention to manipulate.
Where tenderers are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they have to be notified of this without delay.
If the evaluation of tenders results in a price that appears inappropriately low, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment on this prior to the potential exclusion of his tender.
The reasons for the decisions taken in the process must be documented transparently.
Differing provisions
In Germany, the tenders must be kept secret and only the persons commissioned to process them may have the right of access.
Only the contracting authority may review the tenders and verify their arithmetical accuracy.
This work may be assigned only to staff not involved in the contract award decision or the implementation of the project.
There are no precise regulations as to who may perform the further examination and evaluation tasks.
Where self-employed persons are commissioned to examine and evaluate the tenders, they have to honour the confidentiality of these tenders.
They only may make decision proposals to the contracting authority.
In the Czech Republic awarding committees are set up for checking and evaluating the tenders.
The committees produce an evaluation report with proposals for the contract award.
However, in both countries the ultimate decisions about contract awards are made only by the contracting authorities.
If, in Germany, proofs or declarations required to be presented in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the contracting authority must give bidders the chance to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents have not yet been received after expiry of this deadline, the bid must be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may at its own discretion decide whether or not to give bidders the opportunity to supplement missing proofs or declarations.
Unless the bidder presents them he must be excluded.
In Germany, not only the total price of tenders has to be examined but also the unit prices (prices of work segments).
If the price structure of the tender suggests that prices for parts of the work to be done have been estimated excessively low or high, the tenderer must be asked to clarify these issues.
If he does not succeed in doing so and if the contracting authority can prove compensatory pricing, the tender in question must be excluded.
This is to prevent that tenderers calculate their tenders on the basis of the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made for certain parts of the work performed, which may lead to significant increases in the cost of work projects.
In the Czech Republic, the overall price is evaluated but not the appropriateness of prices for parts of the work.
Compensatory pricing is no justification for the exclusion of a tender.
In Germany, no contract may be awarded to tenders whose price is inappropriately high or low.
Where one or few tenders differ by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from the other tenders, the tenderers must prove that their tenders have been soundly calculated.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude these tenders.
Once value for money has been examined, tenders in the Czech Republic may be cancelled if only tenders with an excessively low price that cannot be justified have been received.
Where prices of tenders are substantially higher than the one estimated by the contracting authority, this is not a valid reason for refusing to award the contract to that tender (contrary to German procurement law).
If, in Germany, there is a suspicion of behaviour restricting competition, the contracting authority must immediately report to the authority in charge of its technical oversight.
The latter has to decide about the action to be taken and whether it is appropriate to inform the cartel authority (antitrust authority) or the public prosecution service.
The oversight authority has to approve e.g. also where the works contract is worth more than € 50.000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest-priced tender, where the award is to be made by negotiated contract or where the tendering procedure is to be cancelled.
Czech rules do not deal with this issue.
Key audit findings
BRH
Examination of suitability and award criteria
Most contract award procedures examined complied with the requirements set.
In the case of some potential contractors recommended by self-employed professionals, the contract awarding authorities did not check the suitability of these companies themselves.
One grant recipient commissioned contractors although the required proofs of suitability were not completely at hand.
In the case of some tendering procedures, there was no sound evidence as to whether the contract awarding authority’s choice had taken into account all published award criteria or whether its contract award decision had been based only on the criterion of price.
Selection of persons involved and secrecy of the tenders
Some of the contracting authorities used the services of unauthorised persons.
For instance, self-employed professionals or staff of the construction offices that were involved in the planning or implementation of a work project performed functions whose discharge was incumbent exclusively on the contract awarding authority.
The construction authorities sought to justify this by inadequate staff resources in the sectors concerned.
In some cases, the self-employed professionals commissioned to examine the tenders used staff that had not been formally obliged to keep the tenders secret and to exercise due care in the fulfilment of their contractual commitments.
Concerning the construction authorities, there usually was no conclusive evidence as to whether the tenders, when in the custody of the self-employed professionals, were accessible only for the persons to which their processing was directly assigned.
Review and arithmetical check of the tenders
Some contracting authorities handed over the opened tenders to self-employed professionals for further examination without having first performed the prescribed review of tenders and arithmetical check and documented the results of these examinations.
In case of any intention to manipulate, third parties could have made changes in the tenders which the contracting authorities would not have been able to identify.
The documents examined revealed a number of cases in which unusual features were not adequately marked or where information about prices and products was missing.
Performance audits
A sample audit in a construction authority revealed that, in 75% of all contract award procedures, the most favourable tenders deviated by more than 10% from the estimates made beforehand.
One in twenty contract award procedures was cancelled owing to inappropriate tender prices.
In a number of cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation about examinations of tenders or discussions with tenderers held to clarify questions.
In many cases, detailed information was missing, e.g. concerning unit prices of the most important items in the invoices.
Factors such as changed market prices or increases of material costs were frequently given as reasons for the deviations.
The construction authorities stated that identifying and proving compensatory pricing was difficult.
In the case of one invitation to tender issued by a non-departmental body, the lowest price quoted in a tender was 66% lower than the previous estimate of the contract value.
Closer examinations of costing or investigations to identify the causes of this deviation were not on record.
In a discussion to clarify the question, the contract awarding authority did not find any evidence as to price dumping by the tenderer to whom the contract was eventually awarded.
Thus, it remained unclear whether the previous estimate was excessive or the tender price was too low.
Later, the contract awarding authority classified the contractor as “low-cost company” which was neither able to meet the quality requirements nor the deadlines.
In another tendering procedure, the construction authority adjudicated the contract to a tender whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimate.
It did not cancel the tendering procedure, adducing the unfounded argument that the company in question could be expected not to base its pricing on unreasonably high costs.
Suspicion of irregularities
Two cases of irregularities were found in one audited construction authority and reported to the authority responsible for technical supervision.
In one tendering procedure, two bidders submitted identical cost calculations which prompted the construction authority to exclude both tenders.
The audits did not reveal any significant deficiencies in the application of the other provisions.
NKÚ
Verification of the suitability
In many of the construction projects audited such as university buildings, road and railway construction, and others, the contracting authorities did not exclude the bidders from participation in the procedure, even if they did not comply with the requirements of tender documentation or they did not prove their qualification in the extent prescribed. On the other hand, one contracting authority could neither prove nor explain the reason of excluding a bidder who complied with the requirements.
Evaluation
When awarding a contract for the construction of a water treatment plant the contracting authority did not base its examination and evaluation on the defined evaluation criteria.
In case of rail road construction, the contracting authority determined the weight of evaluation criteria as late as in the beginning of evaluation.
In case of road repairs, the defined criterion of “construction period shortening” was evaluated inappropriately.
As a result, the shortening offered by the bidders that were second and third in the competition was not adequately taken into account.
Documentation of the reasons why a bidder was selected
In three contract award procedures for the support of housing, the contracting authority did not document what criteria were used in the course of evaluation and what was the way of selection of successful bidder.
When awarding small scale contracts worth up to €20 000 in connection with a motorway construction, the contracting authority selected the bidders only on the basis of telephone consultations concerning the prices and terms of deliveries.
It was impossible to audit these selections, because these consultations were not documented.
Summarised findings
In both countries, the rules for examining and evaluating the tenders comply with EU requirements.
However, they differ with respect to detailed steps of the procedure and the selection of the individuals involved.
In Germany, the steps of the procedure are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially concerning the implementation of the cross-check principle and the protection of bids than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices quoted.
In both countries it was found that in some of the cases audited essential steps of the procedure for examining and evaluating the tenders were not documented at all or, if they were, only incompletely.
However, the lack of an audit trail and of transparency in respect of the decisions taken during examination and evaluation facilitates manipulations.
A particularly grave deficiency was the handing over of tenders to third parties without prior appropriate examination and documentation of the tenders by the contract-awarding authority which would have prevented any manipulations.
Where contract-awarding authorities commission third parties to perform functions in connection with the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate arrangements and enhanced control are necessary to counteract the increased risk of manipulation.
When auditing the appropriateness of prices, the audited administrative entities in Germany did not always make use of the complete range of tools available and thus inadequately explored the price structure.
In the Czech Republic, the audit revealed irregularities especially in connection with the examination of suitability and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the tendering procedure
Once the tenders have been examined and evaluated, the tendering procedure is completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be notified in advance of the contract award decision taken.
The contractors have the opportunity to examine the intended decision within a period of 10 or 15 days and to seek a review where appropriate.
No contract may be concluded before expiry of this period.
If forwarded electronically or per fax, the limitation period is 10 days. If other means of communication are used, it is 15 days.
If a bidder applies for review within the notification period, a contract may be concluded only after the final decision taken in the review procedure.
Moreover, the enterprises may refer the award decision made under this procedure to an independent court of law for further review.
The review is to ensure both legal protection given to the contractors and compliance with procurement law by the contracting authority.
The contracting authority must adequately document the tendering procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the information and review procedure.
In both countries, the decision about awarding the contract lies with the contracting authority.
The latter may however not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a duly conducted examination and evaluation.
The contracting authority is to award the contract within the announced examination period.
The reason is the fact that the bidders are no longer bound by their tenders once this period has expired.
In open and restricted procedures and public or restricted invitations to tender, the contracting authority may not stipulate a content of the contract which deviates from that of the tender.
The unsuccessful bidders are to be notified on a timely basis of the award decision made and the reasons why their respective bids have not been accepted.
The cancellation of tendering procedures is admissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices quoted in the tenders are excessivesind or the tenders do not conform to the specifications.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15 days obligatory information and waiting period before awarding the contract also applies to work contracts that do not require Europe-wide tendering.
In Germany, the equivalent provision only applies to EU-wide tendering procedures.
In all other tendering procedures in Germany, the tenderers my not be informed about the contract award until the award decision has been taken.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be cancelled, if only one tender has been received or only one tender met the requirements for being considered and evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded, if only one single tender has been received, provided that this tender meets the conditions set forth in the tender documents and is cost-effective.
Key audit findings
BRH
Only few deficiencies in the completion of the tendering procedures audited were found.
In some cases of EU-wide tendering, companies received commissioning letters before expiry of the notification period, which may render the contract void.
Also, in some cases of open procedures, commissioning letters included modifications incompatible with the contents of the tender, e.g. new deadlines.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the deadlines for awarding the contracts.
In case of an open procedure, the contracting authority commissioned the second most favourable bidder, because a bidder whose tender price was more than 50 % lower was no longer willing to perform the contract at the price originally quoted.
NKÚ
In case of a construction project in the field of higher education, the contracting authority did not conclude the contract with the bidder in correspondence to the contract proposal indicated in the bid of selected supplier.
In some contract award cases, such as repair and maintenance of the roads, construction of a motorway and of road circle, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts later than prescribed by law.
In case of contracts awarded in the context of exmilitary areas reconstructions, contracting authority dispatched the information of selected bid to all bidders only after expiration of legal deadline.
Summarised findings
Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the completion of tendering procedures.
The legal protection of unsuccessful bidders contributes to reducing corruption.
Within Czech procurement law, the purview of legal protection also encompasses awards falling below EU thresholds.
In both countries, it was found that the limitation period for awarding contracts had been exceeded.
This may result in adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In future, the construction authorities should eliminate such shortcomings in completing tender procedures.
Documentation, notification and reporting duties
During the successive steps of the contractaward procedures, relevant findings and decisions and their underlying reasons must be documented in a transparent way.
In case of EUwide procedure, contract awards are to be publicly announced.
The data on the contract awards are also included in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The obligation to document contract-award procedures complies with a basic requirement of the transparency principle that applies EU-wide.
Only a careful and timely documentation ensures transparency as to the contract-award decisions and the reasons underlying them. In particular, it ensures the effective legal protection of bidders’ interests in cases where the contract value exceeds the EU thresholds.
Due documentation is also an essential ingredient to corruption prevention since the obligation to give detailed justifications for contract-award decisions significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
In the case of EU-wide contract-award procedures, the contracting authorities have to notify all awards made under EU-wide contractaward procedures to the EU’s Office of Official Publications not later than 48 days after the contract award date.
The Office publishes the notifications in the EU’s Official Journal and thus also honours the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must collect the essential data on their contract-award procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual statistics which enable it to obtain an overview of the development of the Single Market in the field of construction works.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have completely transposed into national law the provisions of EU law concerning documentation and notification.
The provisions on documentation and notification for the purpose of EU statistics are largely identical in both countries.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, the duty to publish contract awards does not only apply to EU-wide procurements but also to national contract-award procedures.
The deadline for notification is only 15 days.
In Germany, public announcement duties apart from those imposed by EU law apply only to restricted tendering exceeding a threshold of €25,000 and discretionary awarding of contracts (negotiated contracts) exceeding a threshold of €15,000 VAT excluded (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these thresholds and in the case of public tenders, only the participating enterprises are given information about the contract awards.
Basic audit findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the tendering procedures audited were not documented completly.
The contract award notices did not include all necessary information about e.g. reasons for product specifications and national regulations.
In the case of one tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not give any reason why it had awarded the contract to a bidder whose tender did not include obligatory proofs.
In a few cases, documentation of the contracting authorities did not include all records required for documenting the tendering procedure.
Publication of contract awards
In the case of some EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publish the contract award notices.
In the case of several tendering procedures, the proofs for the publication of contract award notices by the contracting authorities were missing.
Reporting duties
The statistical compilations reviewed included the required minimum information and had been produced and posted on a timely basis.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the construction administrations audited published the contract data of the completed tendering procedure.
In the case of one construction administration, however, these data were not published due to a communication error.
It took the construction administration half a year to notice the mistake.
As a result, contract data of the tendering procedures completed during that period were not published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In case of construction work connected with a large sports event considerable shortcomings in documentation in course of procurement procedure were found out, which concerned mainly incorrect data e.g. in evaluation committee records concerning the bid prices.
In adition, some of the minutes about the opening of envelopes were not signed.
Publication of contract awards
In case of repairs and maintenance of road construction projects, announcements of contracts awarded were distributed after the deadline, resp. they were not published.
Summarised findings
The provisions on documentation, reporting and notification implement the EU requirements and are largely identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of contract-award procedures and award decisions.
The Czech publication requirements are somewhat stricter than their German counterparts.
The examination revealed shortcomings substantially reducing the value of documentation and publication as a means of corruption prevention.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The construction authorities should further enhance the transparency of their contract award procedures and should fully meet reporting and notification requirements.
Summarised evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKU and the BRH focused on two issues which are essential both in the Czech Republic and in Germany for the awarding of public works contracts: the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.
The provisions of EU law provide the opportunity for international competition within the EU in order to create a European Single Market.
Measures designed to prevent corruption do not only aim at avoiding or at least reducing corruption. They are also to prevent financial damage and potential loss of confidence in the integrity of government.
The audit findings generated by the two SAIs with respect to the application of procurement law in both countries and the comparison of the respective provisions of procurement law provide an insight into the common and differing features that may be helpful for both countries in further developing their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU legislation concerning the awarding of public works contracts.
Thus, an important common basis exists in both countries for the awarding of public works contracts and the compliance with the essential requirements in this field: competition; equal treatment of the participating enterprises and transparency of the contract award procedure.
The construction administrations of both countries have underpinned these requirements by partly very extensive administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely adopted the provisions on public works contracts requiring EU-wide tendering for those contract award procedures that are below the EU threshold and are therefore governed by national law.
However, the SAIs‘ audits revealed that the construction administrations did not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU-law.
The construction administration in Germany should continue to improve the quality of its contract award procedures in order to eliminate the deficiencies pointed out with respect to the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the audits furthermore identified the risks impacting on the value for money achieved in contract award procedures.
For instance, incomplete specification of the public contract subject, resulting in need of extra works, often awarded in contradiction to the law. Furthermore, insufficient specification of the expected price was provided. Also, qualification requirements limited the possible number of bidders, thus restricting competition, namely in the area of transport constructions.
Corruption prevention
Our audits did not aim at detecting cases of corruption.
One of the reasons was that the SAIs do not have the necessary tools at their disposal.
However, the SAIs can check whether the administrations of the two countries have adopted measures to curb corruption and manipulation in connection with awards of public works contracts and how these measures are applied.
In respect of corruption prevention, the two countries have focused on different aspects.
The German provisions mainly provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and checks as central elements of corruption prevention.
The Czech provisions mainly aim at increasing the transparency of the procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention are in place that apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles have also been implemented in the requirements for awarding public works contracts and have been adapted to meet the special needs of such contract awards.
The relevant provisions specify, partly with great precision, the ways in which the requirements of corruption prevention need to be met in the course of the contract award procedure and the selection of the persons involved in them.
In the BRH’s opinion, especially the principle that preference must be given to open procedures or public invitations to tender is a suitable tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in connection with the awarding of public works contracts, while restrictions of competition increase the risk of manipulation.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the cross-check principle), the requirements concerning transparency, the documentation of contract award procedures and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms to prevent corruption and manipulation.
We therefore do not perceive any need for fundamental changes of the respective provisions public entities have to comply with when awarding public works contracts.
The provisions on corruption prevention are largely implemented in practice.
The deficiencies found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in complying with some requirements.
Therefore, the construction administrations should offer further training to their staff to enhance their familiarity with the requirements for corruption prevention and further increase their awareness of this issue.
An essential part of the weaknesses highlighted referred to tasks which the construction administrations had delegated to self-employed professionals.
However, in the absence of adequate checks and controls, the delegation of tasks increases the risk of abuse.
Tasks vulnerable to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be assigned to third parties, if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against undue interference.
NKÚ
The Czech Republic adopted on governmental level the anti-corruption strategies which focus on public procurement.
Essential amendments of the Act on public contracts award and connecting implementation rules were made.
The NKÚ audits were carried out in the period of realization of this strategy.
The adopted strategy and new legal provisions may represent the efficient measures for improvement, whereas the contracting authorities have to justify effectiveness of public contracts, calculation of expected prices, adequacy of qualification requirements, definition of the basic evaluation criteria and the way of bid evaluation, and all that must be duly documented and published.
Recommendations
On the whole, the NKU and BRH have a favourable opinion about the way the EU requirements are implemented.
The fact that they are largely accepted in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for awarding public works contracts within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union may also serve as a basis for similar projects designed to facilitate and encourage international competition.
In view of the enormous potential for material and ideal damage from manipulation and corruption in connection with the awarding of public works projects, both SAIs hold that it is the duty of the construction administrations to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, where possible, to improve them.
In particular, the organisational structures and processes of the contract award procedures should be monitored continuously for weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond to any need for corrective action.
Comparison of the Czech and the German practice indicates that the volume of open procedures offering the large space for competition and substantially decreasing the chances of corruption acts should be enforced in the Czech Republic.
Also, an increased segmentation of construction work into lots may positively impact on achieved price, if it results in more competition due to a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of contract award procedures is an essential basis for efficient public sector procurement.
In Germany, the procedures are organized by special state institutions, while in the Czech Republic, except of the transport constructions, they are organized by central institutions themselves or by their contractual entities.
The SAIs of both countries wish to further develop the findings relevant to their work and, where appropriate, to raise the related issues with their respective Parliament and Government even beyond the completion of their joint project.
Furthermore, both SAIs are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation described in this report are also matters of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), since the principles and findings expounded are of general importance for effectively curbing corruption and for ensuring that public works contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that good value for money is obtained.
