Sustainable use of plant protection products: limited progress in measuring and reducing risks
About the report: Plant protection products (PPPs) are pesticides used to protect crops. 
The EU framework aims to achieve sustainable use of PPPs by reducing risks and impacts on human health and environment and promoting integrated pest management. 
We found that the Commission and Member States have taken action to promote the sustainable use of PPPs but there has been limited progress in measuring and reducing the associated risks. 
Applying integrated pest management is compulsory for farmers, but not a requirement for receiving payments under the common agricultural policy and enforcement is weak. 
Available EU statistics and new risk indicators do not show how successful the policy has been in achieving a sustainable use of PPPs. 
We make recommendations related to verifying integrated pest management at farm level, improving PPP statistics and developing better risk indicators.
ECA special report pursuant to Article 287(4), second subparagraph, TFEU.
Executive summary
I
Plant protection products (PPP) are pesticides which farmers use to protect crops against harmful organisms, pests and diseases. 
In the EU, sales of the active substances used in PPPs exceed 350 000 tons per year. 
PPPs can impact water and soil quality, biodiversity and ecosystems, and they can end up as residues in food.
II
Since 1991, the EU has built up a framework of legislation to authorise PPP, promote their sustainable use and reduce the risk that using PPP poses for human health and the environment. 
The Commission approves active substances that can be used in PPPs authorised in the Member States and checks that Member States implement the relevant EU legislation. 
It also promotes integrated pest management to encourage the use of preventive, natural or other non-chemical methods of pest control before turning to PPPs.
III
The Commission is currently evaluating the legislation in this policy area against a background of increasing public and parliamentary concern regarding the risks associated with the use of pesticides. 
Our work was designed to complement this process.
IV
Our main objective was to assess whether EU action has reduced the risk related to PPP use. The Commission and Member States have taken action to promote the sustainable use of PPPs. 
However, we found that there is limited progress in measuring and reducing the risks of PPP use. 
Our work showed that EU action for sustainable use of PPPs was off to a slow start and allowed us to identify weaknesses in the current EU framework, as set out in this report.
V
We examined whether EU legislation provided effective incentives to reduce PPP dependency. 
EU rules require farmers to apply integrated pest management, meaning that they should only turn to PPPs if prevention and other methods fail or are not effective. 
Although it is compulsory for farmers to apply integrated pest management, they are not required to keep records of how they applied it and enforcement is weak.
VI
The common agricultural policy can help support sustainable PPP use through, for example, compulsory farm advisory systems and by providing financial support to measures such as organic farming and environmental schemes. 
Linking payments under the common agricultural policy to legal requirements can help in enforcing those rules, but applying integrated pest management is currently not a requirement for receiving payments under the common agricultural policy.
VII
Giving farmers access to alternative methods and lower risk products can help them in applying integrated pest management. 
The EU created a category of ‘low-risk PPP’ in 2009, but few of these have been made available for use to date.
VIII
We examined whether the Commission and Member States measured the risk and environmental impacts of PPP use and found that data collected and made available was not sufficient to allow effective monitoring. 
Available EU statistics on PPP sales are aggregated on a too high level to be useful and those on the agricultural use of PPP were not comparable.
IX
In November 2019, the Commission published its estimate of two new harmonised risk indicators. 
Neither indicator shows the extent to which the directive has been successful in achieving the EU objective of sustainable use of PPPs.
X
Based on these findings, we recommend that the Commission should:
check that the Member States convert the general principles of integrated pest management into practical criteria and that they verify them at farm level, allowing them to be linked to payments under the common agricultural policy in the post-2020 period;
improve statistics on PPPs when revising the legislation to make them more accessible, useful and comparable; and to assess the progress made towards policy objectives, improve the harmonised risk indicators, or develop new ones, taking account of the use of PPPs.
Introduction
EU policy on plant protection products
Plant protection products (PPP) are pesticides used to combat harmful organisms, pests and diseases, influence the life processes of plants, preserve plant products, or destroy or prevent growth of undesired plants or parts of plants. 
PPPs include insecticides, fungicides and herbicides.
Using PPPs can put pressure on the environment; it can pose risks to ground and surface water quality, soil quality, biodiversity, ecosystems and to human health, including through residues in food. 
PPPs sprayed on fields can enter the surrounding land and water (see Figure 1). 
PPPs affect plants and animals and can contribute to biodiversity loss1, including reductions in insect populations. 
For example, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services identified PPPs as one of the drivers of a declining pollinators’ population2.

Since 1991, the EU has had common rules on authorisation and use of PPPs (Member States previously had their own laws). 
Annex I sets out the most important EU legislation on PPPs. 
All PPPs undergo a two-step authorisation procedure: the Commission first approves active substances; after that, Member States can authorise commercial forms of PPPs containing approved active substances (see Annex II). 
EU approval criteria state that PPPs shall not have any harmful effects on human or animal health, and no unacceptable effects on the environment.
Member States regularly provide PPP statistics to the Commission and Eurostat publishes annual EU statistics related to active substances contained in PPPs sold3. 
Figure 2 shows that overall EU sales of the active substances used in PPP has remained rather stable in recent years. 
However, PPP sales do not directly correlate with the risks and impacts associated with their use. 
Risks and impacts posed by PPPs vary depending on their active substances, but also their composition and where, when and how users apply them in practice.

This data excludes confidential information, according to Eurostat estimate representing < 3 % of sales over the full dataset
The 2009 directive on sustainable use of pesticides4 (“the directive”) establishes a framework to achieve sustainable use of PPPs by reducing the risks and impacts of PPP use on human health and the environment and promoting integrated pest management (IPM).
IPM is a concept stemming from the 1970s that focuses in particular on preventing pest infestation and takes advantage of sustainable farming practices such as rotating different crops and selecting pest resistant seeds. 
It also includes monitoring of pests and setting sound threshold values that help to decide whether and when pest control is needed. 
Compared to routine application of PPPs, IPM is a more environmentally friendly approach combining ‘common sense’ practices. 
IPM is a means to reduce PPP dependency: when applying IPM, farmers use chemical PPPs only if necessary after exhausting preventive, physical, biological or other non-chemical methods of pest control (see Figure 3). 
IPM is an important part of the EU’s PPP policy and became mandatory in 20145.

Facilitating use of alternative methods and access to lower risk products can help to support more sustainable pest control. 
The 2009 PPP regulation6 (“the PPP regulation”) introduced the concept of low-risk PPPs. 
To be authorised as low-risk, a PPP can only contain active substances approved as low-risk7 and may not contain any ‘substances of concern’. 
As of September 2019, 16 active substances were approved as low-risk (3 % of the approved active substances). 
In addition, the PPP regulation introduced the concept of ‘basic substances’; the EU has approved 20 such substances that are predominantly used for purposes other than plant protection (e.g. in food).
The Commission, Member States and PPP users (e.g. farmers) all play a role in the EU’s PPP policy. 
Figure 4 sets out some of the key responsibilities relevant for this report.

Audit scope and approach
We decided to carry out an audit in the area of the EU’s PPP policy because of increasing interest from the public and our stakeholders (including the European Parliament). 
The Commission is currently evaluating the legislation in this policy area, and we expect our report to complement this evaluation.
Our main objective was to assess whether EU action has reduced the risk related to PPP use, focusing on the period following the 2009 revision of the EU PPP framework (see Annex I for a list of related key EU rules). 
To answer this question, we examined whether:
the EU framework provides incentives to reduce PPP dependency, including enforcing IPM and discouraging the use of ‘standard’ and higher risk PPPs; and the Commission and Member States measure the risk and environmental impacts of PPP use.
We did not seek to re-evaluate scientific assessments of PPPs.
We carried out the audit from February to September 2019. 
Our audit work included structured interviews at the Commission (Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety, Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, Directorate-General for Environment and Eurostat) and the European Food Safety Authority, document reviews and information visits to three Member States (France, Lithuania and the Netherlands). 
We selected these Member States based on geographical zones (South, North and Central)8 to reflect differences in agricultural practices and conditions as well as in efforts to reduce risks related to PPP use (promotion of IPM, research, financial support) and in the number of low-risk PPPs authorised. 
We visited Switzerland to understand how a non-EU country incorporates IPM-related conditions into direct payments to farmers. 
We reviewed 18 Member State national action plans9 related to reducing the risks of PPP use and 2014-2020 rural development programmes for measures related to PPPs and IPM, and interviewed 33 farmers selected at random for our Statement of Assurance exercise.
Observations
Sustainable use of plant protection products affected by a slow start
The first steps in putting the directive into practice were delayed
The 2009 directive establishes a framework to achieve sustainable use of PPPs and to promote IPM, including using alternative approaches and non-chemical methods. 
Member States had two years to transpose it into national law10.
The Commission checked the timeliness of the transposition and initiated infringement procedures against the two Member States11 that, by 2012, had not yet transposed the directive. 
However, the Commission did not check the completeness or correctness of Member States’ transposition. 
For example, we found that while France took measures to implement the directive, including promoting IPM, the IPM requirements have not been transposed into French law.
By 26 November 2012, the Member States had to prepare national action plans setting out, among other things, their quantitative objectives, targets and timelines for reducing the risks and impacts of PPP use. 
Figure 5 sets out key events and shows the timeline for putting the directive into practice.
Figure 5
Deadlines and actual timing of key events
Source: ECA based on the directive and Commission documents.
While just a third of the Member States submitted their national action plans to the Commission in line with the deadline, they had all submitted them by February 2014. 
The Commission sent warning letters to all Member States, raising weaknesses in their first national action plans and problematic areas in implementing the directive. 
The Commission did not submit its first report to the European Parliament and Council12, due in November 2014, until October 2017.
Member States have to review and, if needed, update their national action plans every five years. 
The deadlines for this review depend on the timing of the initial plans and range from 2016 to 2019, since Member States submitted their initial national action plans to the Commission on different dates.
Nearly three-quarters of the Member States were late with their review (eleven of them more than one year), based on their individual deadlines. 
At the time of our audit, the Commission was preparing its second report (due in November 2018) to the European Parliament and the Council.
The Commission has taken increased action since 2016
Since 2016, the Commission has taken increased action to promote and enforce implementation of the directive.
Commission initiatives include assessing national action plans and monitoring Member State actions to put the directive into practice.
The Commission sent a questionnaire to the Member States and visited six of them to collect information on the implementation of the directive. 
An overview report13 summarises main findings, gives examples of good practice on for example water protection, training and IPM and identifies the main obstacles facing Member States in implementing the directive.
Several Member States reported difficulties with checking IPM and lack of financially viable, effective non-chemical control techniques as hindrances to putting IPM into practice. 
In 2018, the Commission moved from fact-finding visits to compliance audits, and started making recommendations and requesting corrective action from Member States.
The Commission regularly invites Member State authorities to meetings to discuss implementation of the directive. 
It has launched a web portal for sustainable use of PPPs, which includes key information, national action plans and links to official Member State websites14.
Research and innovation activities are important to ensure that alternative pest management methods and low-risk PPPs are available to implement IPM.
The EU supports research to make available economically feasible alternative pest control methods.
Horizon 2020, the EU research programme, includes calls for projects related to strategies, tools and technologies for sustainable weed management, alternatives to PPP use and for IPM.
The European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural productivity and Sustainability aims to integrate different funding streams and bring together farmers, advisors, researchers, agribusinesses, nongovernmental organisations and other actors as partners in agricultural innovation.
The resulting network connects large-scale research and innovation projects financed under Horizon 2020 with smaller operational groups working at national and regional level, with the aim of bridging the gap between research and practice.
EU action provides weak incentives for farmers to adopt integrated pest management
The Commission and Member States promote IPM but its enforcement is weak
One important measure in achieving sustainable use of PPPs is IPM.
EU rules define IPM as a set of eight general principles (see Annex III) aimed at using other preventive, natural or less harmful methods of pest control before turning to chemical PPPs (see also Figure 3).
The possibility to refer to IPM on PPP labels is a way to raise awareness.
During our Member State visits, we only found one example of indications directly related to IPM: some labels in Lithuania included instructions aimed at avoiding pests becoming resistant to the PPP in question.
The Commission and Member States have taken action to promote and spread awareness about IPM.
All the national action plans we reviewed included information about training activities, knowledge sharing and tools for pest monitoring and decision-making.
For example, pest monitoring and early warning systems are an integral part of IPM, as they help farmers to apply preventive and more targeted pest control measures.
The Commission found that most (24) Member States had publicly funded systems in place for forecasting, warning and early diagnosis for pest and disease control.
For example, Lithuania developed an interactive IT system combining different aspects of supporting PPP users in applying IPM (see Figure 6).

EU rules require PPP users to apply the general principles of IPM15, and Member States had to describe in their national action plans how they would ensure that all professional users16 applied the IPM principles by January 201417.
The Commission noted shortcomings in ensuring application of IPM in the initial national action plans and in its 2017 report to the European Parliament and Council (see paragraph 15), it indicated that Member States should develop criteria to assess whether farmers had applied IPM.
Our review showed that most (12 out of 18) of the revised national action plans did not describe how the Member States ensure that all professional users implement the general principles of IPM.
In 2009, the Commission used an external contractor to prepare a guidance document18 for establishing IPM principles.
The document aimed to assist Member States in considering IPM in their national action plans and offered guidance on monitoring compliance.
Nevertheless, the national action plans mainly focused on training, advisory activities and awareness-raising to increase understanding of IPM.
The national action plans did not set specific requirements translating the general IPM principles into actions that could be checked in practice.
Professional PPP users have to keep records of the products they use for at least three years19.
IPM principle number 8 requires them to check the success of their plant protection measures based on records of PPP use and on pest monitoring.
There is no EU requirement for users to keep records of other IPM actions, and the Commission has encouraged Member States to introduce such obligations in national law.
Only a few Member States have done so (see example in Box 1).
Box 1
Irish farmers maintain IPM records
In Ireland, all professional users must keep records to prove implementation of IPM20.
Farmers record the reason for using PPPs, including information e.g.
on the type of pest present, preventative measures taken, resistance management, thresholds applied and crop damage.
The Commission identified enforcement of IPM as a weakness during its 2018 and 2019 Member State audits.
Most (27 out of 33) of the farmers we interviewed said that they were familiar with IPM and that they applied the principles on their farms, indicating a significant awareness of the concept amongst farmers.
However, the Member States we visited could not confirm the proportion of users complying with the IPM principles, and they do not check this during inspections.
Assessing compliance requires expertise and is difficult because it depends on the crop, soil type, farm size and external factors such as weather and type of pest.
Member States are required to lay down the rules on penalties for breaches of PPP rules.
Of the three Member States we visited, only the Netherlands had defined penalties related to IPM.
The Commission’s audits and our Member State visits showed no good examples of checking that farmers apply the IPM principles.
See Box 2 for examples from the Member States we visited.
Box 2
Few Member States check application of IPM principles
In France, PPP inspections cover the use of monitoring methods and tools and whether farmers use biological PPPs and methods aimed at reducing the use of chemical PPPs, but no penalties have been defined for related non-compliances.
In Lithuania, inspectors fill in an IPM questionnaire to collect information on farmers’ knowledge and practical implementation of IPM.
Inspectors verify replies with supporting documents and other evidence where possible.
However, they do not assess compliance with IPM principles and, consequently, they neither detect infringements of IPM requirements nor apply penalties.
In the Netherlands, inspectors check that PPP users have documented their considerations related to IPM in a ‘plant protection monitor’, which users may do in any form they choose.
However, the inspectors do not verify the content by checking underlying documents.
The Dutch rules set fines for not filling in the plant protection monitor, but in practice, the authorities did not apply any in 2017 despite having found 20 % of the users they checked to be non-compliant.
The common agricultural policy does little to help enforce IPM
At the Commission, the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development is responsible for the common agricultural policy (CAP).
The CAP includes instruments that can support farmers’ sustainable use of PPPs.
For example:
Member States have to set up farm advisory systems to offer advice to all farmers, including on IPM;
farmers with more than 15 hectares of arable land who receive direct payments should maintain ecological focus areas on 5 % of their arable land and since 2018, may not use PPPs on these areas; and
specific programmes for the fruit and vegetable sector promote the uptake of IPM.
In addition, Member States can use CAP measures financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to promote sustainable use of PPPs, including IPM.
Such measures include agri-environment and climate commitments, where Member States can grant payments for input management (PPPs and/or fertilisers) and sustainable farming practices in the context of integrated farming.
Member States can also use the CAP to support organic farming, referred to in the directive as a type of “low pesticide-input pest management”21.
The area under organic farming represents 7 % of total EU agricultural land22.
Other relevant measures include support for investments in, for example, precision farming equipment.
Member States plan specific measures in rural development programmes.
Most CAP payments are subject to ‘cross-compliance’23.
Cross-compliance is a mechanism linking CAP payments to compliance by farmers with basic standards concerning the environment, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare, as well as the requirement to maintain land in good agricultural and environmental condition.
Linking CAP payments to legal requirements can help in enforcing those rules.
Member States must check compliance with cross-compliance rules and carry out on-the-spot visits to at least 1 % of farmers receiving CAP payments.
Cross-compliance does not mean that CAP payments are conditional upon meeting these basic standards, but Member States impose administrative penalties on beneficiaries who do not comply.
Administrative penalties are in practice reductions, not exceeding 5 % for breaches due to negligence.
Reoccurring breaches can result in higher penalties and, if the non-compliance is intentional, the reduction could be 20 % or higher24.
Cross-compliance for the 2014-2020 CAP requires that PPP users comply with conditions established on the labels and take into account local conditions25 but it does not incorporate the directive including application of the IPM principles.
Other cross-compliance requirements, such as buffer strips and protection of groundwater, are also relevant for sustainable PPP use.
In comparison, to receive direct payments in Switzerland, farmers have to show ‘proof of ecological performance’26 similar to the general principles of IPM defined in the directive.
As part of their inspections, the Swiss authorities verify requirements related to protecting soil and promoting biodiversity, establishing and recording pest thresholds and to the appropriate choice of PPP and justification for use and, for farmers with more than three hectares of arable land, crop rotation.
Recital 35 of the PPP regulation states that the principles of IPM should be included in cross-compliance.
At the beginning of the 2014-2020 CAP period, the legislator27 invited the Commission, once all Member States had implemented the directive and the obligations directly applicable to farmers had been identified, to propose amending the CAP rules to include relevant parts of the directive in cross-compliance.
The Commission did not make such proposal for the 2014-2020 CAP.
The Commission’s post-2020 CAP proposal expands the link between CAP payments and statutory requirements (‘conditionality’28) related to PPPs.
It would partially cover sustainable use but it would not incorporate the IPM principles.
The new statutory management requirement 13 would refer to the directive and cover, related to PPPs, the establishment of certification systems, inspection of equipment, restrictions on use in protected areas, and handling and storage.
The proposed ‘good agricultural and environmental condition’ 8 would require crop rotation to preserve soil potential.
The proposed ‘conditionality’, just as the current mechanism of ‘cross-compliance’, does not mean that CAP payments are conditional upon meeting these rules.
Instead, Member States would impose administrative penalties on beneficiaries who do not comply with these requirements.
Linking CAP payments to applying IPM can help in ensuring that farmers put it into practice.
Non-chemical methods are evolving, but the number of low-risk PPPs is low
There is an increased focus on non-chemical methods, and many Member States promote concepts such as bio-control (France) and bio-pesticides (the Netherlands).
The directive states that IPM “encourages natural pest control”29, and the IPM principles indicate that biological methods should be preferred to chemical ones30.
Whenever possible, priority should be given to non-chemical methods31, defined as alternative methods including biological pest control32.
EU legislation also mentions biological products33, but it does not include a definition of biological pest control or of biological products.
The EU concept of low-risk PPPs focuses on risk, but the nature of the active substance makes a difference for the approval procedure.
For example, assessing microorganisms requires different data than is needed to assess chemical substances.
EU rules include separate data requirements and assessment principles for microorganisms34, and the Commission has set up a working group to assess the data requirements and assessment principles with a view to updating them.
While most low-risk PPPs contain microorganisms, many ‘biological’ PPPs are not categorised as low-risk.
For example, in France, as of June 2019, 481 PPPs were authorised as bio-control and 23 as low-risk.
One reason for this is that many of the bio-control PPPs include active substances approved before the introduction of the low-risk concept in EU legislation35, but the approval process also shows that not all non-chemical active substances meet the low-risk criteria.
As of September 2019, there are 48736 active substances approved for use in PPPs in the EU but only 16 (3 %) of them approved as low-risk.
Of the approved active substances, the Commission identified 57 as potentially low-risk37, and prioritised their renewal over that of other active substances38.
The Commission and many Member States promote low-risk PPPs.
However, in France, such promotion measures (e.g. exemption from ban on commercial advertising) are directed towards bio-control rather than low-risk PPPs.
Some of the farmers (14 of 33) we interviewed had heard about low-risk PPPs, but none of them had used any.
By contrast, all interviewed farmers had heard about (or used) biological, physical (mechanical) or other non-chemical methods of pest control.
Not all PPPs based on the 16 low-risk active substances are themselves authorised as low-risk.
One reason for this is that, besides active substances, PPPs contain other ingredients known as ‘co-formulants’.
For a PPP to be authorised as low-risk, all co-formulants have to be ‘of no concern’.
Another is that some PPPs are subject to ‘specific mitigation measures’39 which have been identified as necessary in a risk assessment.
Risk mitigation measures are aimed at minimising human and environmental exposure to a PPP, for example by wearing protective equipment such as gloves or respecting an unsprayed buffer zone.
‘General risk mitigation measures’ are those considered normal precaution and do not prevent PPPs from being authorised as low-risk.
Our audit work shows that the visited Member States sometimes assess mitigation measures differently.
For example, in the Netherlands two PPPs containing the low-risk active substance ferric phosphate were not authorised as low-risk because it was considered necessary to wear protective gloves.
The Dutch authorities considered this to be a specific mitigation measure.
France and Lithuania have authorised both PPPs as low-risk.
The labelling requirements include wearing protective gloves, but the Member State authorities consider this a normal precaution.
EU rules do not define what counts as a ‘specific mitigation measure’ (as opposed to a ‘general mitigation measure’), and there is no guidance on the subject.
EU rules include an accelerated timeline for the authorisation of low-risk PPPs.
Data from the three Member States we visited shows that the authorisation of low-risk PPPs is faster than authorisation of ‘standard’ PPPs (see Figure 7).

It is not meant to reflect compliance with legal deadlines, as certain activities during the authorisation are exempt from these deadlines.

In order to help farmers access low-risk PPPs and to promote IPM, the Council in 2016 endorsed an “Implementation Plan on increasing low-risk plant protection product availability and accelerating integrated pest management implementation in Member States”.
The plan sets 40 actions for the Commission, Member States and external stakeholders.
The actions for low-risk PPPs focused on speeding up the authorisation procedure, considering reduced fees and providing guidance.
The Expert Group on Sustainable Plant Protection presented the status of the actions taken in a progress report40.
The implementation plan has increased awareness among Member States, the Commission and stakeholders of the low-risk concept, but the number of low-risk PPPs remains small.
The Commission did not start calculating EU-wide risk indicators for the use of plant protection products until 2019
Member States monitor active substances in water, but there is no EU-wide data on PPP use
Environmental monitoring is necessary to confirm that there are no unacceptable effects or risks for the environment resulting from PPP use.
Environmental monitoring provides a warning system and complements the risk assessment carried out during the authorisation procedure41.
Member States can require PPP producers to monitor the effects of authorised PPPs42.
The Commission does not have an overview of such monitoring.
In practice, Member States mainly carry out environmental monitoring under other legislation, including EU rules on water monitoring43.
Member States must monitor several active substances, and relevant residues in ground, surface and drinking water.
For surface water, the EU defines substances that Member States must monitor; 36 of these are active substances, of which ten are currently approved for use in PPPs44.
Member States have to monitor additional substances beyond those specified by EU law, if emitted in significant quantities.
For example, the Netherlands has an extensive water monitoring system and complements the monitoring of the EU defined substances with an additional 16 active substances deemed problematic in their surface waters (12 of which are currently approved for use in PPPs in the EU).
EU rules do not define active substances to monitor in soil45; however, the Commission recently gathered soil samples as part of a land use survey.
The Joint Research Centre will analyse these samples46.
Member States gather statistics for sales and agricultural use of PPPs.
EU law requires them to collect data annually on active substances contained in PPPs sold, and to compile statistics on the agricultural use of PPPs for selected crops during a reference period every five years47.
The Member States transmit statistics on each active substance to Eurostat.
Under EU rules on statistical confidentiality, confidential data may be used only for statistical purposes48, and detailed statistics may not expose the identity of ‘statistical units’ (in this case: individual PPP producers or users).
In relation to PPPs, however, EU legislation is even more restrictive, requiring Eurostat to aggregate active substances in a specific way before publication49 and preventing it from publishing detailed statistics or sharing them with other Directorates-General.
Publicly available EU PPP statistics relate to active substances contained in PPPs sold.
These are aggregated into major groups, such as insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, based on the EU legislation referred to above.
This means, for example, that the Commission cannot publish information on individual active substances or on the proportion of substances approved as low-risk.
In some countries (e.g. France), sales data for individual active substances is publicly available.
The Commission supports publishing sales figures on all individual active substances that are not protected by statistical confidentiality50.
Eurostat has not so far published EU-wide statistics collected by each Member State on PPP use.
Member States send statistics on agricultural use of PPPs to the Commission (Eurostat) every five years51, starting from 2015.
Member States are required to gather statistics on agricultural use of PPP for a reference period of maximum 12 months chosen by the Member State at any time within a five-year period.
Member States also select the crops to monitor, meaning that data are not comparable between Member States.
The wide variety of crops and reference periods chosen by Member States for their use statistics prevented Eurostat from usefully combining and comparing the data, and it therefore opted to publish only a selection of the use data52.
Sales data per active substance (instead of aggregated into groups as currently required by EU rules) could help to select substances to monitor and to target environmental monitoring.
Better statistics on PPP use could help in interpreting monitoring results and these results would be more meaningful when assessing risks from use of authorised PPPs.
Statistics that are more detailed would help the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety to follow market trends and to analyse the potential impact of approval decisions.
It could also help in developing more useful assessments of the overall risks associated with using PPPs.
The usefulness of the EU-wide PPP risk indicators is limited
The EU policy framework aims to “achieve a sustainable use of pesticides by reducing the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment”.
However, it does not define ‘sustainable use’, and the aim to ‘reduce the risks and impacts of pesticide use’ is not translated into a specific quantified EU target.
Setting specific and measurable objectives and targets is useful in order to assess a policy’s performance against the desired outcome.
The Member States have to include quantitative objectives and targets in their national action plans to achieve the aims of the directive.
The Commission during its assessment noted great variation in the quality of the initial national action plans and shortcomings in setting measurable targets.
Our review of 18 revised national action plans showed that twelve of them include action-based or compliance-based quantitative objectives and targets.
Few (2 out of 18) of them have quantified overall objectives or targets to reduce use of or risks related to PPP.
EU-wide risk indicators are necessary to measure progress in meeting the main objective of the directive: reducing the risks and impacts of PPP use.
Measuring risk is complex as the risks posed by PPPs vary according to several factors, particularly their active substances, but also their composition, application rate (i.e. quantity per hectare and frequency) and where, when and how users apply them in practice.
The EU-wide risk indicators need to be harmonised to allow comparison between Member States and a meaningful assessment of the EU’s policy.
The directive requires Member States to calculate harmonised risk indicators, identify trends in the use of certain active substances and identify priority items that require particular attention.
However, the directive itself did not establish any such harmonised risk indicators; the legislator adopted it in 2009 with an empty Annex (“Annex IV – Harmonised risk indicators”).
Some Member States have developed national indicators for measuring risks and impact.
Such national indicators are useful for measuring progress towards Member States’ objectives and targets but not comparable across Member States, which is why harmonised risk indicators are useful to measure EU-wide risk and impact.
Initial Commission attempts to develop indicators were unsuccessful due to the lack of data.
In 2018, the Commission proposed two harmonised risk indicators, which came into force in June 201953.
The two indicators are aimed at estimating trends in the overall risk from PPP use, for each Member State and EU-wide.
The Commission published the retrospective calculations of the risk indicators from 2011 on its website54 in November 2019.
This means that the Commission’s first estimate of EU-wide risks from PPP use came ten years after adoption of the directive.
Neither indicator takes into account how, where and when these PPPs are used as this information is not available to the Commission.
One indicator is based on PPP sales statistics and the other is based on the number of emergency authorisations.
Member States can grant emergency authorisations without carrying out the standard authorisation procedure if pests cause a danger that cannot be contained in any other reasonable way.
Emergency authorisations can relate to PPPs already authorised for other uses or PPPs containing approved active substances not yet authorised in the specific Member State granting the emergency authorisation.
For both indicators, active substances are categorised, based on the PPP regulation, into four groups (‘low-risk’, ‘standard’, ‘candidates for substitution’ and ‘not approved’) with different weightings (see illustration in Figure 8).
For PPPs containing active substances that are ‘candidates for substitution’ Member States have to refuse or restrict authorisation where less harmful alternatives are available55.
The aim is to promote less harmful substances and provide industry incentives to develop less hazardous alternatives.
The weighting is intended to reflect policy choices and to support the objective of the directive to reduce the risks and impacts of PPP.
Some Member States raised concerns regarding justification of these weightings.
They questioned the scientific rationale for the weightings.
A different weighting factor would change the result of the indicators.

The two harmonised risk indicators
Source: ECA based Commission Directive (EU) 2019/782.
The harmonised risk indicators are presented as indices (baseline 100) to make it possible to follow risk trends from 2011 and to protect confidential data.
The Commission’s graph for the harmonised risk indicator based on sales shows a risk reduction resulting mainly from reduced sales of the substances in the category ‘not approved’.
The weighting factors chosen increase the estimated risk reduction resulting from reduced sales of higher risk substances.
The indicator does not show how successful the directive has been in achieving the EU objective of sustainable use of PPPs.
The Commission told us that it intends to improve the risk indicators; access to better statistics and data on PPP use could help it in doing so.
Conclusions and recommendations
Overall, the Commission and Member States have taken action to promote the sustainable use of PPPs.
However, we found that there is limited progress in measuring and reducing the risks of PPP use.
Implementation of the sustainable use part of the EU’s PPP policy was affected by a slow start.
The Commission did not check proper Member State transposition of the directive (see paragraphs 12 to 16).
In recent years, both the Commission and Member States have taken increased action intended to reduce the risk related to PPP use including efforts to put IPM into practice (see paragraphs 17 to 20).
Applying the IPM principles is mandatory for users, but Member State compliance checks have a limited scope.
One reason for the lack of enforcement is that there are no clear criteria as to how users should apply the general principles of IPM or how the authorities should assess compliance (see paragraphs 21 to 27).
Several CAP measures can contribute to the implementation of the directive, for example by promoting IPM and organic farming.
CAP rules also require Member States to establish farm advisory systems and provide advice on IPM to all farmers.
However, while the IPM principles are mandatory for farmers, they are not included as a condition for CAP payments.
Despite encouragement for more sustainable farming practices, there are few measures deterring farmers from using ‘standard’ PPPs rather than turning to non-chemical or alternative methods (see paragraphs 28 to 35).
Recommendation 1 – Enable IPM enforcement
The Commission should
check that the Member States convert the general IPM principles into practical and measurable criteria and that they verify these criteria at farm level; and
incorporate these measurable IPM criteria into ‘conditionality’ in the post-2020 CAP and ensure they are enforced.
Timeframe: 2022
When applying IPM, users should turn to PPPs only if prevention and other methods fail or are not effective.
If pest-monitoring shows a need for control measures, EU rules indicate that biological, physical and other non-chemical methods must be preferred to chemical ones.
EU legislation also mentions biological pest control and biological products concepts but does not define them.
The concept of low-risk PPP was introduced in 2009 but to date, few active substances are approved as low-risk.
The Commission and Member States are taking actions to increase availability of low risk PPPs but there is a need for further efforts to meet the timelines set for authorisation (see paragraphs 36 to 40).
Environmental monitoring is important to confirm that there are no unacceptable effects or risks for the environment resulting from PPP use.
EU monitoring of PPPs in the environment focuses mainly on water (see paragraphs 44 to 47).
PPP statistics published by Eurostat relate to active substances contained in PPPs sold, grouped in a specific way defined in EU legislation.
This limits the information Eurostat can publish or even share with other Directorates-General of the Commission to a greater degree than can be justified by statistical confidentiality alone.
Statistics collected on agricultural use of PPPs under current EU legislation are not comparable, and Eurostat has to date not been able to publish EU-wide use statistics (see paragraphs 48 to 51).
Better data on sales and use of PPPs, including more geographical information, could be used to improve measuring of related environmental risks and impact, including for example in water bodies used for abstraction of drinking water.
Access to more monitoring data could help in targeting activities to address environmental impact of PPP use (see paragraph 52).
Recommendation 2 – Improve access to PPP statistics
To improve statistics and environmental monitoring, the Commission should address the following issues when revising the PPP statistics regulation:
removing restrictive aggregation requirements for PPP statistics (Article 3(4)) to allow publication of more useful statistics (e.g.low-risk PPPs and active substances with specific properties); and
clarifying, improving and harmonising the requirements for EU statistics on agricultural use of PPPs (Annex II) to make it more available, comparable and useful.
Timeframe: 2023
The objective of the directive is to reduce the risks and impacts related to PPP use.
In November 2019, the Commission published its estimation of the EU-wide risks and impacts related to PPP use by calculating the two recently adopted harmonised risk indicators (see paragraphs 53 to 58).
Neither of the indicators show the extent to which the directive has been successful in achieving the EU objective of sustainable use of PPPs.
The first indicator’s (using sales statistics for active substances contained in PPPs as a basis) usefulness is limited by not taking into account how, when and where PPPs are used.
Confidentiality rules also limit detailed and useful analysis.
The second indicator is based on number of emergency authorisations granted by Member States.
Although it can be valuable to collect data on the number of emergency authorisations, the number of authorisations does not say anything about use or associated risks (see paragraphs 59 to 63).
Recommendation 3 – Develop better risk indicators
To assess the progress made towards policy objectives, the Commission should improve the harmonised risk indicators, or develop new ones that take into account, for Harmonised Risk Indicator II, agricultural areas or volumes of active substance, for Harmonised Risk Indicator I, the way PPPs are used.
Timeframe: 2023

Annex II – Key steps in assessing PPP safety in the EU
EU approval of active substance
Company X submits an application for the approval of active substance Y to an EU Member State, with the intention of including it in plant protection product (PPP) Z.
The rapporteur Member State (RMS) scientifically and technically evaluates the active substance and prepares an assessment report.
The European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) is in charge of risk assessment.
It conducts a public consultation and, together with the EU Member States, carries out a peer review of the assessment report prepared by the RMS.
EFSA sends its conclusions to the European Commission.
The Commission is in charge of risk management.
Based on EFSAs conclusions, it proposes whether or not to approve substance Y to a regulatory Committee composed of Member States representatives.
The Committee votes and delivers an opinion on the proposal, after which the Commission adopts a regulation approving or refusing approval of the active substance Y.
Member State authorisation of PPP
Member States decide whether to authorise PPP Z (and other PPPs) containing the approved active substance Y for use, taking into account the agricultural and environmental circumstances in their territory.
Holder of an authorisation in one Member State may obtain an authorisation (following local review) in another Member State for the same PPP Z used under comparable conditions (principle of mutual recognition).

Annex III – The general principles of IPM as defined in Annex III to the directive
(1) The prevention and/or suppression of harmful organisms should be achieved or supported among other options especially by:
crop rotation,
use of adequate cultivation techniques (e.g.stale seedbed technique, sowing dates and densities, under-sowing, conservation tillage, pruning and direct sowing), 
use, where appropriate, of resistant/tolerant cultivars and standard/certified seed and planting material,
use of balanced fertilisation, liming and irrigation/drainage practices,
preventing the spreading of harmful organisms by hygiene measures (e.g.by regular cleansing of machinery and equipment), 
protection and enhancement of important beneficial organisms, e.g. by adequate plant protection measures or the utilisation of ecological infrastructures inside and outside production sites.
(2) Harmful organisms must be monitored by adequate methods and tools, where available.
Such adequate tools should include observations in the field as well as scientifically sound warning, forecasting and early diagnosis systems, where feasible, as well as the use of advice from professionally qualified advisors.
(3) Based on the results of the monitoring the professional user has to decide whether and when to apply plant protection measures.
Robust and scientifically sound threshold values are essential components for decision making.
For harmful organisms threshold levels defined for the region, specific areas, crops and particular climatic conditions must be taken into account before treatments, where feasible.
(4) Sustainable biological, physical and other non-chemical methods must be preferred to chemical methods if they provide satisfactory pest control.
(5) The pesticides applied shall be as specific as possible for the target and shall have the least side effects on human health, non-target organisms and the environment.
(6) The professional user should keep the use of pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are necessary, e.g. by reduced doses, reduced application frequency or partial applications, considering that the level of risk in vegetation is acceptable and they do not increase the risk for development of resistance in populations of harmful organisms.
(7) Where the risk of resistance against a plant protection measure is known and where the level of harmful organisms requires repeated application of pesticides to the crops, available anti-resistance strategies should be applied to maintain the effectiveness of the products.
This may include the use of multiple pesticides with different modes of action.
(8) Based on the records on the use of pesticides and on the monitoring of harmful organisms the professional user should check the success of the applied plant protection measures.
Terms and abbreviations
Active substances: The active component against pests or plant diseases in a plant protection product.
Candidate for substitution: Active substances with certain properties for which EU countries are required to evaluate if they can be replaced (substituted) by other adequate solutions (chemical and non-chemical).
CAP: Common agricultural policy.
Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Careful consideration of all available plant protection methods and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of populations of harmful organisms and keep the use of plant protection products and other forms of intervention to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and reduce or minimise risks to human health and the environment.
‘Integrated pest management’ emphasises the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms.
Low-risk plant protection products: Products containing active substances that have been approved as low-risk can be authorised as a low-risk plant protection products.
An active substance can be approved as a low-risk substance if it meets the regular approval criteria and in addition meets the low-risk criteria as specified in Annex II, point 5 of Regulation (EC) 1107/2009.
Pesticides: Plant protection products and biocidal products.

Replies of the Commission
Executive summary
I
The Commission has invested significant efforts in ensuring the implementation of the Sustainable Use Directive (SUD), including the development of Harmonised Risk Indicators.
While Harmonised Risk Indicator I, based on the quantities of active substances placed on the market, shows a reduction in risk since the entry into force of the SUD, there remains significant potential for further risk reduction through better implementation of the SUD and, in particular, greater adoption of integrated pest management, including the more widespread adoption of non-chemical pest control techniques.
II
Beyond integrated pest management, organic farming is also an essential measure to achieve sustainable use of Plant Protection Products (PPP)56 and an EU regulatory framework establishes since 1991 specific requirements for organic production, in particular restricting the use of PPPs and mostly excluding synthetic chemicals.
IV
The Commission considers that EU action has resulted in risk reduction from PPP use.
Despite a slow start, there was considerable effort by the Commission to improve implementation of Directive 2009/128/EC by Member States.
The Commission has also calculated a 20 % reduction in the Harmonised Risk Indicator I between 2011 and 2017.
V
The Commission found good examples of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) implementation and promotion in several Member States57.
Enforcement of IPM still needs to be improved in the Member States as demonstrated in the Commission’s 2017 report to the European Parliament and the Council and individual audit reports from audits to Member States performed in 2018 and 2019, published on DG Health and Food Safety website58.
VI
The Commission agrees that the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) can help support sustainable PPP and considers that many requirements relevant for sustainable use are already included.
However, more could be done to take into account the legal framework and the proposal for a future CAP includes relevant verifiable elements of the Directive, including for integrated pest management,
VIII
The Commission is constrained by the statistical legislation in force concerning data confidentiality and aggregation.
The Commission communicated the weaknesses linked to the availability of statistics in its report to the European Parliament and the Council59 in 2017.
The Commission agrees that the availability of EU statistics on PPP sales and agricultural use should be improved and has started to explore the possibilities of improving legislation in this respect.
X
First indent; The Commission accepts the first part of the recommendation and partially accepts the second part of the recommendation related to the common agricultural policy.
The Commission’s legal proposal for a future CAP includes those general IPM principles corresponding to requirements that are measurable and which can be checked at farm level.
However, it is the responsibility of Member States to define on-farm obligations related to conditionality rules on the basis of the EU legislation, including IPM provisions.
Second indent: The Commission accepts the recommendation.
The Commission is exploring the possibilities of improving legislation in this respect.
However, whether legislation will be proposed is not known at the time of this report.
Third indent: The Commission partially accepts recommendation 3.
It will take the actions recommended.
However, it considers that achieving the timeline proposed will require Member State agreement to provide the relevant data.
Observations
At the time of transposition in 2010/2011 the Commission, did not make an in-depth and systematic check of the completeness or correctness of the legal texts through which Member States transposed the SUD, but verified through several surveys and studies that transposition had taken place.
Furthermore, the Commission discussed with the Member States in the Working Group on the SUD, conducted an assessment of National Action Plans, organised training, as well as workshops and projects, which allowed exchanges with Member States experts to share practices on how some provisions of the SUD were transposed and implemented.
Since then various measures have been taken to ensure harmonised implementation, and the audits and fact-finding missions conducted by the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety check if there are any deficiencies linked to problems of transposition.
Common reply to paragraphs 15 and 16: Despite the slow start, the sustainable use of PPP has seen increased action since 2016.
For the purposes of the second Commission report to the EP and the Council, the Commission evaluated Member States revised national action plans, submitted by the end of February 2019.
Following on from Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe – the next research and innovation framework programme will continue to support IPM related activities.
H2020 multi-actor research and EIP Operational Group innovation projects (CAP) ensure that IPM solutions and knowledge flows on IPM practices between the actors in Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) are co-created together with the end-users and, as a result, increase the uptake of those innovations in practice.
Sustainable, biological, physical and other non-chemical methods must be preferred to chemical methods if they provide satisfactory pest control.
The Commission invested a lot of time and resources to develop and launch the Better Training for Safer Food (BTSF) training programme on IPM.
Moreover, the Commission provided support for putting IPM into practice by arranging a workshop for Member States in May 2019.
Implementation and enforcement of IPM is an aspect systematically covered during audits to Member States.
Any weaknesses identified result in issuing recommendations to Member State authorities, and these are systematically followed-up to ensure that adequate corrective actions are taken by the authorities.
As of 01 January 2014, PPP professional users should apply IPM general principles, listed in Annex III of the SUD.
Criteria for assessment of IPM implementation are of importance for the authorities to apply during inspections at farm level to conclude on compliance or non-compliance.
In its 2017 report to the EP and the Council , the Commission pointed out that enforcement of IPM in the Member States still needs to be improved.
Implementation and enforcement of IPM is an aspect systematically covered during audits to Member States.
Any weaknesses identified result in issuing recommendations to Member State authorities, and these are systematically followed-up to ensure that adequate corrective actions are taken by the authorities.
Common reply to paragraphs 28 to 31:
The Commission considers that the current CAP does not do little but on the contrary, helps enforce IPM at farm level.
The instruments quoted by the ECA and a number of other instruments available to Member States are and will be in the future relevant and effective for the sustainable use of pesticides and IPM.
Under the direct payments, the CAP “greening” scheme includes a minimum share of biodiversity area but also crop diversification, which are both relevant for the IPM.
Rural development policy also supports restrictions of pesticides due to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive.
In addition to investments in respective equipment, the CAP also supports knowledge transfer and information actions as well as advisory services for farmers, including the promotion of IPM.
The cooperation between farmers, researchers and advisory services, promoted through the European Innovation Partnership (EIP AGRI), is also important and may cover innovative ways to reduce the use of PPPs and implement IPM.
The CAP also includes the regulatory framework for organic farming (12.
mio ha in 2017), with possible financial support under rural development.
Organic production applies specific principles and sets requirements going beyond the principles of IPM, which among others requires crop rotation and severe restriction on which PPPs maybe used.
Farm advisory services may also offer advice on organic farming.
To complement the CAP, research is also very important for the development of IPM.
See reply to paragraph 20.
The proposal for a future CAP consolidates these contributions on the sustainable use of PPPs and IPM.
It furthermore proposes to include in the future conditionality the most relevant parts of the IPM principles, in particular crop rotation and requirements for biodiversity areas, as well as the other relevant provisions of the SUD.
Importantly, the Commission proposes better integration of the system for advising farmers and better integration with research and knowledge transfer from the CAP networks.
With Pillar I eco-schemes and Pillar II management commitments, Member States will also have much more flexibility than in the current period 2014-2020 to better tailor the support of practices of sustainable use of pesticides and IPM taking account of their own particular needs assessments.
Many practices relevant to IPM are currently part of EU requirements and accordingly inspected.
Cross compliance includes inter alia requirements protecting soil and promoting biodiversity and for the proper use of pesticides.
The current requirements of greening include crop diversification (as for Switzerland) and areas promoting biodiversity.
The declaration made by the legislator to include when appropriate the relevant parts of the Directive in cross-compliance was made at the stage of the adoption of the legislation for the 2014-2020 period.
It was therefore not possible for the Commission to make this change from the outset of the 2014-2020 CAP.
The Commission considered that it was more appropriate to propose it in the next CAP reform than during the 2014-2020 period.
The Commission considers that the future conditionality framework incorporates IPM general principles fit for conditionality.
The future framework of standards of good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC) will include compulsory crop rotation (GAEC 8) and biodiversity areas (GAEC 9) which are important elements of the general principle 1.
Member States may also cover the examples specified in this general principle 1 with GAEC 1 (maintenance of permanent grassland), GAEC 2 (protection of peatland and wetland), GAEC 3 (buffer strips), GAEC 5 (farm sustainability tool for nutrient), GAEC 6 (tillage management) and GAEC 7 (no bare soil).
The the future framework of conditionality will cover conditions for proper use of PPPs with Statutory Management Requirements (SMR) 12, which sets the legal framework for the general IPM principles 5, 6 and 7.
This includes using the PPPs on the relevant crop, at the right dose and the right frequency, at the right moment and taking into account environmental and resistance impacts.
The other general IPM principles (principles 2, 3 and 8) are based on general approaches to be followed by the farmer, and are therefore not fit for conditionality.
However, the FAS, which are an essential instrument to ensure implementation of IPM will continue in the future CAP addressing all the general IPM principles.
The Commission has set up a working group to assess the data requirements and assessment principles with a view to updating them to facilitate the approval of such active substances.
A further reason is that such PPPs include co-formulants that meet the definition of a substance of concern, which excludes the PPP from being considered low-risk.
The Commission notes that Figure 7 indicates that in the Netherlands and France the deadlines specified in the PPP Regulation are not respected.
There are significant differences between the Member States and the Commission has actually delivered on all actions attributed to it in the Implementation Plan.
This is demonstrated in the progress report presented to the AGRIFISH Council in July 2019.
Several of the substances no longer approved for use in PPPs that are still monitored in surface waters have only recently been disallowed and/or are still found there because of their persistence, illegal use, deposition from the atmosphere or leaching from landfills/dumps.
A few are still produced in, or used for, other, e.g. industrial, processes.
In groundwater, Member States are obliged to monitor all relevant active substances in pesticides, including their metabolites, degradation and reaction products, and the concentrations have to be compared with quality standards for individual and total pesticides.
The individual and total pesticide quality standards in the Groundwater Directive are also found in the Drinking Water Directive.
Monitoring under that Directive can also provide information on the environmental impact of PPP use.
The Commission is constrained by the statistical legislation in force concerning data confidentiality and aggregation.
The Commission communicated the weaknesses linked the availability of statistics in its report to the European Parliament and the Council60 in 2017.
Immediately after the adoption of the Directive in 2009, efforts were undertaken to develop different indicators.
For example, EU-funded projects such as the project on harmonised environmental indicators for pesticide risk (HAIR) aimed at developing EU-wide indicators to measure the risk and impact of PPP use.
However, these efforts were unsuccessful due to the lack of availability of the required data.
At the early stages of the consultations with the Member States (in a specific Working Group and in the SUD Working Group) some Member States raised concerns regarding the weightings.
However, during the broader consultation through the feedback mechanism no substantive objections were raised and at the moment of voting there was a clear qualified majority for the proposed weightings, with only two Member States voting against.
In the subsequent scrutiny period Council and Parliament did not submit any objections to the proposed weightings.
Substances are no longer approved due to risks to health and/or the environment as identified in a scientific assessment (Member States and EFSA).
The non-approval and subsequent discontinuation of their use contributes objectively to a reduction in risks.
Therefore, a conscious policy decision was made to attribute a high weighting to these substances.
Conclusions and recommendations
The Commission considers that EU action has resulted in risk reduction from PPP use.
Despite a slow start, there was considerable effort by the Commission to improve implementation of Directive 2009/128/EC by Member States.
The Commission has also calculated a 20 % reduction between 2011 and 2017 in the Harmonised Risk Indicator I.
Member State authorities shall ensure that professional users comply with this requirement.
In order to decide on compliance or non-compliance, Member State authorities should have clear assessment criteria.
In line with the subsidiarity principle, converting general principles of IPM into practical criteria is the responsibility of Member States, and the Commission will continue to support Member States in this regard.
The current CAP contributes to the implementation of the Directive.
Cross-compliance, farm advisory systems, greening of direct payments, operational programmes for fruits and vegetables, organic production, agri-environmental and climate measures, investments, support to research, knowledge exchanges and advice, all of which can help in this respect.
As proposed by the Commission, the future CAP will further strengthen this contribution.
The future conditionality will newly cover the relevant provisions of the Directive, including the general principles of IPM, which were identified as fit for this instrument.
Conditionality will raise awareness of farmers to adopt these practices through a risk of reduction of CAP payments.
This will be complemented by supported interventions voluntary for farmers (e.g. eco-schemes, management commitments, etc.), which will be developed by Member States in a consistent way in CAP Plans that will be approved by the Commission.
This has the potential to, where Member States see the need , develop CAP schemes supporting sustainable use of pesticides going beyond the mere legal framework.
Recommendation 1 – Enable IPM enforcement
The Commission accepts recommendation 1 (a).
The Commission partially accepts recommendation 1 (b).
The Commission’s legal proposal for a future CAP includes those general IPM principles corresponding to requirements that are measurable and which can be checked at farm level (see reply to paragraph 34).
However, it is the responsibility of Member States to define on-farm obligations related to conditionality rules on the basis of the EU legislation, including IPM provisions.
The extent to which the Commission will verify the implementation by farmers of these criteria will be further specified in the context of the future CAP.
Recommendation 2 – Improve access to PPP statistics
The Commission accepts recommendations 2a and 2b.
The Commission is exploring the possibilities of improving legislation in this respect.
However, whether legislation will be proposed is not known at the time of this report.
The published Harmonised Risk Indicator I shows a 20 % reduction between 2011 and 2017.
The Commission considers that other relevant data than statistics are needed in order to take into account detailed information about “how, when and where” pesticides are used.
Only data from more targeted monitoring, or research studies, can give these kind of details.
Recommendation 3 – Develop better risk indicators
The Commission partially accepts recommendation 3.
It will take the actions recommended.
However, it considers that achieving the timeline proposed will require Member State agreement to provide the relevant data.
Audit team
The ECA’s special reports set out the results of its audits of EU policies and programmes, or of management-related topics from specific budgetary areas.
The ECA selects and designs these audit tasks to be of maximum impact by considering the risks to performance or compliance, the level of income or spending involved, forthcoming developments and political and public interest.
This performance audit was carried out by Audit Chamber I Sustainable use of natural resources, headed by ECA Member Nikolaos Milionis.
The audit was led by ECA Member Samo Jereb, supported by Kathrine Henderson, Head of Private Office; Robert Markus, Principal Manager; Charlotta Törneling, Head of Task; Päivi Piki, Deputy Head of Task; Greta Kapustaitė, Antonella Stasia, Paulo Oliveira and Dainora Venckevičienė, Auditors.

4 Executive summary I The SME Instrument was set up under the Horizon 2020 research framework programme to support innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Its objective is to develop and capitalise on the potential of SMEs by filling the gap in funding for early stage high-risk projects and increasing private-sector commercialisation of research results.
It is targeted towards innovative SMEs in the EU and 16 associated countries that show strong ambition to develop, grow and internationalise in all different types of innovation.
II With an overall budget of €3 billion for the period 2014-2020, the instrument provides grants to high-potential companies to either support them in developing a feasibility study (up to €50 000 in Phase 1) or in conducting research and development and market-testing (€2.5 million in Phase 2).
Assistance may also be provided through coaching, mentoring or other business acceleration services (Phase 3).
III In this audit, we assessed whether the SME Instrument supports innovation by SMEs.
We examined whether it has targeted the right type of SMEs; if it achieved wide geographic coverage; if the selection process and Commission support were effective, and if the Commission adequately monitored and followed up the instrument, in order to make improvements.
We expect the observations arising from our audit and the recommendations we make to feed into the debate on how to set up and administer the SME instrument’s successor from 2020 onwards.
IV We found that the SME Instrument provides effective support to SMEs in developing their innovation projects and that having the EU branding that comes from receiving EU support helps companies to attract additional investment.
V Nevertheless, the instrument’s broad objectives and targets, together with the changes introduced during the course of its implementation, have caused some uncertainty for stakeholders.
We identified a risk that the instrument funds some SMEs that could have been financed by the market.
VI Participation in the SME Instrument varies markedly between countries.
This is partly due to external factors but also because of the varying levels of support provided by National Contact Points and limitations in the Commission’s marketing and communication activities.
5 VII We found that improvements have been made to evaluation and selection procedures during the lifetime of the instrument, with the oral presentation of project proposals to a panel of jury members being a particularly useful addition in identifying the best proposals.
However, a two-way feedback between the evaluation stages is missing.
In addition, some IT tools are not fit for purpose, thus undermining the process which is already under pressure.
VIII The resubmission of unsuccessful proposals is a large and increasing drain on management and evaluation resources without providing added value.
Not only does it increase administrative costs, it also lowers the success rate, thus discouraging participation.
IX Phase 1 of the instrument provides effective support, thanks to its simple and fast selection process, the EU branding, and access it gives to business acceleration services.
However, it imposes disproportionately high administrative costs on the Commission´s administration and its relevance is diminished in countries where similar programmes already exist.
X Phase 2 of the instrument, which provides a higher level of support with the aim of bringing the innovation to market, enjoys the same positive outcomes as Phase 1 and also helps SMEs in raising additional investment.
XI Nevertheless, we found that the majority of beneficiaries still need additional financing to support their innovative endeavours and bring their projects to market.
The Commission has taken little action to create links between SMEs’ financing needs and EU-backed financial instruments, and its knowledge of beneficiaries’ financial needs is limited.
XII Coaching and business acceleration services have the potential to amplify the effects of the instrument but having been launched late, only a small share of SMEs made use of the services.
Moreover, they have not been sufficiently tailored to the needs of beneficiaries.
XIII Monitoring of investment raised and company evolution is cost-efficient but it does not assess the true impact of the instrument.
Although beneficiaries have managed to raise investments in addition to the grants received, imbalances exist among participating countries, with north-west European SMEs raising more private funding than those in the south and east of Europe.
6 XIV In the report, we recommend that the Commission should: — improve marketing and communication strategy for the instrument;
— improve its support to National Contact Points (NCPs) for SMEs and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN);refine the instrument selection procedure to make better use of resources and fund the best proposals;
— limit the number of times a proposal can be resubmitted and publish the success rate per project proposal;
— propose to Member States that the Commission manages schemes similar to Phase 1;
— preserve a scheme similar to Phase 2 in the next programming period, building on the existing results;
— enhance the business acceleration services by allocating appropriate resources; and
— identify and promote synergies between the SME Instrument and EU backed financial instruments.
7 Introduction
Importance of SMEs and innovation in the EU economy 01 According to the European Commission’s Annual Report on SMEs 2017/2018, SMEs account for 99 % of the companies operating in the EU non-financial business sector, 66 % of total employment and 57 % of value-added in the EU’s non-financial business sector.
02 Both the European Parliament and the Council have stressed the importance of supporting innovation (particularly breakthrough innovation) and the growth of start- ups and SMEs.
They have noted that support to innovative SMEs and start-ups is essential in order to maximise Europe’s potential for growth and socio-economic transformation 1.
Academic studies 2, 3 have demonstrated the relationship between entrepreneurship, SME activity, economic growth and job creation.
03 The Europe 2020 Strategy4 emphasises the importance of innovation in boosting growth and employment in the EU.
“Innovation Union” is one of the Strategy’s seven flagship initiatives, aiming “to create an innovation-friendly environment that makes it easier for great ideas to be turned into products and services that will bring economy growth and jobs” 5.

8 Increased focus on SME and innovation in H2020 04 H2020 is the eighth EU research framework programme.
With a budget of €76.4 billion for the period 2014 to 2020, it ranks as the world’s largest public research and innovation programme 6.
05 H2020 has placed greater emphasis on innovation than any of its predecessors, by providing more funding for testing, prototyping, business-driven R&D and promoting innovative entrepreneurship.
H2020 has also set a more ambitious target in terms of funds to be allocated to SMEs than any other previous framework programme: SMEs should receive a minimum of 20 % of the total combined budget of €9 billion under the pillars “Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies” and “Societal challenges”.
06 A budget of €3 billion has been earmarked for the SME instrument (SME-I), which equates to 33 % of the SME target for the whole H2020 7.
What is the SME Instrument? 07 The SME-I was set up under the Horizon 2020 (H2020) research framework programme (FWP) to support innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It provides grants to high-potential companies to support them in developing a feasibility study (Phase 1) and in conducting research and development (R&D) and market-testing (Phase 2).
Assistance may also be provided through coaching, mentoring or other business acceleration services (Phase 3).
Available to SMEs in Member States and countries that have signed association agreements (associated countries) 8, the SME-I aims to help companies scale up and internationalise.
08 The SME-I is a novel instrument, since it allows SMEs to participate as single beneficiaries without necessarily being part of a consortium as usually required by research framework programmes.
It targets projects having reached at least technology readiness level 6.

9 09 The objective of the SME-I is to develop and capitalise on the potential of SMEs by filling the gap in funding for early stage high-risk research and innovation, and increasing private-sector commercialisation of research results.
It is targeted at SMEs showing a strong ambition to grow and internationalise and shall be provided for all types of innovation where each activity has a clear European added value.
10 Responsibility for policy development with respect to the SME-I lies with the European Commission’s DG Research and Innovation (DG RTD), while implementation is carried out by the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME).
11 The instrument comprises three phases (see Figure 1): — Phase 1 (investigation of technical and commercial feasibility of a business idea): exploring the scientific or technical feasibility and commercial potential of new ideas.
Grants of €50 000 are awarded with a 70 % co- financing rate from the EU.
— Phase 2 (development and demonstration): developing innovation for the purposes of demonstration, performance verification, testing, the development of pilot lines, validation for market replication, and other activities aimed at bringing innovation to investment readiness and maturity for market take-up.
Grants of up to €2.5 million can be awarded with a 70 % co-financing rate.
— Phase 3 (additional EU support to enter the market): providing support, training and coaching, as well as facilitating access to risk finance.
This phase consists of a bundle of services offered to beneficiaries in Phases 1 and 2.
No additional grants are awarded in this phase.
12 Although the different phases are numbered, the SME-I is not sequential: there is no need to complete Phase 1 in order to participate in Phase 2.
The services offered in Phase 3 may be provided at any point during implementation of the innovation project, or even after finalisation.

A short history of the SME Instrument 13 The SME Instrument was launched in 2014, with a design based on the USA’s SBIR 9 programme.
Its “funnel model” would make a large number of low-level investments in feasibility studies for promising innovation projects (Phase 1), with the best progressing to Phase 2 and an increased level of funding.
However, the obligation to pass through Phase 1 before Phase 2 was removed at the design phase, allowing applicants to directly apply to either.
14 As for other parts of Horizon 2020, the SME Instrument is implemented via work programmes, which cover periods of two or three years, and with each work programme, the characteristics of the instrument can be modified according to policy intentions.
15 The 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 work programmes divided the SME-I budget into thematic topics e.g. biotechnology, health, security.
SMEs would apply to the topic, which fitted their project best.
9 https://www.sbir.gov/about/about-sbir.
11 16 The 2018-2020 work programme featured a “European Innovation Council (EIC) Pilot” which grouped the SME-I together with certain other programmes – Future Emerging Technologies Open (FET Open), Fast Track to Innovation (FTI) and H2020 Prizes.
The main changes introduced under the EIC Pilot affecting the SME-I were:
o a bottom-up approach in an open call without needing to apply to a thematic topic;
o a “pitch” by SMEs for selection in Phase 2: face-to-face interviews with a panel of experienced innovators;
o increased mentoring and coaching opportunities for all beneficiaries through Phase 3.
17 In June 2018, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation establishing Horizon Europe post-2020 10.
The proposal envisages an EIC as the third pillar in a framework programme with a budget of €10.5 billion that would “combine all EU support to breakthrough and market-creating innovation in one place” and comprise two instruments: the Pathfinder for Advanced Research and the Accelerator.
Therefore, the previous Phase 1 would definitively be discontinued while actions similar to those in the previous Phases 2 and 3 would be included in the Accelerator 11.
10 COM(2018) 435, Proposal for a Regulation establishing Horizon Europe, June 2018.
11 In April 2019 the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council reached a provisional general agreement on Horizon Europe.
12 18 In March 2019, the Commission modified the work programme and launched the “Enhanced EIC Pilot” to run from June 2019 to the end of 2020.
The Enhanced EIC Pilot represents a transition towards the proposed EIC under Horizon Europe (post-2020), forging a closer relationship between the constituent parts and bringing significant changes to the SME-I.
Phase 1 was discontinued and the following instruments were introduced:
o the “Pathfinder”, replacing the former FET-Open and FET-Proactive;
o the “Accelerator”, replacing the previous Phase 2:
— development and scaling-up of high-risk innovation by SMEs;
— introduction of the non-bankability concept 12;
— grants of up to €2.5 million; and
— option for equity injection of up to €15 million (blended finance).
19 The EIC Pilot represented an evolution of the SME-I, mostly in line with its original design, while the Enhanced EIC Pilot introduced changes facilitating a transition towards the proposed EIC under Horizon Europe.
The SME-I is the largest element in both the EIC Pilot and EIC Enhanced Pilot, accounting for around two-thirds of the respective budgets.
20 The proposal for the EIC under Horizon Europe, currently in legislative procedure, preserves some elements of the instrument such as a continued focus on SMEs and grant-only support.
However, certain other aspects under consideration have yet to be developed or tested 13.
12 The concept of non-bankability is defined in the EIC frequent asked questions as an “inability to attract sufficient funding”.
13 For example, the provision of financial support to projects through equity finance, and the partial acceptance of the selection processes carried out in other calls or programmes.
13 Audit scope and approach 21 This special report is the latest in a series of ECA publications examining financial support to innovative SMEs 14.
Both the European Parliament and the Council have stressed the importance of supporting innovative SMEs and start-ups in order to maximise Europe’s potential for growth.
We expect the observations arising from our audit and the recommendations we make to feed into the multiannual financial framework debate on how to set up and administer the SME instrument’s successor from 2020 onwards.
22 In this audit, we examined whether the SME Instrument was effective in supporting innovation by SMEs?
23 The audit addressed whether: o the instrument targeted the “right SMEs”(i.e., those with high innovation potential);
o the instrument achieved geographical reach as well as searching for excellence;
o the Commission’s selection process was designed to fund the best projects;
o the Commission provided effective support to beneficiaries;
o the Commission adequately monitored and followed up the instrument in order to make improvements.
24 Our audit therefore focused on the design, management and outputs of the SME- I and its evolution towards the EIC including the EIC Pilot.
We included in our audit the grants awarded in the period January 2014 to May 2019.
14 Special reports on guarantees (SR 20/2017 SME Guarantee Facility) and on venture capital (SR 17/2019).
14 25 The audit combined evidence from a range of sources: o a desk review of documents;
o an analytical data review;
o surveys of beneficiaries, unsuccessful applicants receiving a seal of excellence, remote evaluators and national innovation agencies (NIAs);
o information visits to Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom; and
o interviews with Commission Directorates-General, EASME, the European Investment Bank (EIB), European Investment Fund (EIF) and other relevant stakeholders.
26 For further details on our audit methodology and sources of evidence, see Annex I.
15 Observations
Targeting the right beneficiaries 27 According to the H2020 Regulation15, the SME-I targets innovative SMEs with a strong ambition to develop, grow and internationalise.
Objectives and target group of the SME Instrument have changed during its implementation
28 SME-I stakeholders pointed out in interviews and in response to our surveys that the SME-I would have benefited from a more precise definition of its target and objectives at its inception.
29 This ambiguity, particularly concerning the type of companies being targeted by the SME-I, was also highlighted in the SME Experts Advisory Group (EAG) 2014 Report 16.
According to the EAG, additional resources and a deeper analysis of the intended target group would have allowed the Commission greater confidence in attracting the right type of applicants.
30 The objectives in successive work programmes changed several times throughout implementation.
The first two work programmes (2014-2015 and 2016-2017) focused on any innovation that boosted company growth and was new to the market.
The work programmes for the EIC Pilot (2018-2020) and the Enhanced EIC Pilot (2019- 2020) shifted focus towards “market-creating” innovation.
By comparison, the SBIR programme has changed little since its renewal in 2011 17.
31 The frequent changes introduced during the short life of the SME-I has led to confusion for key actors, such as the National Contact Points (NCPs), the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) and applicants about what should be funded.

16 32 During implementation of the SME-I, the type of companies targeted has shifted from mature companies that had participated in previous FWPs, to innovative and in particular, young companies without previous FWP experience.
The introduction in 2018 of the bottom-up approach and the pitch under the EIC Pilot accelerated the move towards a more youthful mix of SMEs (see Figure 2).

33 The current age profile of beneficiaries matches that of companies identified in the Nesta study18 on the factors for growth and differences in job creation for companies.
This indicates that the current portfolio of beneficiaries is better positioned to deliver growth and job creation.
34 The bottom-up approach has solved the issue seen with the previous structure where companies would select the "topic" on which to apply for support, based on the different award success rates.
It has also simplified the administrative procedures for the calls.
An alternative approach may be appropriate where there is a need to ring- fence specific areas considered a priority for the EU.

17 Late introduction of non-bankability concept
35 The SME-I aims to “fill the gap in funding for early stage high-risk research and innovation” 19.
However, the successive work programmes have not specified how to target SMEs facing difficulties in obtaining funding from other sources, and the concept of “non-bankability” was only introduced with the Enhanced EIC Pilot in 2019.
36 According to various stakeholders interviewed, there is a risk of the SME-I crowding-out private investment.
This was borne out in the results of our survey among beneficiaries.
In Phase 2, 36 % of respondents believed that their projects could have received funding from the private sector, and 17 % replied that they could have used their company's own resources to fund innovation.
Jury members also confirmed this risk in interview (see Figure 3).

37 However, the stakeholders highlighted the subsequent crowding-in effect generated by the EU grant that helps beneficiaries to later attract the additional funds needed to advance their innovation projects and scale up.
38 The bankability of a project is a complex concept determined by several variables, such as volume of funds needed, timing and price.
Given its complexity, most interviewees believed there was a need to define what bankability meant and how it should be measured.
19 Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 establishing H2020.
18 39 Prior to 2019, the bankability of projects was not considered in the SME-I selection process.
Indeed the instrument awarded grants to some SMEs that could have been financed by the market.
The introduction of the non-bankability concept requires clear provisions on how it can be demonstrated, particularly since the EU branding of the SME-I and the grant itself attract additional financial resources supporting beneficiaries’ innovation projects.
Geographical reach
Varying levels of participation among countries – partly due to factors beyond the control of the Commission
40 The main factor determining SME-I participation and project success is excellence.
Therefore, given the contrasting innovation levels among Member States, an uneven distribution of funds is to be expected.
At the same time, however, through H2020 the EU aims to ensure that the benefits of an innovation-led economy are widely distributed and maximised 20.
41 The graphs and maps below (Figure 4, Picture 1 and Picture 2) illustrate country- level statistics on the number of submitted applications and funding received relative to the number of SMEs, GDP and population.
Annex II shows the distribution of SME-I funding per Member State in absolute and relative terms, the number of projects awarded, the number of proposals and the success rate per Member State.
42 Traditionally, Horizon 2020 implementation analysis has featured two different groups of Member States: EU-15 and EU-13 21.
In the case of the SME Instrument, this distinction does not serve to explain the variation in funding received (see first column of Figure 4).

21 EU-13 Member States are meant as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, whereas EU-15 countries are the other 15 Member States of the European Union.

21 43 The level of participation in SME-I and project success rate are affected by several factors:
(1) innovation ecosystem and number of SMEs in the country;
(2) existence of a national strategy on the SME-I;
(3) effort made to promote the SME-I; and
(4) support provided by NCPs and the EEN.
44 While some of these factors are beyond the Commission’s control, others – such as the marketing and promotion of the instrument or the support provided by the NCPs – fall within its influence.
45 Differences in success rates between countries are partly explained by existing variation in the levels of innovation.

22 46 A common characteristic of participant countries with high participation and success rates in the instrument is the presence of an active national innovation agency (NIA), which acts as intermediary with the innovative SMEs.
Conversely, in the three Member States with the lowest level of participation (compared to the number of SMEs in the country) and the lowest success rates, there is no NIA.
47 In our survey of national innovation agencies (NIAs), we asked whether they had national programmes supporting SMEs in applying for the SME-I.
Just under half of NIAs confirmed that they had national programmes supporting SMEs applying for Phase 2, with 35 % reporting this for Phase 1 (see Figure 6).
Interviewees noted that since the SME-I instrument was created, some national agencies had scaled down similar programmes and instead prepared their companies for SME-I.

48 Spain is a good example of a Member State with a national strategy supporting innovative companies that could be eligible for the SME-I.
The Spanish authorities have set up a system to market the SME-I, actively searching for highly innovative companies and supporting them in applying for the instrument.
Spain is the greatest beneficiary of the SME-I: it receives some 20 % of the total budget and has the highest number of applicant SMEs.
Despite being a moderate innovator according to the European Innovation Scoreboard, it has one of the highest success rates.
Ireland and Denmark also actively promote the instrument and prepare their SMEs for participation.
23 49 In Member States visited with a low level of participation in the SME-I (in terms of funds awarded and success rate), awareness of the SME-I was limited.
There was little specific support or promotion at national level or guidance for companies regarding the instrument.
In turn, low success rates have discouraged other companies from applying to the SME-I.
Moreover, the existence of alternative national programmes, which return higher success rates, has reduced the attractiveness of the SME-I for companies and auxiliary agents such as consultants.
Awareness affected by the absence of a targeted marketing and communication strategy at Commission level
50 The SME-I represents a new form of support in the FWPs, targeting mainly single SMEs with highly innovative projects, with a market-driven approach.
51 The traditional types of H2020 applicant (universities, large corporations and research centres) is familiar with the funding opportunities offered by H2020.
These organisations have experience with both H2020 and previous FWPs and, in many cases, have dedicated staff managing applications and projects.
The type of companies targeted by the SME-I generally have not participated in previous FWPs and may not even have included public funds in their finance strategy.
52 We examined whether SME-I was promoted, implemented and monitored to provide easy access to the instrument for SMEs as set out in Council Decision 743/2013.
We also looked at the extent to which marketing techniques were used to make the right companies aware that this funding opportunity exists and appropriate channels of communication must be identified and used to reach them.
53 The Commission and EASME had a limited budget to launch communication activities and organise various events gathering potential beneficiaries of the SME-I, mainly H2020 information days.
Reports published by the EAG highlighted the absence of a marketing strategy for the SME-I, and the need to identify the right “clients” and adjust communication channels and tools accordingly.
The SME-I evaluation 23 saw this as a possible explanation for varying penetration rates in the EU-28 countries, and pointed to the need to re-examine the communication and marketing strategy.
23 “Evaluation of the SME instrument and the activities under Horizon 2020 Work Programme Innovation in SMEs”, February 2017.
24 54 Despite the efforts made to reach potential beneficiaries, the Commission did not have a structured marketing and communication strategy.
It did not employ a sufficiently targeted approach to raise awareness among innovative SMEs of the funding opportunities offered by the SME-I.
55 The Commission relies heavily on the promotion done at national level by the NCPs and the EEN to achieve uniform implementation of the SME-I.
It considers the NCPs to be “the main structure for providing practical information and assistance to potential participants”.
As SMEs are less familiar with H2020 than other participants in the FWP (see paragraph 51), the role of the NCPs is particularly important for SMEs.
The NCPs are appointed and paid by the national authorities.
They are responsible for ensuring that “the new programme becomes known and readily accessible to all potential applicants” 24.
However, as stated in the ECA special report 28/2018 25, the level of support offered by the NCPs varies among Member States.
In some, they act as full-time NCPs; in others, they have to combine NCP tasks with other responsibilities.
56 The level of support provided by the NCPs varies across Member States, influencing the level of participation and success rates.
In only two of the six Member States visited were the NCPs fully dedicated to the role.
The NCPs in two Member States held proposal-writing workshops and pre-screened applications.
One organised mock jury pitches.
Others did little, aside from hosting H2020 information days.
57 The NCPs and EEN reported that the SME-I had been promoted mainly at national level with limited support from the European Commission, as the programme does not allocate the NCPs a specific budget for dissemination activities.
24 http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/support/ncp/h2020-standards- principles_en.pdf.
25 Special report 28/2018 The majority of simplification measures brought into Horizon 2020 have made life easier for beneficiaries, but opportunities to improve still exist.
25 58 Access4SMEs is an H2020 coordination and support action aiming to “facilitate transnational cooperation among NCPs for SMEs and access to risk finance, upgrade their skills and tools in order to raise their standard of support” 26.
Interviewees stated that Access4SMEs has been the main source of information on the SME-I for the NCPs, EENs and beneficiaries.
However, the network was only set up in September 2016 – almost three years after the launch of the instrument – and so was not in place when its services would have been the most valuable.
Selection of projects 59 An effective selection procedure is critical to ensuring that the best applications are chosen for funding.
In view of this, the selection procedure should have sufficient resources and assign the appropriate type of experts to each stage of the evaluation.
60 The SME Instrument is based on a continuously open call for proposals, with four cut-off dates per phase per year.
The evaluation process is carried out remotely by four independent evaluators per proposal.
Since 2018, the selection procedure for Phase 2 grants has included a presentation of the projects to a jury, which is a second stage of evaluation conducted by a panel of six experts, mostly investors.
Limited resources for evaluation and remote evaluation procedure overloaded by high number of submissions
61 EASME receives and manages a very high number of proposals at each of the four cut-off dates per year for each of the two phases.
At the last cut-off date for 2018, it received more than 1800 applications for Phase 2 and 2200 for Phase 1.
62 The evaluation process is challenged by a combination of limited resources and a high number of submissions.
Evaluators have only 1.6 hours in Phase 1 and 2.4 hours in Phase 2 to complete the evaluation and its documentation, although applications are lengthy (10 pages excluding annexes for Phase 1 and 30 pages excluding annexes for Phase 2).
26 http://www.access4smes.eu/project/#_goal
26 63 In our survey, only 34 % of Phase 2 evaluators responded that the 2.4 hours allocated by the Commission to evaluate the proposals was sufficient.
The average time needed was 5.1 hours.
For Phase 1, 56 % of respondents were satisfied, requiring three hours instead of 1.6 hours allocated by the Commission (see Figure 7).

Source: ECA survey to evaluators.
64 The evaluators replying to our survey were mostly satisfied with the guidance and training provided, though they would like to receive feedback on their evaluations and statistics of outcomes, enabling them to benchmark and improve their performance.
They expressed concern about the training for new evaluators and the consequent variability in their scoring.
Statistics from EASME confirm this variability and H2020 rules require that 25 % of evaluators are newcomers.
Presentation to jury largely improves the selection procedure while complying with time-to-grant
65 The introduction of the presentation of projects to a jury in 2018 was a positive change, since it compensates for the weaknesses inherent in a remote evaluation and allows for the verification of the practicality of the project and the potential of the team to implement it.
Nevertheless, certain elements remain sub-optimal.
66 The jury members assess 20 presentation of projects during an evaluation week and are expected to read the documents submitted by applicants in advance.
However, the jury members we interviewed felt that they did not receive the documents sufficiently in advance to review potentially 1 600 pages of application information.
27 67 They also suggested having access to the comments from the remote evaluators’ reports.
In doing so, useful knowledge would be retained, thereby improving efficiency, given the limited time available for preparing and discussing the presentation of projects to the juries.
Similarly, evaluators considered that the quality of their evaluations would be improved if they received the jury members’ comments on the proposals they had evaluated.
68 No systematic due diligence is currently performed on applications reaching the presentation stage.
Jury members indicated the need for a “light” due diligence process to verify the accuracy of the information provided by applicants on patents, company profile and team composition.
69 The Commission set the time-to-grant (time between the cut-off date and the signature of the grant agreement) target at a maximum of three months for Phase 1 and six months for Phase 2.
Actual time-to-grant has decreased since the start of the programme and despite the introduction of the presentation to juries in 2018, in that year EASME signed 90 % of the grants within the target time.
Some IT tools pose risks for the evaluation process
70 Applicants submit proposals online via the electronic proposal submission system on the H2020 Participant Portal.
71 To arrange presentations of projects and compose juries with suitable skills, EASME uses a spreadsheet workbook, which is vulnerable to breakdown that could cause delays and jeopardise an evaluation procedure.
72 Since there are no dedicated IT tools to reimburse applicants for their participation in the pitch, they are registered as evaluators in the internal expert management system (EMI).
Consequently, there is a risk that they could accidentally be contacted for the purpose of evaluating proposals.
73 In addition, changes in the selection process introduced in September 2019 under the Enhanced EIC pilot (request for financial data from participants and technology readiness level information) require bolt-on solutions that have not yet been developed.
28 Resubmission of proposals straining evaluation resources
74 There is no limit to the number of times that an unsuccessful application can be resubmitted to the SME-I.
At evaluation, a resubmitted proposal receives the same treatment as any other initial application, with no information from previous evaluations being carried forward.
75 The additional cost to the applicant of resubmitting an unchanged proposal is negligible.
The number of resubmitted applications has been steadily increasing and now forms a sizeable proportion of total submissions.
For the latest 2018 Phase 2 cut- offs (see Figure 8), 66 % of applications were resubmissions, with half of these appearing for at least the third time.

76 The increase of applications over time is only due to the resubmissions.
The number of new projects applying for Phase 2 has remained stable at 500 applications per cut-off (see Figure 9).

Source: ECA based on Commission data.
77 Resubmissions place a significant and increasing strain on evaluation resources.
Between 2015 and 2018, the cost of evaluating proposals on their third and subsequent resubmission – considering only remote expert evaluators’ fees – was over €4.3 million (including more than €1.8 million in 2018).
78 The H2020 mid-term evaluation suggested that oversubscription discouraged participation, impaired the quality of evaluations, was a drain on resources and left a number of high-quality proposals unfunded.
79 The average success rate for SME-I submissions is 4.7 % in Phase 2 and 8.6 % in Phase 1.
However, if we calculate the success rate per project proposal rather than per submission, around 11.5 % of Phase 2 and 16.6 % of Phase 1 proposals are ultimately successful.
30 Effectiveness of support in the SME Instrument phases 80 Support provided by the SME-I should be timely and relevant and meet the needs of innovative SMEs.
Phase 1 provides useful support to SMEs but similar schemes already exist in some Member States
81 According to interviewed stakeholders, Phase 1 and Phase 2 have effectively become two different programmes.
Phase 1 helps companies with no public funding experience, such as small IT companies or start-ups; Phase 2 is more complex, which means the type of companies applying for Phase 1 find applying for Phase 2 a challenge.
82 The difference in success rates between companies passing through Phase 1 before applying to Phase 2 and companies applying directly to Phase 2 has been narrowing throughout SME-I implementation.
However, the Phase 2 success rate is still 50 % higher for companies passing through Phase 1 than for companies applying directly to Phase 2 (see Figure 10).

83 Phase 2 beneficiaries that had passed through Phase 1 indicated that the first phase had provided good preparation, helping them to improve the project.
31 84 Stakeholders interviewed in some Member States believed that Phase 1 projects could often be carried out just as well at national level, although this would be a challenge in some Member States.
85 In our survey of the NIAs, 48 % of respondents declared that their Member State had national programmes similar to Phase 1.
When asked about the main strengths of SME-I Phase 1 compared with national programmes, the NIAs cited the fast and transparent selection procedure, the credibility conferred by the EU label, and access to coaching and business acceleration services.
In addition, they praised the critical mass of innovative companies that had been set up thanks to SME-I Phase 1, which had managed to attract many innovative companies to the EU programme.
86 When asked for their views on continuing Phase 1 under the new FWP, 86 % of NIA respondents considered that Phase 1 should be preserved under the new FWP (see Box 1 for examples of opinions of NIAs on whether to continue with funding for Phase 1).
Those in favour of continuing Phase 1, indicated that the business acceleration and coaching services had increased these companies’ capacity to handle innovation activities in a professional way, allowing them to scale up and grow.
They suggested that the European nature of the call for proposals spurred SMEs to raise their level of ambition from the early development stages, and that the simple and fast evaluation process had no equivalent at national level.
Those against continuing Phase 1, (14 %) noted the absence of added value over national/regional instruments and the absence of a significant link between Phases 1 and 2.
32 Box 1
National Innovation Agencies opinions on Phase 1 — “Phase 1 has been an excellent entry point to Horizon 2020 for SMEs with no prior experience of European or International programmes for R&I. The mentoring and coaching activities provided by EEN to SME I beneficiaries have increased these companies’ capacity to handle innovation activities in a professional way, allowing them to scale and grow.”
— “Phase 1 has enabled SMEs to take one step further.
SMEs themselves often lack knowledge and resources to make exhaustive IP, market and competition surveys, etc.
After finalisation of the Phase 1 project, they are also well prepared, not only to apply for Phase 2 funding but also for other funding resources/capital.
The grant received from the EC is also kind of a trust and quality label.”
— “Phase 1 is valuable, but does not add the most benefit.
Rather it is important that MSs/Associated Countries also invest themselves, so that small-scale interventions such as this could be left to national/regional agencies.
However, not all MSs are equipped at present to deliver such support.”
— “Phase 1 provides no additionality; any MS can set up a similar programme.”
Phase 1 imposes an excessive burden on SME Instrument administration
87 Since the launch of the SME-I, 3 978 Phase 1 grant agreements have been signed.
The process from start to finish requires a considerable administrative effort in terms of evaluation, grant preparation, grant signature and coaching services.
Four project officers manage around 1 000 projects per year.
Project monitoring is therefore limited to administrative checks, without an assessment of the quality of the feasibility study.
88 Table 1 compares the costs of remote evaluation per phase with the overall amount granted.
It highlights a large difference in the costs of each phase, with the relative evaluation costs being ten times greater (per euro granted) in Phase 1 than in Phase 2.
The benchmark for the cost of evaluation in the private venture capital sector is 3 %.

89 Despite the greater administrative overhead incurred for Phase 1 compared to Phase 2, Phase 1 provides effective support, thanks to the fast selection process at EU level, the EU label for beneficiaries and the access to the BAS.
In addition, it has attracted many innovative companies to the EU programme.
However, in countries where similar programmes to Phase 1 already exist, its relevance is diminished.
90 The Commission has discontinued Phase 1 from September 2019.
34 Phase 2 provides effective support to SMEs
91 Interviewed stakeholders (representatives from the NIAs and NCPs, innovation experts, evaluators, jury members, the EEN, SME umbrella organisations and beneficiaries) were unanimous in their endorsement of Phase 2 on account of its many positive elements, such as:
— the intensity of financial support at a high technology readiness level that Member States cannot provide 27;
— competition among SMEs at EU level;
— attraction of additional investment through association with the EU brand (see paragraphs 119 and 121);
— availability of coaching and business acceleration services;
— simple and fast selection and award processes compared to national schemes; and
— focus on the “go-to-market” strategy of the projects, in which projects develop an action plan specifying how the SME will reach customers and achieve competitive advantage.
92 In our survey to the NIAs, we asked whether they thought that SME-I Phase 2 should continue under Horizon Europe and why (see Box 2 for examples of opinions of NIAs on whether to continue with funding for Phase 2).
All respondents said that it should continue.
27 Commission Regulation No 651/2014 declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market.
35 Box 2
National Innovation Agencies opinions on Phase 2 — It offers something different from what is available at the national level; in addition, it facilitates the creation of international networks.
Coaching is also important.
— It is a great instrument that is easy to understand for the applicants.
— It is an important and unique programme to support growing SMEs in the pilot phase.
— The success and popularity of the scheme amongst SMEs has proved that it has a very suitable setup for SMEs.
The changes made during the implementation period (especially interviews) have raised the value of the scheme.
93 When asked if significant changes should be made to the design of the SME-I, 75 % replied “no”, 16 % indicated limited changes and only 11 % more profound changes.
This suggests that Phase 2’s current form is generally well appreciated.
94 Phase 2 of the SME-I provides effective support to beneficiaries.
It provides EU branding that gives visibility to the companies and projects, helps them to raise additional investment, and allows access to the EU network of coaching and BAS.
Phase 2 enjoys a very high appreciation in its current form among surveyed NIAs.
This opinion is shared by all stakeholders interviewed.
Phase 3 business acceleration services have potential but were launched late
95 The coaching and business acceleration services (Phase 3) play a key role in the overall setup of the SME-I, as they should respond to SMEs’ innovation needs through tailor-made support, competence development and networking.
According to a study published by the University of Manchester, there is “a far greater level of success for firms (particularly small firms) in measures that combine direct and indirect support” 28.
28 “The Impact of Direct Support to R&D and Innovation in Firms”, Compendium of Evidence on the Effectiveness of Innovation Policy Intervention, August 2012.
36 96 Coaching covers a broad range of topics, notably: business development, organisational development, cooperation and financing.
Phase 1 beneficiaries receive three days’ coaching and Phase 2 beneficiaries receive 12.
The SME-I has led to the set- up of the first European network of coaches to support beneficiaries.
97 Business acceleration services are open to both Phase 1 and Phase 2 beneficiaries and include participation in:
— trade fairs and conferences;
— corporate days;
— investors’ events;
— the EIC Innovators' summit;
— mentoring;
— the EIC Community Platform;
— an investors' matching tool;
— the EIC Academy.
98 Phase 3 events and other business acceleration services have focused primarily on putting SMEs in contact with potential investors or business partners.
EASME has done little to help beneficiaries in reaching out to potential customers (both large private corporates and public bodies through innovative public procurement).
99 SME beneficiaries responding to our survey very much appreciated both the coaching scheme and any business acceleration services that they had used (see Figure 11).
This positive opinion was confirmed by our visits to beneficiaries and the surveyed NIAs.
Nevertheless, the NIAs and EEN nodes suggested that EASME could:
— better coordinate the organisation of events with local players (NIAs and EEN nodes);
— better target the marketing of business acceleration services to avoid emailing SMEs about events that were not relevant to them;
— explore opportunities to collaborate with national promotional institutions that could provide investment opportunities to SME-I beneficiaries.

100 Interviewed innovation experts take the view that business acceleration services should stimulate the demand-side through matching SMEs with potential large business customers and supporting their participation in innovative public procurement schemes.
101 In comparison, Phase 3 of the SBIR programme is oriented towards public procurement.
In the United States, federal agencies with annual R&D budgets exceeding $100 million are required to allocate 3.2 % to beneficiaries of the SBIR programme in the form of public procurement.
In 2015, the contracts signed between US federal agencies and SBIR beneficiaries amounted to $1.3 billion, while grants overall were worth $1.2 billion 29.

In this document it indicates that “by acting as a lead customer, public buyers can provide innovative companies with an opportunity to test their new solutions under real-life conditions.
Moreover, by becoming their customer and thus increasing their turnover, contracting authorities might encourage other investors – both public and private – to invest in their activities”.
However, at present, the Commission has not included any innovative public procurement schemes among the business acceleration services to link the SME-I beneficiaries to EU agencies or national institutions.
103 Uptake of the various business acceleration services has been low, with attendance among the surveyed beneficiaries ranging from 12 % at the EIC Academy to 40 % at trade fairs and conferences (see Figure 12).
This is partly explained by the fact that some services only started at the end of 2017, almost four years after the launch of the instrument.

Effectiveness of the SME Instrument not assessed and its future role in Horizon Europe is still to be determined
104 In order to provide timely input to the drafting of the new regulation, the Commission performed several evaluations in the early years of the SME-I – despite the lack of mature data (see Figure 13) – such as:
— the mid-term evaluation of the SME-I published in February 2017, by which point, no Phase 2 innovation project had yet been completed;
— the H2020 mid-term evaluation published in May 2017, affected by the same constraints as in the point above;
— the Horizon Europe Impact Assessment published in June 2018.
Only around 200 companies had at this point completed their Phase 2 innovation projects.
Furthermore, it normally takes a few years to see the real impact of the innovation project.

105 Due to the novelty of the programme and the absence of any previous track record, the SME-I was evaluated purely on the basis of inputs and completed Phase 1 projects, and not on the basis of results from Phase 2 projects.
Consultations conducted and independent reports produced for the design of the EIC under Horizon Europe (see Annex II) were similarly affected.
Therefore, the Commission could not base the design of the EIC under Horizon Europe on a comprehensive analysis of the SME-I’s implementation, achieved results and impact.
41 Attracting investment after SME Instrument funding 106 One of the SME-I’s objectives is to facilitate access to private capital and create links to EU-backed financial instruments31.
According to Council Decision 743/2013, “links to the financial instruments […] are foreseen, for example, by giving SMEs that have successfully completed phases 1 and/or 2, priority within a ring-fenced volume of financial resources”.
Commission has only limited knowledge of beneficiaries´ overall financing needs and has not made link to EU financial instruments
107 EASME does not systematically collect information on Phase 2 beneficiaries’ additional financial needs for full development of their projects.
EASME last carried out a survey in 2016 to assess these needs but posed no questions on the preferred source or intended use of funding.
108 In 2018, DG RTD asked the EIB to produce a study on access to finance for SME-I beneficiaries, which was then used to support the Horizon Europe Impact Assessment 32.
The EIB based the report on prior assessments and on a survey conducted on a sample of beneficiaries.
However, the sample was not representative and only 24 beneficiaries responded to the survey.
Consequently, the report provides only limited insight into the actual financial needs of SME-I beneficiaries.
109 Our representative survey (see Annex I) provided some indication of the financial needs of Phase 2 beneficiaries.
In particular:
— three quarters of respondents said they needed additional financing of an average of €7.1 million;
— 70 % of respondents seeking additional financing expressed an interest in private venture capital investment, while 48 % were open to debt instruments such as loans or credit lines.
110 The type of financing sought varies according to company maturity with young SMEs more interested in equity injections than older ones (see Figure 14).

111 The majority of SME-I beneficiaries would need additional financing to support their innovation endeavours and bring their innovation projects to market.
However, the Commission’s knowledge of beneficiaries’ financial needs is limited.
112 Under the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, the EU launched a large range of financial instruments to support innovation by SMEs33.
However, 64 % of beneficiary survey respondents were not aware of these instruments.
113 The EIB report on access to finance for beneficiaries of the SME-I34 drew the following conclusions, which were confirmed through our survey and interviews with beneficiaries:
— There is a funding gap for SME-I beneficiaries when projects exit Phase 2.
— Grants provide a positive market signal to private capital providers.
— Available information on financial instruments is fragmented and communication between private and public capital providers is limited.
33 Among others: “Access to risk finance initiative” (InnovFin) under H2020; “Access to finance for SMEs” (COSME); European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).
34 EIB-Innovfin Advisory Group: “Improving Access to Finance for Beneficiaries of the SME-I” (March 2018).
43 114 An EAG report35 in 2016, pointed to the lack of synergies between different EU financial interventions and the need for the SME-I to coordinate with other public investors, to better meet projects’ demands for funds following Phase 2 completion.
115 We analysed the list of beneficiaries of EU-backed venture capital managed by the EIB and the EIF and found that, by the end of 2018, only 16 SME-I beneficiaries (eight of which were Phase 2) had received such financial support.
In five cases, the financial instrument’s investment occurred before the SME-I grant had been awarded.
116 One of the SME-I’s aims since inception has been to create links with EU- backed financial instruments.
However, the Commission has taken very little action to this end: it did not ring-fence any funds for SME-I beneficiaries and beneficiaries have limited awareness of the EU-backed financial instruments.

44 Beneficiaries attract further investment but levels vary across EU
117 SME-I grant agreements do not impose reporting obligations on beneficiaries following completion of the project.
Instead, EASME monitors beneficiaries’ evolution after finalisation of the SME-I grant through two database sources managed by external contractors:
— Source 1: is used to assess investment raised by SME-I beneficiaries.
The database is populated through collecting information on investment rounds which is publicly available on-line.
To assess the reliability of this source, we carried out checks on a random sample of 30 Phase 2 beneficiaries, which corroborated the figures obtained from information available on-line.
— Source 2: is used to assess the evolution over time of SME-I beneficiaries’ performance in terms of turnover, net income, cash flow and employment levels.
118 Information collected directly from beneficiaries may be less reliable due to self-reporting bias.
In addition, the use of third-party information is more cost- efficient.
At the same time, both sources of information used are incomplete, since:
— Source 1 underestimates the actual investment raised by SME-I beneficiaries, due to the unknown quantity of investment in the form of debt and equity injections that are not published on-line.
— Source 2 provides complete information for approximately only 60 % of all SME-I beneficiaries36.
119 According to the information available on-line, the investment-to-grant ratio is 2.9 for Phase 2 beneficiaries that received an SME-I grant in 2014 and 2015 and exited their innovation projects in 2017.
Figure 15 shows the evolution in additional investment raised by beneficiaries in the years following the granting of SME-I support.
36 Source: EASME.

1 000 800 Million EUR 600
400 200 - 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years 5 years Source: ECA based on EASME data.
120 These figures do not include investment rounds that are not disclosed online, such as most of smaller equity injections and nearly all debt capital provided by banks, funds and other financial players.
Investments raised by only 11 % of Phase 2 beneficiaries are publicly available on-line.
121 In comparison, the majority of Phase 2 beneficiaries (78 % of respondents to our survey) declared that Phase 2 funding had helped them leverage further funding to support their innovation needs.
Hence, beneficiaries’ actual capacity to attract investment is presumably higher than that inferred from information available on-line.
122 According to third-party (source 1 see paragraph 117) information confirmed by data collected in project reporting, SME-I beneficiaries show positive trends in structural growth, with approximately 75 % of the companies having seen their operating revenue grow since applying for the grant and 67 % increasing their headcount.
123 A comprehensive set of impact metrics based on reliable data, combined with complete automated profiling of the companies submitting project proposals and selected for a grant, is necessary to develop an effective business intelligence strategy.
This could help:
— identify participation patterns and potential imbalances;
— link impact metrics with clusters of participants, providing valuable information on how to maximise the overall impact of the instrument.
46 124 The SME-I under the Enhanced EIC Pilot has introduced improvements in terms of company profiling, since the new administrative forms collect data on previous rounds of investment, financial data and ownership structure of the proposers.
However, to date information has not been systematically collected at proposal submission stage on the gender of shareholders, which is one of the criteria assessed by jury members.
125 Significant differences exist among participating countries, with Phase 2 beneficiaries in the north-west of Europe managing to raise more private resources than SMEs in the south and east (see Figure 16) 37.
Disparities between the venture capital markets in these countries partially explain such imbalances.

Countries for which no additional investment captured through web crawling technique do not appear in the chart.
47 126 The results of our survey among beneficiaries suggest that geographic location is a determining factor affecting a company’s propensity to look for equity and/or debt investment.
In particular, 84 % of respondents in the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom intend to look for equity injections, compared with 54 % in Spain and 42 % in Italy.
127 The SME-I EAG raised the issue of cross-country variation and differing cultures in the use of market-based instruments and recommended mapping the European landscape “for a better knowledge of potential co-investors and to verify if cross- border operators are able to cover some financial gaps when national systems do not work.
Platforms and specific events could help in this process” 38.
128 Picture 3 shows the flows of additional investments above €10 million to beneficiary countries, broken down by country of origin.
Of the €1.8 billion in additional investment raised by Phase 2 beneficiaries (see paragraph 119), approximately €400 million comes from investors headquartered in the United States and €181 million from investors in China.
The largest single investor in Phase 2 beneficiaries is based in the United States, and three of the five biggest investments (above €50 million) are from investors outside the EU.

49 Conclusions and recommendations 129 We found that the SME Instrument provides effective support to SMEs in developing their innovation projects and that having the EU branding helps companies to attract additional investment.
However, links have not been established with EU- backed financial instruments that could help beneficiaries scale-up and bring innovation projects to market.
Both Phases 1 and 2 of the instrument provide effective support to SMEs, though Phase 1 incurs disproportionally high administrative costs.
The instrument is competently managed by the Commission.
The high number of resubmissions and the limited resources have hindered the selection procedure and development of the business acceleration services.
130 All recommendations are applicable to the SME Instrument’s successor under Horizon Europe.
Targeting the right beneficiaries
131 The instrument’s broad objectives and targets, together with the changes introduced during the course of its implementation, have caused uncertainty for stakeholders.
The current profile of companies fits the academic model of firms with high growth potential but the instrument funds some SMEs that could have been financed by the market (see paragraphs 28 to 39).
Geographical reach
132 Participation in the instrument varies markedly between countries, partly due to factors beyond the control of the Commission but also because of the varying levels of support provided by National Contact Points and the Enterprise Europe Network (see paragraph 43 and 45 and Figure 5).
With a limited budget, the Commission organised events and communication activities, but its marketing and communication was neither structured nor sufficiently well-targeted to reach the right companies (see paragraphs 40 to 58).
50 Recommendation 1 – Improving communication strategy and support to National Contact Points, in particular for those Member States with the lowest level of participation The Commission should:
(a) focus better on marketing and communication strategy to raise awareness among SMEs targeted of the funding opportunities offered by the instrument and its successor under Horizon Europe,
(b) improve its support to National Contact Points for SMEs and the Enterprise Europe Network by promoting peer-learning projects and the exchange of best practice and ensuring that support to the network of National Contact Points for SMEs is operational at the beginning of the next framework programme.
Target implementation date: 2021
Selection of projects
133 Improvements have been made to evaluation and selection procedures over the lifetime of the instrument, with the presentation to a jury being a particularly useful addition in identifying the best proposals whilst complying with the time-to- grant target (see paragraphs 65 to 69).
134 There is variability in scores awarded in the remote evaluation, which can be partially explained by the limited resources and the high number of submissions.
Evaluator training is well appreciated, with scope for further feedback at various levels.
IT tools used are not fit for purpose, putting the evaluation process at risk (see paragraphs 61 to 64; 70 to 73).
135 The resubmission of unsuccessful proposals is a large and increasing drain on management and evaluation resources, increasing the administrative costs.
Moreover, it lowers the success rate thus discouraging participation (see paragraphs 74 to 79).
51 Recommendation 2 – Improving the selection procedure In order to optimise the use of resources and ensure an efficient selection of the best proposals, the Commission should refine the selection procedure in the following ways:
(a) provide remote evaluators with additional time to conduct their work;
(b) set up a two-way information channel between remote evaluators and jury members to allow the latter to access the remote evaluation and provide the former with feedback on the quality of their work;
(c) develop purpose-built IT tools to reliably manage the evaluation process;
(d) limit the number of times a proposal can be resubmitted, thereby freeing up resources which are currently used to re-perform evaluations of the same proposal in multiple successive cut-offs;
(e) In order to encourage the participation of more SMEs with excellent innovation projects, the Commission should publish the success rate per project proposal.
Target implementation date: 2021
Effectiveness of support in the SME Instrument phases
136 Phase 1 provides effective support, thanks to the fast selection process, the EU label for beneficiaries and the access to the business acceleration services.
In addition, it has attracted many innovative companies to the EU programme.
However, it imposes an excessive burden on the Commission´s administration of the instrument and there are countries where similar programmes already exist (see paragraphs 81 to 89) Phase 1 was discontinued as from September 2019.
137 Phase 2 of the SME-I provides effective support to beneficiaries and is highly appreciated by all stakeholders in its current form.
It provides EU branding that gives visibility to the companies and projects, helps them to raise additional investment, and allows access to the EU network of coaching and business acceleration services (see paragraphs 91 to 94).
52 Recommendation 3 – – Replacing Phase 1 and building on Phase 2 support to SMEs The Commission should:
(a) propose to the Member States that the Commission manage a scheme similar to Phase 1;
(b) provide beneficiaries of this scheme with access to coaching and Business Acceleration Services and an EU brand, and
(c) preserve a scheme similar to Phase 2 within the EIC under Horizon Europe, building on the results from the EIC Pilot.
Target implementation date: 2021
138 Coaching and business acceleration services have the potential to amplify effects of the instrument but, having been launched late, are not sufficiently visible and only a small share of SMEs made use of the services.
The resources allocated are limited and the services could be more tailor made and better target the demand side (see paragraphs 95 to 103).
Recommendation 4 – Enhancing Business Acceleration Services The Commission should enhance the business acceleration services by allocating appropriate resources to this area, to:
(a) deliver more tailor-made business acceleration services;
(b) increase awareness among beneficiaries employing a targeted communication approach and;
(c) better address the demand side establishing connections with large private customers and through public procurement for innovative projects.
Target implementation date: 2022
53 Attracting investment after SME Instrument funding
139 The majority of SME-I beneficiaries still need additional financing to support their innovation endeavours and bring their innovation projects to market.
However, the Commission has taken little action to create links with EU-backed financial instruments and has not explored collaboration opportunities with national promotional institutions.
Moreover, beneficiaries are largely unaware of EU-backed financial instruments and the Commission’s knowledge of beneficiaries’ financial needs is limited.
The 2018 EIB report on access to finance of beneficiaries confirmed that the available information on financial instruments is fragmented and communication between private and public capital providers is limited (see paragraphs 107 to 116).
Recommendation 5 – Creating links with financial instruments The Commission should:
(a) regularly collect information on the amount and type of funding needed by SME-I beneficiaries along the implementation of the innovation project;
(b) raise awareness among beneficiaries on the existence of different financial instruments at EU and national level and provide advice on those which would best fit their financial needs;
(c) identify and promote synergies with EU backed financial instruments in order to support SME-I beneficiaries in fund raising;
(d) collaborate with Member States and national promotional institutions to promote nationally-backed financial instruments that might meet the financial needs of the SME-I beneficiaries.
Target implementation date: 2022

REPLIES OF THE COMMISSION TO THE SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS “THE SME INSTRUMENT IN ACTION: AN EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMME FACING CHALLENGES”
I. The SME Instrument is the first- ever support scheme in the history of Research Framework Programme geared to innovative SMEs individually and implemented through an executive agency.
SMEs whose support was lagging behind in previous Framework Programmes have massively subscribed to this new support scheme which, over time, has been fine-tuned in order to better respond to their actual needs.
The success of the first cut-off of the European Innovation Council (EIC) Pilot Accelerator demonstrates that the pathway followed by the Commission corresponds to the expectations of innovative SMEs.
INTRODUCTION 20.
The Commission has implemented the testing of financial support of projects through equity financing as of October 2019.
OBSERVATIONS 31.
Members of the Access to Risk finance and SME Programme Committee - which often are also National Contact Points (NCPs) - have been regularly kept informed of the changes introduced in the SME instrument.
In addition, communication campaigns of such changes were implemented by RTD and EASME in order to widely raise the awareness of the stakeholders involved including NCPs and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN).
34. The SME instrument is targeted at all types of innovative SMEs showing a strong ambition to develop, grow and internationalize.
In line with the political priorities of the new Commission President elect, it is envisaged to implement a dedicated EIC Accelerator call for 2020 subject to the approval of the Strategic Programme Committee.
36. The Commission points out that this risk has been addressed in the EIC pilot as from 2019.
In addition, it underlines that there is a huge gap between the perception of the SME-I beneficiaries and the reality when it comes to raising money from venture capital (VC) or business angels where the success rate is quite low.
54. The Commission underlines that it made a major effort in promoting the EIC (enhanced) Pilot, organising SME-I workshops at various tech conferences around Europe (including Slush, Wolves Summit, Smart City).
The changes introduced by the Enhanced EIC Pilot were communicated through roadshows and dedicated events organised in all Member States.
Since the beginning of Horizon 2020, more than 65 outreach events have been organised in Member States and Associated Countries.
The Commission’s information campaign in the Member States, organized together with National Contact Points, was intensified in 2019 with the participation of SME’s.
The Commission initiated a one-off series of national and regional stakeholder consultations taking place in the Member States since June 2019 for the co-design of the Horizon Europe implementation modalities where the next policy on the SMEs is going to be defined.
57. The Commission considers that the Access4SME coordination and support action helped raise awareness amongst NCPs and EENs when changes in the design of the SME instrument have been introduced.

64. EASME had indeed to renew 25% of the pool of evaluators on a yearly basis to be in conformity with H2020 rules.
In response to the need for training of newcomers, since 2018, EASME has organised experts day in Brussels inviting both experienced and new experts to train them and to create synergies.
66. On the basis of the feedback received from the jury members, the Commission has put in place a practice in October 2019 whereby the jury members have two full weeks to review thoroughly the proposals.
68. In order to address the issue pointed out by ECA in this paragraph, the Commission has introduced a due diligence process in the EIC enhanced pilot.
As from October 2019 - within the enhanced EIC pilot offering blended finance - more detailed information has been requested from the applicants regarding the ownership, intellectual property rights (IPR) and team composition.
These aspects are assessed now by the evaluators at remote and interviews steps.
74. Although not foreseen in the legal basis of the SME instrument and subject to approval of the relevant Programme Committee, the Commission might propose a procedure limiting the number of resubmissions.
103. The Commission stresses that the launch of the business acceleration services underwent thorough preparation and was preceded by an open procurement procedure.
107. EASME collects information about additional financial needs of some beneficiaries, during and after the implementation period of the grant, through several channels (application to BAS investor events and company profile in Scaleup EU investor matching tool).
Moreover, as from the cut-off of October 2019, the companies need to provide how they intend to finance all needed development activities until market entry, going beyond the requested grant and/or equity.
It includes an indication both about amounts needed and sources of potential funding.
111. The Commission has started to address the issue referred to by ECA in this paragraph by the implementation of the EIC enhanced pilot in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 132.
Outreach and communication with stakeholders is a key priority of the Commission for the sound implementation of the current and future framework programmes.
Outreach events on implementation modalities of Horizon 2020 are regularly organised in Member States and Associated Countries.

Recommendation 1 – Improving communication strategy and support to National Contact Points, in particular for those Member States with the lowest level of participation The Commission accepts this recommendation.
135. The Commission intends to plan a new approach as recommended as of January 2021 for Horizon Europe.
Recommendation 2 – Improving the selection procedure
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
a) The Commission has implemented this recommendation as from the evaluation process started in October 2019, by sending the proposals two weeks in advance.
In addition, from March 2020, the remote experts will have 0,5 day to evaluate one proposal against 0,3 until January 2020.

Recommendation 3 – Replacing Phase 1 and building on Phase 2 support to SMEs
The Commission accepts this recommendation.
a) Some Member States under the lead of the Czech Republic have created an informal working group in order to replicate Phase 1 funded at national level but keeping a central EU evaluation.
The Commission might propose to support them in their coordination through a dedicated grant.
c) The Horizon Europe Partial General Agreement foresees the continuation of the grant-only scheme in the EIC Accelerator with a budget equivalent to Horizon 2020 while blended finance should be the main use of the EIC Accelerator budget.
Recommendation 4 – Enhancing Business Acceleration Services
The Commission accepts this recommendation, within the resources available for the successor of the SME Instrument under the next MFF.
139. Concerning raising the awareness of beneficiaries, a wide communication campaign has been implemented for the InnovFin financial instruments by the EIB and EIF in all Member States between 2014-2016 developing contacts with many SMEs although SME instrument beneficiaries were not specifically targeted.
An Enhanced EIC Pilot communication campaign in Spring 2019 raised awareness of potential beneficiaries on the possible equity financing through the EIC Accelerator.
The Commission has also started to collect data as from the cut-off of October 2019 from the application process on the financial needs, including grants and equity of the companies applying to successfully scale-up.
Recommendation 5 – Creating links with financial instruments
a) The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The Grant and the equity agreements will regularly monitor the financial needs throughout the implementation of the project and the scaling-up phases.
b) The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The Commission will continue its awareness-raising activities.
c) The Commission accepts this recommendation.
The Horizon Europe partial General Agreement foresees the possibility for beneficiaries to apply for equity only as from 2021.
d) The Commission partially accepts this recommendation.
Considering that the recommendation involves also Member States, the Commission can only implement it on a best effort basis.
The Commission will raise the awareness of Member States and national promotional institutions through the channel of the relevant Programme Committee.
The creation of the Seal of Excellence for successful proposals which could not be awarded a SME instrument grant was a first attempt to build synergies with national eco-system supporting innovation.

3 With €3 billion for 2014-2020, the EU’s SME instrument strives to support innovation in SMEs and start-ups by filling the gap in funding and increasing commercialisation of research results.
We assessed whether the SME instrument delivers the expected benefits.
Overall, we concluded that it provides effective assistance to SMEs in developing their innovation projects and that having the EU branding helps companies to attract additional investment.
The Commission competently manages the instrument.
However, we recommend improving the targeting of beneficiaries, the geographical outreach and the selection of projects.
Also, more can be done to attract additional funding that would help bring innovation projects to market.
As the SME Instrument has been redesigned for 2021-2027 as part of the European Innovation Council (EIC), we make recommendations in particular for preserving aspects of its design, improving project selection, enhancing business acceleration services and creating synergies with other financial instruments.
