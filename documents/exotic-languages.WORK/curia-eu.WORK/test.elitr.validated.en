ORDER OF THE COURT (Third Chamber)
THE COURT (Third Chamber)
The Court, proposing to give its decision by reasoned order in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 104(3) of its Rules of Procedure, makes the following Order.
This reference for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article 5(1) and (5) of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (OJ 2001 L 167, p. 10).
Legal context
European Union Law
Directive 2001/29 states the following in Recitals (4), (9) to (11), (21) (22), (31) and (33) in the preamble thereto: a harmonised legal framework on copyright and related rights, through increased legal certainty and while providing for a high level of protection of intellectual property, will foster substantial investment in creativity and innovation, including network infrastructure.
Any harmonisation of copyright and related rights must take as a basis a high level of protection, since such rights are crucial to intellectual creation.
If authors or performers are to continue their creative and artistic work, they have to receive an appropriate reward for the use of their work.
A rigorous, effective system for the protection of copyright and related rights is one of the main ways of ensuring that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources and of safeguarding the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers.
This Directive should define the scope of the acts covered by the reproduction right with regard to the different beneficiaries.
This should be done in conformity with the acquis communautaire.
A broad definition of these acts is needed to ensure legal certainty within the internal market.
The objective of proper support for the dissemination of culture must not be achieved by sacrificing strict protection of rights or by tolerating illegal forms of distribution of counterfeited or pirated works.
A fair balance of rights and interests between the different categories of rightholders, as well as between the different categories of rightholders and users of protected subject-matter must be safeguarded.
The exclusive right of reproduction should be subject to an exception to allow certain acts of temporary reproduction, which are transient or incidental reproductions, forming an integral and essential part of a technological process and carried out for the sole purpose of enabling either efficient transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or a lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made.
To the extent that they meet these conditions, this exception should include acts which enable browsing as well as acts of caching to take place, including those which enable transmission systems to function efficiently, provided that the intermediary does not modify the information and does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognised and used by industry, to obtain data on the use of the information.
A use should be considered lawful where it is authorised by the rightholder or not restricted by law.
Article 1(1) of Directive 2001/29 states: this Directive concerns the legal protection of copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market, with particular emphasis on the information society.
Pursuant to Article 2(a) of that directive:
Member States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part:
a) for authors, of their works.
Article 5 of that directive states:
Temporary acts of reproduction referred to in Article 2, which are transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable:
a) a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or
b) a lawful use of a work or other subject-matter to be made, and which have no independent economic significance, shall be exempted from the reproduction right provided for in Article 2.
Member States may provide for exceptions or limitations to the rights provided for in Articles 2 and 3 in the following cases:
c) reproduction by the press, communication to the public or making available of published articles on current economic, political or religious topics or of broadcast works or other subject-matter of the same character, in cases where such use is not expressly reserved, and as long as the source, including the author’s name, is indicated, or use of works or other subject-matter in connection with the reporting of current events, to the extent justified by the informatory purpose and as long as the source, including the author’s name, is indicated, unless this turns out to be impossible;
d) quotations for purposes such as criticism or review, provided that they relate to a work or other subject-matter which has already been lawfully made available to the public, that, unless this turns out to be impossible, the source, including the author’s name, is indicated, and that their use is in accordance with fair practice, and to the extent required by the specific purpose;
The exceptions and limitations provided for in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall only be applied in certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject-matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.
National law
Articles 2 and 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 were transposed into Danish law by Paragraphs 2 and 11a(1) of Law No 395 on copyright (lov n°395 om ophavsret) of 14 June 1995 (Lovtidende 1995 A, p. 1796), as amended and consolidated by, inter alia, Law No 1051 (lov n° 1051) of 17 December 2002 (Lovtidende 2002 A, p. 7881).
The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling.
Infopaq operates a media monitoring and analysis business which consists primarily in drawing up summaries of selected articles from Danish daily newspapers and other periodicals.
The articles are selected on the basis of certain subject criteria chosen by its customers and is carried out by means of a process known as ‘data capture’.
The summaries are sent to customers by e-mail.
The DDF is the professional association of Danish daily newspaper publishers whose function is inter alia to assist its members with copyright issues.
In 2005, DDF became aware that Infopaq was scanning newspaper articles for commercial purposes without authorisation from the relevant rightholders.
Taking the view that such consent was necessary for processing articles using the process in question, DDF complained to Infopaq about this procedure.
The data capture process comprises the five phases described below which, according to DDF, lead to four acts of reproduction of newspaper articles.
First, the publications concerned are registered manually by Infopaq employees in an electronic registration database.
Secondly, once the spines are cut off the publications so that all the pages consist of loose sheets, the publications are scanned.
The section to be scanned is selected from the registration database before the publication is put into the scanner.
Scanning allows a Tagged Image File Format (‘TIFF’) file to be created for each page of the publication.
When scanning is completed, the TIFF file is transferred to an OCR (‘Optical Character Recognition’) server.
Thirdly, the OCR server translates the TIFF file into data that can be processed digitally.
During that process, the image of each letter is translated into a character code which tells the computer what type of letter it is.
For instance, the image of the letters ‘TDC’ is translated into something the computer can treat as the letters ‘TDC’ and put in a text format which can be recognised by the computer’s system.
These data are saved as a text file which can be understood by any text processing program.
The OCR process is completed by deleting the TIFF file.
Fourthly, the text file is processed to find a search word defined beforehand.
Each time a match for a search word is found, a file is generated giving the publication, section and page number on which the match was found, together with a value expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100 indicating how far into the text it is to be found, in order to make it easier to read the article.
In order to make it even easier to find the search word when reading the article, the five words which come before and after the search word are captured (‘extract of 11 words’).
At the end of the process the text file is deleted.
Fifthly, at the end of the data capture process a cover sheet is printed out in respect of all the pages where the relevant search word was found.
The following is an example of the text of a cover sheet:
4 November 2005 — Dagbladet Arbejderen, page 3:
TDC: 73% “forthcoming sale of the telecommunications group TDC, which is expected to be bought”.
Infopaq disputed the claim that the procedure required consent from the rightholders and brought an action against DDF before the Østre Landsret (Eastern Regional Court), claiming that DDF should be ordered to acknowledge that Infopaq is entitled to apply the abovementioned procedure without the consent of DDF or of its members.
Since that claim was rejected, Infopaq brought an appeal before the referring court.
According to the Højesteret, it is not disputed in this case that consent from the rightholders is not required to engage in press monitoring activity and the writing of summaries consisting in physical reading of each publication, selection of the relevant articles on the basis of predetermined search words, and transmission of a manually prepared cover sheet for the summary writers, giving an identified search word in an article and its position in the newspaper.
Similarly, the parties in the main proceedings do not dispute that in itself summary writing is lawful and does not require consent from the rightholders.
Nor is it disputed in this case that the data capture process described above involves two acts of reproduction: the creation of a TIFF file when the printed articles are scanned and the conversion of the TIFF file into a text file.
In addition, it is common ground that this procedure entails the reproduction of parts of the scanned printed articles since the extract of 11 words is stored and those 11 words are printed out on paper.
There is, however, disagreement between the parties as to whether the two last mentioned acts constitute reproduction as contemplated by Article 2 of Directive 2001/29.
Likewise, they disagree as to whether, if there is reproduction, the acts in question, taken as a whole, are covered by the exemption from the right of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of that directive.
In those circumstances, the Højesteret, on 21 December 2007, decided to stay the proceedings and to refer 13 questions concerning the interpretation of Articles 2(a) and 5(1) and (5) of that directive to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.
The Court responded to these questions in its judgment of 16 July 2009 in Case C‑5/08 Infopaq International [2009] ECR I‑6569 (‘Infopaq International’), in which it found, first, that an act occurring during a data capture process, which consists of storing an extract of a protected work comprising 11 words and printing out that extract, is such as to come within the concept of reproduction in part within the meaning of Article 2 of Directive 2001/29, if, which it was for the national court to establish, the elements thus reproduced are the expression of the intellectual creation of their author.
Secondly, the Court concluded that while Article 5(1) of that directive allowed an exemption from the reproduction right for temporary acts of reproduction which are transient or incidental, the last act of the data capture process in issue in the main proceedings, during which Infopaq printed out extracts of 11 words did not constitute such a transient or incidental act.
Consequently, the Court found that that act and the data capture process of which it was part could not be carried out without the consent of the rightholders.
Following that judgment, however, the Højesteret found that it could still be called upon to decide whether Infopaq infringed Directive 2001/29 by carrying out that process, with the exception of the extract of 11 words, that is to say by confining itself to the implementation of the first three acts of reproduction.
The Højesteret therefore referred the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:
1. Is the stage of the technological process at which temporary acts of reproduction take place relevant to whether they constitute “an integral and essential part of a technological process”, within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29?
2. Can temporary acts of reproduction be an “integral and essential part of a technological process” if they consist of manual scanning of entire newspaper articles whereby the latter are transformed from a printed medium into a digital medium?
3. Does the concept of “lawful use”, within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29, include any form of use which does not require the copyright holder’s consent?
4. Does the concept of “lawful use”, within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29, include the scanning by a commercial business of entire newspaper articles and subsequent processing of the reproduction, for use in the business’s summary writing, even where the rightholder has not given consent to those acts, if the other requirements in the provision are satisfied?
Is it relevant to the answer to the question whether the 11 words are stored after the data capture process is terminated?
5. What criteria should be used to assess whether temporary acts of reproduction have “independent economic significance”, within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 if the other requirements in the provision are satisfied?
6. Can the user’s efficiency gains from temporary acts of reproduction be taken into account in assessing whether the acts have “independent economic significance”, within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29?
7. Can the scanning by a commercial business of entire newspaper articles and the subsequent processing of the reproduction, be regarded as constituting “certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation” of the newspaper articles and “not unreasonably [prejudicing] the legitimate interests of the rightholder”, pursuant to Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29, if the requirements in Article 5(1) of the directive are satisfied?
Is it relevant to the answer to the question whether the 11 words are stored after the data capture process is terminated?
Consideration of the questions referred
Pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 104(3) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the answer to a question referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling may be clearly deduced from existing case-law, the Court may, after hearing the Advocate General, at any time, and referring to the case-law in issue, give its decision by reasoned order.
That is the situation in the present case.
Preliminary observations
Under Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29, an act of reproduction is exempted from the reproduction right provided for in Article 2 thereof provided that it fulfils five conditions, namely, where the act is temporary; it is transient or incidental; it is an integral and essential part of a technological process; its sole purpose is to enable a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary or a lawful use of a work or protected subject-matter; and the act has no independent economic significance.
First, it must be borne in mind that those conditions are cumulative in the sense that non-compliance with any one of them will lead to the act of reproduction not being exempted, pursuant to Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29, from the reproduction right provided for in Article 2 of that directive (Infopaq International, paragraph 55).
Secondly, it is apparent from the Court’s case-law that the conditions listed above must be interpreted strictly because Article 5(1) of that directive is a derogation from the general principle established by that directive, namely the requirement that the rightholder authorise any reproduction of a protected work (see Infopaq International, paragraphs 56 and 57, and Cases C-403/08 and C-429/08 Football Association Premier League and Others [2011] ECR I-9083, paragraph 162).
It is in that context that it is necessary to examine the questions referred for a preliminary ruling by which the referring court seeks to determine whether the acts of reproduction performed during a technological process, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, satisfy the third, fourth and fifth conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29, and those referred to in Article 5(5) of that directive.
However, the reference for a preliminary ruling does not concern the first and second conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of that directive, since the Court has already ruled on those conditions at paragraphs 61 to 71 of the judgment in Infopaq International.
Questions 1 and 2 relating to the condition that the acts of reproduction must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process.
By its first and second questions, which should be considered together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the acts of reproduction carried out during a data capture process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, fulfil the condition that those acts must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process.
In that regard, the referring court asks in particular whether the stage of the technological process at which those acts took place and the fact that that technological process involves human intervention should be taken into account.
The concept of the ‘integral and essential part of a technological process’ requires the temporary acts of reproduction to be carried out entirely in the context of the implementation of the technological process and, therefore, not to be carried out, fully or partially, outside of such a process.
This concept also assumes that the completion of the temporary act of reproduction is necessary, in that the technological process concerned could not function correctly and efficiently without that act (see, to that effect, Infopaq International, paragraph 61).
Furthermore, given that Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 does not specify at which stage of the technological process the acts of temporary reproduction must be carried out, it cannot be excluded that such an act can initiate or terminate that process.
Similarly, there is nothing in that provision to indicate that the technological process must not involve any human intervention and that, in particular, manual activation of that process be precluded, in order to achieve a first temporary reproduction.
In the present case, it should be recalled that the technological process in question consists of carrying out electronic and automatic research in newspaper articles and identifying and extracting predefined key words from those articles, in order to render the drafting of summaries of newspaper articles more efficient.
In that context, there are three successive acts of reproduction involved.
They materialise through the creation of the TIFF file, then that of the text file and, finally, through that of the file containing the extract of 11 words.
In that context, first, it is not in dispute that none of those acts are completed outside of that technological process.
Secondly, in the light of the considerations set out at paragraphs 30 to 32 of the present order, it is irrelevant that such a technological process is activated by the manual insertion of newspaper articles into a scanner, in order to achieve a first temporary reproduction — the creation of a TIFF file — and that it is terminated by an act of temporary reproduction, namely the creation of a file containing an extract of 11 words.
Finally, it should be noted that the technological process in question could not function correctly and efficiently without the acts of reproduction concerned.
That technological process aims at identifying predefined key words in newspaper articles and extracting them on a digital medium.
Such electronic research thus requires a transformation of those articles, from a paper-based medium, into digital data, since that transformation is necessary in order to recognise that data, to identify the key words and to extract those key words.
Contrary to DDF’s claim, that conclusion is not invalidated by the fact that it would be possible to draft the summaries of the newspaper articles without reproduction.
In that context, it is sufficient to note that such a summary is completed outside of that process, being subsequent to it, and, therefore, it is irrelevant in assessing whether such a process can function correctly and efficiently without the acts of temporary reproduction concerned.
In view of the above, the answer to the first and second questions is that Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the acts of temporary reproduction carried out during a data capture process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, fulfil the condition that those acts must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process, notwithstanding the fact that they initiate and terminate that process and involve human intervention.
Questions 3 and 4 relating to the condition that the acts of reproduction must pursue a sole purpose, namely to enable either the transmission of a protected work or a protected subject-matter in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or the lawful use of such a work or such a subject-matter.
By its third and fourth questions, which should be considered together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the acts of temporary reproduction carried out during a data capture process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, fulfil the condition that the acts of reproduction must pursue a sole purpose, namely to enable either the transmission of a protected work or a protected subject-matter in a network between third parties by an intermediary, or the lawful use of such a work or such a subject-matter.
It must be noted at the outset that the acts of reproduction concerned are not intended to enable a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary.
In those circumstances, it should be examined whether the sole purpose of those acts is to enable the lawful use of a protected work or a protected subject-matter.
In that respect, as is apparent from Recital 33 in the preamble to Directive 2001/29, a use should be considered lawful where it is authorised by the right holder or where it is not restricted by the applicable legislation (Football Association Premier League and Others, paragraph 168).
In the case in the main proceedings, it should be noted, first, that in the situation outlined by the referring court, where the last act of the technological process of data capture, namely the printing of the extract of 11 words, is not performed, the technological process concerned, including therefore the creation of the TIFF file, that of the text file and that of the file containing the extract of 11 words, is intended to enable a more efficient drafting of summaries of newspaper articles and, therefore, a use of those articles.
Secondly, there is nothing in the file before the Court to indicate that the result of that technological process, namely the extract of 11 words, is intended to enable another use.
In respect of the lawful or unlawful character of the use, it is not disputed that the drafting of a summary of newspaper articles is not, in the present case, authorised by the holders of the copyright over these articles.
However, it should be noted that such an activity is not restricted by European Union legislation.
Furthermore, it is apparent from the statements of both Infopaq and the DDF that the drafting of that summary is not an activity which is restricted by Danish legislation.
In those circumstances, that use cannot be considered to be unlawful.
In view of the foregoing, the answer to the third and fourth questions is that Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the acts of temporary reproduction carried out during a data capture process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, fulfil the condition that those acts must pursue a sole purpose, namely the lawful use of a protected work or a protected subject-matter.
Questions 5 and 6 relating to the condition that the acts of reproduction must not have independent economic significance.
In the light of the context of the case in the main proceedings as a whole, as well as the scope of the above questions, the fifth and sixth question must be understood as seeking to ascertain whether the temporary acts of reproduction carried out during a data capture process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, fulfil the condition laid down in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 that those acts must not have independent economic significance.
In that regard, it should be recalled that the acts of temporary reproduction, within the meaning of Article 5(1), aim to make access to the protected works and their use possible.
Since those works have a specific economic value, access to them and their use necessarily has economic significance (see, to that effect, Football Association Premier League and Others, paragraph 174).
Furthermore, as is apparent from Recital 33 in the preamble to Directive 2001/29, the acts of temporary reproduction — like the acts enabling ‘browsing’ and ‘caching’ — have the purpose of facilitating the use of a work or making that use more efficient.
Thus, an inherent feature of those acts is to enable the achievement of efficiency gains in the context of such use and, consequently, to lead to increased profits or a reduction in production costs.
However, those acts must not have independent economic significance, in that the economic advantage derived from their implementation must not be either distinct or separable from the economic advantage derived from the lawful use of the work concerned and it must not generate an additional economic advantage going beyond that derived from that use of the protected work (see, to that effect, Football Association Premier League and Others, paragraph 175).
The efficiency gains resulting from the implementation of the acts of temporary reproduction, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, have no such independent economic significance, inasmuch as the economic advantages derived from their application only materialise during the use of the reproduced subject matter, so that they are neither distinct nor separable from the advantages derived from its use.
On the other hand, an advantage derived from an act of temporary reproduction is distinct and separable if the author of that act is likely to make a profit due to the economic exploitation of the temporary reproductions themselves.
The same is true if the acts of temporary reproduction lead to a change in the subject matter reproduced, as it exists when the technological process concerned is initiated, because those acts no longer aim to facilitate its use, but the use of a different subject matter.
Consequently, the answer to the fifth and sixth questions is that Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the acts of temporary reproduction carried out during a data capture process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, fulfil the condition that those acts must not have an independent economic significance provided, first, that the implementation of those acts does not enable the generation of an additional profit, going beyond that derived from lawful use of the protected work and, secondly, that the acts of temporary reproduction do not lead to a modification of that work.
Question 7 relating to the condition that the acts of reproduction must neither conflict with the normal exploitation of the work nor unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.
By its seventh question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the acts of temporary reproduction carried out during a data capture process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, fulfil the condition that those acts must neither conflict with the normal exploitation of the work nor unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.
In that regard, suffice it to note that if those acts of reproduction fulfil all the conditions of Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29, as interpreted by the case-law of the Court, it must be held that they do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder (Football Association Premier League and Others, paragraph 181).
Consequently, the answer to the seventh question is that Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that, if they fulfil all the conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of that directive, the acts of temporary reproduction carried out during a ‘data capture’ process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, must be regarded as fulfilling the condition that the acts of reproduction may not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.
Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the proceedings pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.
Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.
On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:
Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society must be interpreted as meaning that the acts of temporary reproduction carried out during a ‘data capture’ process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, fulfil the condition that those acts must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process, notwithstanding the fact that they initiate and terminate that process and involve human intervention; fulfil the condition that those acts of reproduction must pursue a sole purpose, namely to enable the lawful use of a protected work or a protected subject-matter; fulfil the condition that those acts must not have an independent economic significance provided, first, that the implementation of those acts does not enable the generation of an additional profit going beyond that derived from the lawful use of the protected work and, secondly, that the acts of temporary reproduction do not lead to a modification of that work.
Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that, if they fulfil all the conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of that directive, the acts of temporary reproduction carried out during a ‘data capture’ process, such as those in issue in the main proceedings, must be regarded as fulfilling the condition that the acts of reproduction may not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder.
JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (Grand Chamber)
January 2012 ( *1 )
THE COURT (Grand Chamber),
After hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 8 September 2011, gives the following Judgment.
This reference for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article 7 of Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (OJ 2003 L 299, p. 9).
The reference has been made in the proceedings between Ms Dominguez and her employer, the Centre informatique du Centre Ouest Atlantique (‘the CICOA’), concerning Ms Dominguez’s claim for entitlement to paid annual leave not taken in respect of the period between November 2005 and January 2007 due to absence from work granted after an accident and, in the alternative, for compensation.
Legal context
European Union legislation
Article 1 of Directive 2003/88 provides: Purpose and scope.
This Directive lays down minimum safety and health requirements for the organisation of working time.
This Directive applies to minimum periods of annual leave.
Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that every worker is entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks in accordance with the conditions for entitlement to, and granting of, such leave laid down by national legislation and/or practice.
The minimum period of paid annual leave may not be replaced by an allowance in lieu, except where the employment relationship is terminated.
Article 15 of that directive provides more favourable provisions.
This Directive shall not affect Member States’ right to apply or introduce laws, regulations or administrative provisions more favourable to the protection of the safety and health of workers or to facilitate or permit the application of collective agreements or agreements concluded between the two sides of industry which are more favourable to the protection of the safety and health of workers.
Article 17 of Directive 2003/88 provides that Member States may derogate from certain provisions of that directive.
No derogation is allowed with regard to Article 7 of the directive.
National legislation
The first paragraph of Article L. 223-2 of the Code du travail (Labour Code) provides:
A worker who, during the reference year, has been employed by the same employer for a period equivalent to a minimum of one month of actual work shall be entitled to leave, the length of which shall be calculated on the basis of two and a half working days for each month worked, provided the total period of leave that may be requested does not exceed thirty working days.
Article L. 223-4 of the Code du travail provides:
Periods equivalent to four weeks or twenty-four days of work shall be treated as equivalent to one month of actual work for the purpose of calculating the length of leave.
Periods of paid leave, compensatory leave, periods of maternity leave, leave acquired by reason of reduced working time and periods of an uninterrupted duration not exceeding one year during which performance of the contract of employment is suspended owing to a work-related accident or occupational disease, shall be treated as periods of actual work.
The fourth paragraph of Article XIV of the model rules annexed to the national collective labour agreement for staff of social security bodies provides:
No annual leave entitlement is given in a particular year in respect of absences as a result of the following: illness or prolonged illness that has resulted in a break in work of twelve consecutive months or more, leave entitlement begins again on the date on which work is resumed, the length of leave being calculated in proportion to the time of actual work that has not yet given rise to the allocation of annual leave.
The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling.
Ms Dominguez, who has been employed by the CICOA since 1987, is covered by the collective labour agreement for staff of social security bodies.
Following an accident on the journey between her home and her place of work she was absent from work from 3 November 2005 until 7 January 2007.
Ms Dominguez brought a claim before the industrial relations court (juridiction prud’homale) and also the Cour d’appel, Limoges for 22.5 days’ paid leave in respect of that period and, in the alternative, a payment in lieu of leave.
Since those courts dismissed her claims, Ms Dominguez brought an appeal on a point of law.
She argues that an accident on the journey to or from work is a work-related accident and is covered by the same arrangements as a work-related accident.
Thus, under Article L. 223-4 of the Code du travail, the period of suspension of her contract of employment following the accident on the journey to work should be treated as being equivalent to actual work time for the purpose of calculating her paid leave.
In the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice relating to Article 7 of Directive 2003/88, the Cour de cassation (French Court of Cassation) was unsure whether the relevant French provisions were compatible with that article.
In those circumstances, the Cour de cassation decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:
Must Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 be interpreted as precluding national provisions or practices which make entitlement to paid annual leave conditional on a minimum of ten days’ (or one month’s) actual work during the reference period?
If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, does Article 7 of Directive 2003/88, which imposes a specific obligation on an employer in so far as it creates entitlement to paid leave for a worker who is absent on health grounds for a period of one year or more, require a national court hearing proceedings between individuals to disregard a conflicting national provision which makes entitlement to paid annual leave in such a case conditional on at least ten days’ actual work during the reference year?
Since Article 7 of Directive 2003/88/EC does not distinguish between workers according to whether their absence from work during the reference period is due to a work-related accident, an occupational disease, an accident on the journey to or from work or a non-occupational disease, are workers entitled, under that directive, to paid leave of the same length whatever the reason for their absence on health grounds, or must that directive be interpreted as not precluding the length of paid leave differing according to the reason for the worker’s absence, if national law provides that in certain circumstances the length of paid annual leave may exceed the minimum of four weeks provided for by [Directive 2003/88]?
The first question
By its first question, the national court asks, essentially, whether Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 must be interpreted as precluding national provisions or practices which make entitlement to paid annual leave conditional on a minimum period of ten days’ or one month’s actual work during the reference period.
In that regard it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, the entitlement of every worker to paid annual leave must be regarded as a particularly important principle of European Union social law from which there can be no derogations and whose implementation by the competent national authorities must be confined within the limits expressly laid down by Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (OJ 1993 L 307, p. 18) itself, that directive being now codified by Directive 2003/88 (see Case C-173/99 BECTU [2001] ECR I-4881, paragraph 43; Joined Cases C-350/06 and C-520/06 Schultz-Hoff and Others [2009] ECR I-179, paragraph 22; and Case C-214/10 KHS [2011] ECR I-11757, paragraph 23).
Thus, Directive 93/104 must be interpreted as precluding Member States from unilaterally limiting the entitlement to paid annual leave conferred on all workers by applying a precondition for such entitlement which has the effect of preventing certain workers from benefiting from it (BECTU, paragraph 52).
Although Member States are free to lay down, in their domestic legislation, conditions for the exercise and implementation of the right to paid annual leave, they are not entitled to make the very existence of that right subject to any preconditions whatsoever (see Schultz-Hoff and Others, paragraph 46).
Thus, the requisite arrangements for implementation and application of the requirements of Directive 93/104, codified by Directive 2003/88, may display certain divergences as regards the conditions for exercising the right to paid annual leave, but that directive does not allow Member States to exclude the very existence of a right expressly granted to all workers (BECTU, paragraph 55, and Schultz-Hoff and Others, paragraph 47).
Also, since Directive 2003/88 does not make any distinction between workers who are absent from work on sick leave during the reference period and those who have in fact worked in the course of that period (see Schultz-Hoff and Others, paragraph 40) it follows that, with regard to workers on sick leave which has been duly granted, the right to paid annual leave conferred by that directive on all workers cannot be made subject by a Member State to a condition that the worker has actually worked during the reference period laid down by that State (Schultz-Hoff and Others, paragraph 41).
It follows from the foregoing that Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 must be interpreted as precluding national provisions or practices which make entitlement to paid annual leave conditional on a minimum period of ten days’ or one month’s actual work during the reference period.
The second question
By its second question, the national court asks, essentially, whether Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 must be interpreted as meaning that in proceedings between individuals a national provision which makes entitlement to paid annual leave conditional on a minimum period of actual work during the reference period, which is contrary to Article 7, must be disregarded.
It should be stated at the outset that the question whether a national provision must be disapplied in as much as it conflicts with European Union law arises only if no compatible interpretation of that provision proves possible.
In that regard, the Court has consistently held that when national courts apply domestic law they are bound to interpret it, so far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the directive concerned in order to achieve the result sought by the directive and consequently comply with the third paragraph of Article 288 TFEU.
This obligation to interpret national law in conformity with European Union law is inherent in the system of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, since it permits national courts, for the matters within their jurisdiction, to ensure the full effectiveness of European Union law when they determine the disputes before them (see, inter alia, Joined Cases C-397/01 to C-403/01 Pfeiffer and Others [2004] ECR I-8835, paragraph 114; Joined Cases C-378/07 to C-380/07 Angelidaki and Others [2009] ECR I-3071, paragraphs 197 and 198; and Case C-555/07 Kücükdeveci [2010] ECR I-365, paragraph 48).
It is true that this principle of interpreting national law in conformity with European Union law has certain limitations.
Thus the obligation on a national court to refer to the content of a directive when interpreting and applying the relevant rules of domestic law is limited by general principles of law and it cannot serve as the basis for an interpretation of national law contra legem (see Case C-268/06 Impact [2008] ECR I-2483, paragraph 100, and Angelidaki and Others, paragraph 199).
In the dispute in the main proceedings, the national court states that it has encountered such a limitation.
According to that court, the first paragraph of Article L. 223-2 of the Code du travail, which makes entitlement to paid annual leave conditional on a minimum of one month’s actual work during the reference period, is not amenable to an interpretation that is compatible with Article 7 of Directive 2003/88.
In that regard, it should be noted that the principle that national law must be interpreted in conformity with European Union law also requires national courts to do whatever lies within their jurisdiction, taking the whole body of domestic law into consideration and applying the interpretative methods recognised by domestic law, with a view to ensuring that the directive in question is fully effective and achieving an outcome consistent with the objective pursued by it (see Case C-212/04 Adeneler and Others [2006] ECR I-6057, paragraph 111, and Angelidaki and Others, paragraph 200).
In the dispute in the main proceedings, Article L. 223-4 of the Code du travail, which provides an exemption from the requirement of actual work during the reference period in respect of certain periods of absence from work, is an integral part of the domestic law to be taken into consideration by the French courts.
If Article L. 223-4 of the Code du travail were to be interpreted by the national court as meaning that a period of absence due to an accident on the journey to or from work must be treated as being equivalent to a period of absence due to an accident at work in order to give full effect to Article 7 of Directive 2003/88, that court would not encounter the limitation, referred to in paragraph 26 above, as regards interpreting Article L. 223-2 of the Code du travail in accordance with European Union law.
In that regard, it should be pointed out that Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 does not make any distinction between workers who are absent on sick leave during the reference period and those who have actually worked in the course of that period (see paragraph 20 above).
It follows that the right to paid annual leave of a worker who is absent from work on health grounds during the reference period cannot be made subject by a Member State to a condition concerning the obligation actually to have worked during that period.
Thus, according to Article 7 of Directive 2003/88, any worker, whether he be on sick leave during the reference period as a result of an accident at his place of work or elsewhere, or as the result of sickness of whatever nature or origin, cannot have his entitlement to at least four weeks’ paid annual leave affected.
It is clear from the foregoing that it is for the national court to determine, taking the whole body of domestic law into consideration, in particular Article L. 223-4 of the Code du travail, and applying the interpretative methods recognised by domestic law with a view to ensuring that Directive 2003/88 is fully effective and achieving an outcome consistent with the objective pursued by it, whether it can find an interpretation of that law that allows the absence of the worker due to an accident on the journey to or from work to be treated as being equivalent to one of the situations covered by that article of the Code du travail.
In the event that such an interpretation is not possible, it is necessary to consider whether Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 has a direct effect and, if so, whether Ms Dominguez may rely on that direct effect against the respondents in the main proceedings, in particular her employer, the CICOA, in view of their legal nature.
In that regard, it is clear from the settled case-law of the Court that, whenever the provisions of a directive appear, so far as their subject-matter is concerned, to be unconditional and sufficiently precise, they may be relied upon before the national courts by individuals against the State where the latter has failed to implement the directive in domestic law by the end of the period prescribed or where it has failed to implement the directive correctly (see, inter alia, Pfeiffer and Others, paragraph 103 and the case-law cited).
Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 fulfils those criteria as it imposes on Member States, in unequivocal terms, a precise obligation as to the result to be achieved that is not coupled with any condition regarding application of the rule laid down by it, which gives every worker entitlement to at least four weeks’ paid annual leave.
Even though Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 leaves the Member States a degree of latitude when they adopt the conditions for entitlement to, and granting of, the paid annual leave which it provides for, that does not alter the precise and unconditional nature of the obligation laid down in that article.
It is appropriate to note in that regard that Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 is not one of the provisions of that directive from which Article 17 thereof permits derogation.
It is therefore possible to determine the minimum protection which must be provided in any event by the Member States pursuant to that Article 7 (see, mutatis mutandis, Pfeiffer and Others, paragraph 105).
Since Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 fulfils the conditions required to produce a direct effect, it should also be noted that the CICOA, one of the two respondents in the main proceedings and Ms Dominguez’s employer, is a body operating in the field of social security.
It is true that the Court has consistently held that a directive cannot of itself impose obligations on an individual and cannot therefore be relied on as such against an individual (see, inter alia, Case C-91/92 Faccini Dori [1994] ECR I-3325, paragraph 20; Case C-192/94 El Corte Inglés [1996] ECR I-1281, paragraph 15; Pfeiffer and Others, paragraph 108; and Kücükdeveci, paragraph 46).
It should also be recalled however that, where a person is able to rely on a directive not as against an individual but as against the State he may do so regardless of the capacity in which the latter is acting, whether as employer or as public authority.
In either case it is necessary to prevent the State from taking advantage of its own failure to comply with European Union law (see, inter alia, Case 152/84 Marshall [1986] ECR 723, paragraph 49; Case C-188/89 Foster and Others [1990] ECR I-3313, paragraph 17; and Case C-343/98 Collino and Chiappero [2000] ECR I-6659, paragraph 22).
Thus the entities against which the provisions of a directive that are capable of having direct effect may be relied upon include a body, whatever its legal form, which has been made responsible, pursuant to a measure adopted by the State, for providing a public service under the control of the State and has for that purpose special powers beyond those which result from the normal rules applicable in relations between individuals (see, inter alia, Foster and Others, paragraph 20; Collino and Chiappero, paragraph 23; and Case C-356/05 Farrell [2007] ECR I-3067, paragraph 40).
It is therefore for the national court to determine whether Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 may be relied upon against the CICOA.
If that is the case, as Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 fulfils the conditions required to produce a direct effect, the consequence would be that the national court would have to disregard any conflicting national provision.
If that is not the case, it should be borne in mind that even a clear, precise and unconditional provision of a directive seeking to confer rights or impose obligations on individuals cannot of itself apply in proceedings exclusively between private parties (see Pfeiffer and Others, paragraph 109).
In such a situation, the party injured as a result of domestic law not being in conformity with European Union law can none the less rely on the judgment in Joined Cases C-6/90 and C-9/90 Francovich and Others [1991] ECR I-5357 in order to obtain, if appropriate, compensation for the loss sustained.
The answer to the second question is therefore that it is for the national court to determine, taking the whole body of domestic law into consideration, in particular Article L. 223-4 of the Code du travail, and applying the interpretative methods recognised by domestic law, with a view to ensuring that Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 is fully effective and achieving an outcome consistent with the objective pursued by it, whether it can find an interpretation of that law that allows the absence of the worker due to an accident on the journey to or from work to be treated as being equivalent to one of the situations covered by that article of the Code du travail.
If such an interpretation is not possible, it is for the national court to determine whether, in the light of the legal nature of the respondents in the main proceedings, the direct effect of Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 may be relied upon against them.
If the national court is unable to achieve the objective laid down in Article 7 of Directive 2003/88, the party injured as a result of domestic law not being in conformity with European Union law can none the less rely on the judgment in Francovich and Others in order to obtain, if appropriate, compensation for the loss sustained.
By its third question, the national court asks, essentially, whether Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 must be interpreted as precluding a national provision which, depending on the reason for the worker’s absence on sick leave, provides for a period of paid annual leave equal to or exceeding the minimum period of four weeks laid down in that directive.
In that regard, it should be noted, as was held in paragraph 30 above, that Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 does not make any distinction, on grounds of the reason for the worker’s absence on sick leave, duly granted, and any worker, whether he be on sick leave following an accident at his place of work or elsewhere, or as the result of sickness of whatever nature or origin, is entitled to at least four weeks’ paid annual leave.
However, as stated both by the Advocate General in point 178 of her Opinion and by the European Commission in its written observations, the finding made in the preceding paragraph does not mean that Directive 2003/88 precludes national provisions giving entitlement to more than four weeks’ paid annual leave, granted under the conditions for entitlement to, and granting of, the right to paid annual leave laid down by that national law.
As appears expressly from Article 1(1) and (2)(a) and from Articles 7(1) and 15 of Directive 2003/88, the purpose of the directive is merely to lay down minimum safety and health requirements for the organisation of working time and it does not affect Member States’ right to apply national provisions more favourable to the protection of workers.
Thus it is permissible for Member States to provide that entitlement to paid annual leave under national law may vary according to the reason for the worker’s absence on health grounds, provided that the entitlement is always equal to or exceeds the minimum period of four weeks laid down in Article 7 of that directive.
It follows from the foregoing that Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 must be interpreted as not precluding a national provision which, depending on the reason for the worker’s absence on sick leave, provides for a period of paid annual leave equal to or exceeding the minimum period of four weeks laid down in that directive.
Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.
Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.
On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:
Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time must be interpreted as precluding national provisions or practices which make entitlement to paid annual leave conditional on a minimum period of ten days’ or one month’s actual work during the reference period.
It is for the national court to determine, taking the whole body of domestic law into consideration, in particular Article L. 223-4 of the Code du travail, and applying the interpretative methods recognised by domestic law, with a view to ensuring that Article 7 of Directive 2003/88 is fully effective and achieving an outcome consistent with the objective pursued by it, whether it can find an interpretation of that law that allows the absence of the worker due to an accident on the journey to or from work to be treated as being equivalent to one of the situations covered by that article of the Code du travail.
If such an interpretation is not possible, it is for the national court to determine whether, in the light of the legal nature of the respondents in the main proceedings, the direct effect of Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 may be relied upon against them.
If the national court is unable to achieve the objective laid down in Article 7 of Directive 2003/88, the party injured as a result of domestic law not being in conformity with European Union law can none the less rely on the judgment of 19 November 1991 in Joined Cases C-6/90 and C-9/90 Francovich and Others in order to obtain, if appropriate, compensation for the loss sustained.
Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/88 must be interpreted as not precluding a national provision which, depending on the reason for the worker’s absence on sick leave, provides for a period of paid annual leave equal to or exceeding the minimum period of four weeks laid down in that directive.
JUDGMENT OF THE COURT (First Chamber)
February 2012 ( *1 )
THE COURT (First Chamber),
By its application, the European Commission seeks a declaration from the Court that Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools of 21 June 1994 (OJ 1994 L 212, p. 3,’the Convention’) is to be interpreted and applied so as to ensure that teachers seconded by a Member State have access during their secondment to the same progression in status and pay as those enjoyed by teachers employed in that Member State, and that the exclusion of certain teachers seconded by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, during their secondment, from access to improved pay scales (known as ‘threshold pay’, ‘excellent teacher system’ or ‘advanced skills teachers’) and from access to other additional payments (such as ‘teaching and learning responsibility payments’), and also from progression within existing pay scales available to teachers employed in maintained schools in England and Wales, is incompatible with Articles 12(4)(a) and 25(1) of the Convention.
Legal context
The Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools and the Regulations for Members of the Seconded Staff
The European Schools were originally set up by two instruments: the Statute of the European School, signed at Luxembourg on 12 April 1957 (United Nations Treaty Series, Volume 443, p. 129), and the Protocol on the setting-up of European Schools with reference to the Statute of the European School, signed at Luxembourg on 13 April 1962 (United Nations Treaty Series, Volume 752, p. 267).
Those instruments were replaced by the Convention, which entered into force on 1 October 2002 and is the instrument currently applicable.
Unlike the original instruments, to which only the Member States were parties, the Convention was also concluded by the European Communities, which were empowered to do so by Council Decision 94/557/EC, Euratom of 17 June 1994 authorising the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community to sign and conclude the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools (OJ 1994 L 212, p. 1).
The third recital in the preamble to the Convention reads:
Considering that the European School system is “sui generis”; considering that it constitutes a form of cooperation between the Member States and between them and the European Communities while fully acknowledging the Member States’ responsibility for the content of teaching and the organisation of their educational system, and for their cultural and linguistic diversity.
Article (3)2 of that Convention provides:
Instruction shall be provided by teachers seconded or assigned by the Member States in accordance with decisions taken by the Board of Governors under the procedure laid down in Article 12(4).
Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention, which falls within the second title thereof, entitled ‘Organs of the Schools’, provides:
In administrative matters, the Board of Governors shall determine each year, on a proposal from the Boards of Inspectors, the teaching staff requirements by creating or eliminating posts.
It shall ensure a fair allocation of posts among the Member States.
It shall settle with the governments questions relating to the assignment or secondment of the secondary school teachers, primary school teachers and education counsellors of the School.
Staff shall retain promotion and retirement rights guaranteed by their national rules.
Article 25 of the Convention reads as follows:
The budget of the Schools shall be financed by contributions from the Member States through the continuing payment of the remuneration for seconded or assigned teaching staff and, where appropriate, a financial contribution decided on by the Board of Governors acting unanimously; the contribution from the European Communities, which is intended to cover the difference between the total amount of expenditure by the Schools and the total of other revenue; contributions from non-Community organisations with which the Board of Governors has concluded an Agreement; the School’s own revenue, notably the school fees charged to parents by the Board of Governors; miscellaneous revenue.
The arrangements for making available the contribution from the European Communities shall be laid down in a special agreement between the Board of Governors and the Commission.
Under Article 26 of the Convention, ‘the Court of Justice of the European Communities shall have sole jurisdiction in disputes between Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation and application of this Convention which have not been resolved by the Board of Governors.’
On the basis of Article 12(1) of the Convention, the Board of Governors adopted the Regulations for Members of the Seconded Staff of the European Schools (‘the regulations for seconded staff’), these contain, inter alia, provisions on the remuneration and conditions of employment of the teaching staff of the European Schools.
Article 10(1) of the regulations for seconded staff requires seconded teachers to have the qualifications and meet the conditions necessary for an equivalent post in their country of origin.
Chapter III of the regulations, entitled ‘Performance Evaluation’, contains Article 30, which provides, in its first paragraph, that ‘the ability, efficiency and conduct in the service of each member of the teaching and supervisory staff and of Deputy Directors shall be the subject of a performance evaluation report drawn up by both the Director and the national Inspector, in accordance with the arrangements laid down in the Implementing Regulations.‘
In the event of disagreement, the Inspector’s report shall preponderate.
Under Article 49 of the regulations, teachers on secondment receive their national salary, paid by the competent national authorities, and also receive the difference between the remuneration as laid down in the regulations and the exchange value of their national salary, less compulsory social security deductions, which is paid by the European School (‘the European supplement’).
Under Article 72(1) of the regulations for seconded staff, members of staff whose service terminates are entitled, on leaving — provided that they leave for reasons other than disciplinary action — to the payment of a severance grant proportionate to the length of actual service, up to a maximum of nine years.
However, the regulations make no provision for the retirement of seconded teachers, who continue to contribute to their national schemes during their secondment.
The rules applicable to teachers serving in England and Wales.
In the United Kingdom, education is a decentralised matter, split between three separate jurisdictions, namely England and Wales, which together form a single jurisdiction, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.
The terms of employment are different in each of those jurisdictions.
For the jurisdiction comprising England and Wales, which is the only relevant jurisdiction for the purposes of the present case, the majority of teachers are employed by maintained schools.
The salaries and conditions of employment of those teachers are determined by order of the competent minister in the ‘School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document’ (‘STPCD’), which is binding in relation to any contract of employment concluded by a maintained school.
Some teachers are employed not in maintained schools but in other types of school, such as independent, mixed-ability State schools supported by sponsors (‘academies’), private schools, the European School in Culham and schools run by foreign governments.
For such schools, the terms and conditions of employment laid down in the STPCD are optional.
The STPCD of 2009 sets out the pay scales, the key features of which are as follows.
There is a basic salary scale for classroom teachers, which has six points.
The main criterion for moving up this pay scale is the level of experience measured in completed years of teaching.
Thus, leaving aside exceptional cases where the results achieved are unsatisfactory, progression up this scale is automatic.
In 2000, a 3% salary increase was granted in England and Wales and at the same time, a pay rise of 7% was granted in that jurisdiction on the basis of a new scheme entitled ‘threshold pay’, for which teachers had to meet certain conditions in order to qualify.
Under this scheme, teachers in England and Wales may, when they reach the threshold level at the top of the basic scale, apply to cross the threshold into the higher salary scale (‘post threshold pay scale’).
Teachers wishing to make such an application must satisfy certain professional standards, provide evidence of their qualifications and request an assessment of their abilities, which is carried out by the head teacher.
The professional standards to be met are set out in a document entitled ‘Professional Standards for Teachers’.
Once a teacher has crossed the threshold into the higher scale (‘post-threshold teacher’), progress up that scale is not automatic but is subject to the conclusions of an annual review meeting.
In the case of maintained schools, the STPCD also provides for the possibility of creating posts for ‘excellent teachers’ and ‘advanced skills teachers’, for which there are special salary scales, and posts entitling teachers to ‘teaching and learning responsibility payments’.
Teachers may not occupy more than one of these posts at the same time.
Teachers wishing to join the excellent teacher scheme must have been placed at the highest of the three levels of the post-threshold pay scale for at least two years and possess specific professional abilities as laid down in the Professional Standards for Teachers.
However, they may apply for assessment in this connection only in relation to a vacancy for an excellent teacher post in their own school.
In addition to their normal classroom duties, excellent teachers have to help other teachers to improve their effectiveness and the quality of their teaching.
In order to be eligible for an advanced skills teacher post, candidates need not necessarily have attained the post-threshold pay scale, but must nevertheless meet post-threshold teacher standards and, in particular, the special professional performance standards for advanced skills teachers, as laid down in the Professional Standards for Teachers.
Assessments in this connection are carried out by external assessors.
These posts entail additional responsibilities, which are carried out for the benefit of teachers from other schools.
Finally, teaching and learning responsibility payments are available to all teachers carrying out normal classroom duties, whether or not they have attained the post-threshold pay scale.
These additional payments are awarded to teachers who take on ‘sustained additional responsibility in the context of [the school’s] staffing structure’.
They are intended to reward support given to pupils outside the class or leadership in subject or curriculum area development.
The scheme applicable to teachers seconded to the European Schools from England and Wales.
The UK posts in the European Schools are open to all suitably qualified teachers irrespective of whether, at the time of their secondment or assignment, they are employed in a maintained school, in the private sector, or in schools outside the UK, or indeed even if they are not employed in a teaching job.
Teachers seconded by the United Kingdom to the European Schools do not retain their contractual relationship with their previous employer but enter into a new contract of employment with the Department for Children, Schools and Families (‘the Ministry of Education’) for the purpose of the secondment.
This contract of employment stipulates, as regards English and Welsh teachers, that the STPCD does not apply to teachers in the European Schools.
It nevertheless provides that the national salaries paid monthly to seconded teachers are fixed in line with the basic salary scale laid down in the STPCD and that they are entitled to the annual nationally negotiated pay increases applicable under the STPCD.
It further states that no other increases in national salary will be paid and that a seconded teacher may not, during his secondment to a European School, apply to be paid on a higher salary scale or for any additional allowance or status referred to in the STPCD.
Lastly, the contract of employment specifies that employment in a European School is pensionable under the Teachers’ Pension Scheme for England and Wales and that contributions are based on national salary only.
The precontentious consultations
Following a large number of complaints by the teachers concerned and several parliamentary questions, the Commission has repeatedly raised this issue with successive Secretaries of State responsible for education in the United Kingdom at various times from 2000 onwards, arguing that the decision that British teachers seconded to the European Schools were not entitled to the higher performance-related pay scales was incompatible with the Convention.
An initial exchange of letters in 2000 and 2001 and a further exchange of letters in 2007 failed to resolve the difficulty.
The Commission then requested that the matter be discussed at the meeting of the Board of Governors of 20 to 22 October 2008.
On 20 November 2008 a videoconference took place between representatives of the Commission and the Ministry of Education, which once again failed to resolve the dispute.
On 13 January 2009, the Commission made a final request to the Board of Governors with a view to resolving the situation, while announcing that, if there were no result, it would have to make an application to the Court.
The interpretation of Articles 12(4)(a) and 25(1) of the Convention was considered at the meeting of the Board of Governors of 20 and 21 January 2009.
Following that meeting, the Board of Governors concluded that it ‘was unable to resolve this dispute and took formal note of the Commission’s intention of requesting the Court of Justice for a ruling on interpretation and application of the said articles and of bringing an action against the United Kingdom on the basis of Article 26 of the Convention in liaison with Articles 10 and 39 of the Treaty’.
It was against that background that the Commission brought the present action.
By its action, the Commission asks the Court to rule, under Article 26 of the Convention, on the interpretation to be given to the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of that Convention and to rule, also, as to whether the United Kingdom is applying that provision correctly, as regards teachers seconded to the European Schools from England and Wales specifically, and is thus complying with the obligations arising under that provision and under Article 25(1) of that Convention.
The interpretation of the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention.
The Commission submits that the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention imposes an obligation on the Member States to ensure that teachers on secondment retain promotion and retirement rights guaranteed by their national rules.
That Convention therefore confers a right to that effect on teachers on secondment.
That interpretation is confirmed by the clear and unconditional wording, the context and the objective of the provision, which is to ensure that teachers are not penalised as a result of their secondment.
The Commission also submits that the word ‘promotion’ calls for an independent interpretation and is intended to cover the different national systems of remuneration applicable to teachers in the event of secondment.
Thus, the broad meaning of the term is confirmed by analysis of the various linguistic versions.
The United Kingdom, in contrast, takes the view that Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention is addressed only to the Board of Governors, and thus does not impose any obligation on the Member States.
That interpretation is borne out, first, by the wording of that provision, which is part of the second Title of the Convention, headed ‘Organs of the Schools’, no provision of which imposes obligations on the Member States, and, second, by the reference made in Article 3(2) of the Convention to Article 12 thereof.
According to the United Kingdom, the effect of Article 12(4) is to require the Board of Governors, when exercising administrative functions, to respect national rules regarding promotion and retirement.
Indeed, there would be little sense in the argument that the Convention imposed an obligation on Member States to respect their own national rules.
Moreover, it would be contrary to Article 165(1) TFEU, which preserves the autonomy of the Member States in organising their educational systems, for the Convention to impose an obligation on Member States to confer rights on teachers seconded or assigned to the European Schools to which they are not entitled under national rules.
Furthermore, that Member State submits that, according to the usual understanding in the United Kingdom of the term ‘promotion’, it ordinarily refers only to the advancement of a teacher to more senior administrative positions with more responsibilities within the management structure of a school, such as head teacher or deputy head teacher.
 As regards the terms, ‘promotion … rights guaranteed’ by the national rules, the United Kingdom essentially argues that those terms must be given a strict, literal interpretation.
Thus, a promotion which is not automatically granted on the basis of seniority but which must be applied for by the teacher, who will not be promoted unless he satisfies a certain number of criteria, does not constitute a right guaranteed by national rules.
Findings of the Court
The dispute between the Commission and the United Kingdom as to the interpretation to be given to the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention essentially turns on two questions: the first, whether that provision entails an obligation on the Member States party to that Convention and the second, the scope to be attributed to the terms ‘promotion … rights guaranteed by … national rules’.
As regards the first of those two questions, it must, first, be recalled that Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention provides that the Board of Governors is to determine each year, on a proposal from the Boards of Inspectors, the teaching staff requirements by creating or eliminating posts.
It is to ensure a fair allocation of posts among the Member States.
It is to settle with the governments questions relating to the assignment or secondment of the secondary school teachers, primary school teachers and education counsellors of the School.
Staff are to retain promotion and retirement rights guaranteed by their national rules.
It thus follows from the wording of that provision that, while the first three sentences place the burden of responsibilities on the Board of Governors, and those responsibilities must be discharged, where appropriate, in collaboration with the governments, its last sentence is worded neutrally, recording the right of teachers to retain their promotion and retirement rights guaranteed by their national rules, without specifying by whom those rights must be guaranteed.
However, it is clear that those rights could not be guaranteed if the Member States party to the Convention were free to organise their national rules and the provisions governing the assignment or secondment of their teachers to a European School in a way that would deprive those teachers of those rights during the assignment or secondment.
In that regard, it must be pointed out that the promotion and retirement rights of the teachers assigned or seconded to European Schools are entirely governed by the national legislation of the States concerned and that it is, consequently, impossible for the Board of Governors to ensure that those rights are retained where that legislation does not allow them to be retained.
Moreover, while the Board of Governors is required to respect that legislation, the fact remains that, first, the application of that legislation to those teachers does not require any intervention on the part of the Board and, second, it is hardly conceivable that the Board could affect the promotion and retirement rights granted to those teachers by their national legislation, given that its powers are limited and strictly defined by the Convention.
Against that background, it must be held that the interpretation proposed by the United Kingdom, to the effect that the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention is addressed exclusively to the Board of Governors so as to oblige it to respect national legislation as regards promotion and retirement, would deprive that provision of any meaningful effect.
It follows that, contrary to the contention of the United Kingdom, that provision must be interpreted as meaning that it also entails an obligation on the Member States party to the Convention to ensure that teachers retain the promotion and retirement rights guaranteed by their national rules during their assignment or secondment to the European Schools.
That finding is undermined neither by the fact that Article 12 of the Convention is part of the second Title, headed ‘Organs of the Schools’ and that it lists the responsibilities of the Board of Governors in administrative matters nor by the reference made in Article 3(2) of the Convention to Article 12.
Although it is common ground that Article 12 principally states the responsibilities falling on the Board of Governors, it must none the less be pointed out that that article also refers, in the penultimate sentence of paragraph (4)(a), to ‘governments’ and that the last sentence of that provision is worded, as noted in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, not as a responsibility of the Board of Governors, but as an unconditional right of teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools.
Moreover, the placing of that sentence is explained by historical reasons and by the inherent link between the subject-matter of that sentence and that of the preceding sentence.
It is clear from that earlier version of the Statute that the Board of Governors and the governments were jointly to determine questions relating to secondment and assignment so as to ensure that teachers were not disadvantaged as a result of their secondment or their assignment to a European School.
Although the Convention, in its current version, further increases the protection of teachers by conferring on them an express and unconditional right, it is in no way intended to release governments from their obligation in that regard.
Contrary to what the United Kingdom appears to suggest, that obligation is not, moreover, deprived of purpose by the fact that the Member States are bound to respect their own legislation.
It follows from the preceding paragraphs that the responsibility of the Member States party to the Convention to achieve the objective in the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) entails not only the obligation to respect the national legislation on promotion and retirement rights but also the obligation to ensure that that legislation is structured so as not to exclude teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools.
Such an obligation is not, moreover, incompatible with Article 165 TFEU.
First, the limitation of the competences of the European Union as regards education laid down in that article does not concern the Convention given that it is not secondary legislation adopted by the bodies of the Union but an instrument of international law concluded between the Member States of the European Communities.
Second, and insofar as the third recital in the preamble to the Convention also states that this ‘sui generis’ system of cooperation between the Member States and the European Communities acknowledges the Member States’ responsibility for the organisation of their educational systems, it must be held that this responsibility is in no way affected by the obligation of the Member States not to penalise teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools as regards promotion and retirement rights.
As regards the second question of interpretation on which the parties disagree and which concerns the scope of the terms ‘promotion … rights guaranteed’ by national rules, appearing in the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention, it must be pointed out that that scope, and thus the protection granted by that provision to teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools, may not differ according to their place of origin and that those terms, therefore, require an independent interpretation.
Such an interpretation must, inter alia, allow the objective of that provision actually to be achieved and must therefore ensure that teachers do not suffer disadvantages as regards promotion or retirement as a result of their assignment or secondment to a European School.
As regards, more specifically, the term ‘promotion’ (‘avancement’ in French), it must be held that, in the light of that objective, that term cannot be given the restrictive interpretation proposed by the United Kingdom.
As the Advocate General pointed out in points 45 and 46 of his opinion, the term refers not only to a teacher’s access to posts at a higher level in the hierarchy of a school, entailing additional responsibility, such as that of head teacher, but also to any career progression.
It thus also covers access to grades within a career structure, entailing a better salary but not implying the award of a different title or additional responsibilities.
Similarly, contrary to what the United Kingdom seems to suggest, it cannot be inferred from the terms ‘promotion … rights guaranteed’ by national rules that they are, as a matter of principle, only intended to refer to situations in which the national rules provide for automatic promotion on the basis of seniority
As the Advocate General indicated in points 53 to 55 of his opinion, it follows from the wording and the purpose of the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention that that provision seeks to safeguard, for teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools, all the rights relating to career progression as laid down by the respective national rules, regardless of the form those rights take.
Thus, depending on the content of the rights awarded by those rules, they may take the form of an automatic right to promotion or merely a right to take part in procedures for access to career progression.
However, those rights cannot have a less extensive scope than those which those teachers would have enjoyed if they had remained in their post in a school in their Member State of origin.
It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) must be interpreted as meaning that it requires the Member States party to that Convention to ensure that teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools enjoy, during their secondment or assignment, the same rights to career progression and retirement as those applicable to their national counterparts under the legislation of their Member State of origin.
The application by the United Kingdom of the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) and Article 25(1) of the Convention.
Arguments of the parties
The Commission submits that the contract of employment which teachers seconded from England and Wales must enter into with the Ministry of Education for the purposes of their secondment to the European Schools freezes their salary at the moment of secondment for the duration of their secondment, excluding them from eligibility for any of the higher pay scales and the teaching and learning responsibility payments laid down in the STPCD and that this situation is inconsistent with Articles 12(4)(a) and 25(1) of the Convention.
First, there is the disadvantage for potential candidates of not being able to take part in an assessment which would allow them to access the post-threshold pay scale while seconded.
Because of this, when they return to the United Kingdom after their secondment, they can only apply for a job on the basic pay scale, which limits the range of posts they can apply for.
Secondly, their non-eligibility for any allowances and promotions during a nine-year secondment significantly reduces the salary taken into account for the calculation of their pension rights and thus the amount of their future pension.
Furthermore, the Commission complains that this exclusion entails a significant financial loss to the Union budget, since it has to bear a larger difference between the lower national salary and the harmonised salary under the regulations for seconded staff.
It estimates, on the basis of a rough calculation, that the Union budget had to bear in 2008 an additional cost of some EUR 720 000 simply for the 194 teachers seconded from England and Wales.
That cost flowed from the higher differential that had to be paid under Article 49(2)(b) of the regulations for seconded staff and, in consequence, under Article 25(2) of the Convention.
On the basis of that calculation, it might reasonably be supposed that the inability of teachers seconded from England and Wales to attain the post-threshold pay scale in itself entails an additional cost to the Union budget of between EUR 500 000 and 1 000 000.
The Commission emphasises that it does not claim that teachers seconded from England and Wales should automatically move to and progress through the higher salary scales provided for post-threshold teachers, advanced teachers and excellent teachers, or receive teaching and learning responsibility payments.
Its claim is simply that such teachers should have the same access to progression on the pay scale as any teacher employed in the United Kingdom and that they should therefore be able to participate in the assessment procedures for access to those salary scales.
According to the Commission, a detailed analysis of the various professional standards and tasks to which those salary scales and increments relate reveals that teachers seconded to the European Schools frequently carry out duties which make them in principle eligible to progress to such pay scales and benefit from such increments.
The Commission maintains that the United Kingdom cannot rely on alleged technical difficulties to justify its failure to fulfil its obligations under the Convention.
Moreover, it disputes that such difficulties really exist or that they could not be resolved by making an effort proportionate to the interests in issue.
In so far as concerns, first of all, organising the assessment of teachers on secondment, the Commission observes, first, that assessments for the purposes of access to the post-threshold pay scale are carried out by the head teachers of local schools and that there is prima facie no reason why the head teacher of the European School could not be entrusted with the threshold assessment.
Secondly, there appear to be several options.
For instance, the United Kingdom could send inspectors to verify the assessments carried out by the head teachers of the European Schools, or send external assessors to carry out the assessment themselves, or choose an appropriate combination of these possible solutions.
Finally, there is no reason why assessors from the national agency which carries out the assessments of national candidates for posts for advanced skills teachers and excellent teachers could not visit the European Schools, given that they already assess Ministry of Defence Schools in Germany and other countries outside the United Kingdom.
As regards, second, the United Kingdom’s argument that access to the higher pay scales depends on the creation of posts, the Commission asserts that this is not the case for access to the post-threshold pay scale, the introduction of which essentially constitutes a disguised general pay rise.
Access to the other upper pay scales entails the creation of new posts in the budgetary sense.
However, nothing prevents the United Kingdom from giving the Ministry of Education the appropriate number of posts for advanced skills teachers and excellent teachers for teachers on secondment.
The United Kingdom dismisses the argument that its policy with regard to seconded teachers is contrary to Articles 12(4)(a) and 25 of the Convention.
The United Kingdom submits that the Commission’s action is premised on misconceptions with regard to the employment status of teachers on secondment and the nature of the additional payments provided for by the STPCD.
In this connection that Member State emphasises, in particular, that English and Welsh teachers on secondment do not necessarily come from maintained schools and consequently may not have been subject to the STPCD before their secondment, the STPCD does not therefore constitute the ‘national rules’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Convention.
Furthermore, English and Welsh teachers on secondment have chosen to leave their previous position of employment in order to take up a new post in a European School on the basis of a new contract of employment with the Ministry of Education.
That contract actually states that a teacher on secondment may not apply for any additional scale or for any additional allowance covered by the STPCD.
Those teachers have thus chosen to accept a post to which the STPCD does not apply.
For the rest, the United Kingdom argues that the additional payments provided for by the STPCD are not ‘guaranteed’ by the national rules and do not constitute promotion ‘rights’ within the meaning of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention.
The payments are not automatically granted on the basis of seniority, but must be applied for and are granted only when certain criteria are met.
Further, teaching and learning responsibility payments and the advanced skills teachers and excellent teachers schemes are only available to the extent that individual schools decide to create posts which carry those additional payments.
Moreover, the additional payments are not promotions within the meaning of that article, given that teachers who are awarded additional pay in return for undertaking additional responsibilities retain their position as ‘teacher’ and are not promoted to any higher ranking position.
The United Kingdom submits that, if teachers on secondment were to be entitled to additional payments without being obliged to perform the additional responsibilities that go with them, that would create discrimination in their favour to the detriment of ‘home’ teachers.
The United Kingdom disputes, in particular, that teachers on secondment meet the criteria for the award of the additional payments.
It maintains that there is no real equivalence between the circumstances of teachers at the European Schools and those of teachers in maintained schools in the United Kingdom who are subject to the STPDC.
Such discrimination would also arise from the fact that the performance review of teachers in the European Schools is not as strict and rigorous as the national system.
The Commission’s proposed solution of sending inspectors from the United Kingdom to review performance in the European Schools would not achieve the same result.
Finally, in so far as concerns Article 25 of the Convention, the United Kingdom maintains that even if its interpretation of the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) were to prove incorrect, that would not mean that the Union budget has suffered any particular loss.
Admittedly, it is possible that some teachers could acquire the right to additional payments in the future if they make an appropriate application and are approved.
However, insofar as the award of that right would depend upon an individual assessment of each teacher, none of those teachers could claim it at present.
The United Kingdom has thus so far fulfilled its obligation under the Convention to pay all teachers’ remuneration due to teachers on secondment.
Findings of the Court
In essence, the Commission alleges that the United Kingdom has failed to ensure that teachers assigned by that Member State to European Schools retain promotion and retirement rights guaranteed by their national rules in accordance with Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention and, consequently, that it has not continued payment of the remuneration to those teachers, in contravention of Article 25(1) of the Convention.
In order to assess the merits of that complaint, it must first be established whether the STPCD constitutes, for those teachers, the national rules within the meaning of the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of that Convention.
In that regard, it must be noted that, although the Member States party to the Convention remain, as the third recital in the preamble to the Convention recalls, fully responsible for the organisation of their education system, they cannot rely on particular features of that system to evade the obligations deriving from that Convention and to deprive the teachers that they assign or second to the European Schools of the protection provided for by the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of that Convention.
However, that would be precisely the implication of the argument put forward by the United Kingdom that the STPCD does not constitute national rules within the meaning of that provision, for English and Welsh teachers.
According to that provision, given the particular features of the education system of that Member State, there are quite simply no national rules for that system.
Moreover, it must be pointed out that the STPCD is compulsory for all maintained schools in England and Wales and that the majority of teachers employed there are actually employed in such schools, but also that, even amongst non-maintained schools, a good number apply the STPCD in part or in full.
The Commission has stated in that regard, without being contradicted on that point by the United Kingdom, that the non-maintained schools which apply the STPCD only in part in fact use the conditions laid down in it as a minimum and add additional benefits, and that, in practice, the STPCD applies to 90% of all teachers employed in that Member State.
Moreover, the standard employment contract which teachers assigned or seconded from England and Wales to the European Schools sign with the Ministry of Education for the purposes of that assignment or secondment provides that the national salaries paid monthly to those teachers are fixed in accordance with salary scales laid down by the STPCD and that annual salary increases negotiated at national level, applicable under the STPCD, are paid.
It is thus common ground that even for those teachers, working conditions are partially governed by the STPCD and that the contract excludes its application only selectively, and in particular as regards the benefit of a higher salary scale and an additional allowance.
It must be held that, in those circumstances, the STPCD constitutes the national rules within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention for English and Welsh teachers.
As regards the argument of the United Kingdom that it cannot be obliged to grant the rights to promotion provided for by the STPCD to all the teachers which it assigns or seconds to the European Schools, since only some of them were employed, before their assignment or secondment, in a maintained school in England or Wales, it must be observed that the Commission claims, in the present proceedings, that the rights provided for by the STPCD should be applied, not to all teachers assigned or seconded by that Member State, but only to those from England or Wales.
Consequently, the fact that the STPCD does not apply to teachers employed, for example, in Scotland is of no relevance in this action.
For the rest, since not only maintained schools in England and Wales but also a large proportion of the non-maintained schools apply the STPCD in part or in full, it may be presumed that, of the English and Welsh teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools, a majority enjoyed the conditions provided for by the SPTCD before their assignment or secondment.
Even if it were to appear that some of those teachers were not covered by the STPCD because they were previously employed either by a non-maintained school which did not avail itself of the option of applying the STPCD, or by another school, that fact cannot, in any event, justify the United Kingdom’s excluding, on the basis of the standard contract which teachers must sign for the purposes of their assignment or secondment to the European Schools, the application of certain benefits provided for by the STPCD for all English and Welsh teachers.
Moreover, contrary to the United Kingdom’s contention, such exclusion is not justified by the mere fact that those teachers sign that contract voluntarily and in full knowledge of the situation.
While it is true that those teachers are in no way obliged to ask to be assigned or seconded to a European School and are in a position to be aware of the conditions of the new employment contract, the fact remains that those teachers have no choice but to sign that contract, the conditions of which are imposed on them by the Ministry of Education.
If the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention is not to be deprived of meaningful effect, it cannot validly be argued that, in such circumstances, the teachers have intentionally foregone the benefits provided for by the STPCD and the right granted them by that provision of the Convention.
As regards, next, the question whether access to the more advantageous pay scales such as the post-threshold pay scale and the scales applying to excellent teachers and advanced skills teachers and access to other additional payments such as the teaching and learning responsibility payments provided for by the STPCD constitute promotion rights within the meaning of that provision, it must be recalled that it has already been held in paragraphs 54 and 55 of this judgment that rights which entail more advantageous remuneration without that advantage being linked to the award of a different title to the teacher, and those which are not conferred automatically on the basis of seniority but require the teacher to take part in procedures and meet certain criteria also constitute such rights.
It follows that the arguments of the United Kingdom based on the fact that the teachers to whom those scales and payments apply retain their position and had to submit to such procedures must be rejected.
Moreover, the Commission maintains, not that the teachers assigned or seconded from England and Wales should automatically benefit from those scales and payments, but that they must have access to them under the same conditions as those applying to English and Welsh teachers subject to the STPCD.
Although the United Kingdom submits that assigned or seconded teachers cannot, as a matter of principle, meet the professional standards on the basis of which access to those salary scales is granted and the additional responsibilities linked to the application of certain of those scales and payments, it must be pointed out that the Commission made a detailed analysis of those criteria and those responsibilities, explaining plausibly that a large number of those teachers meet those standards and bear equivalent responsibilities within the European Schools.
That analysis and those explanations are not called into question by the specific arguments put forward by the United Kingdom, according to which, essentially, there is no real equivalence between the position of teachers in the European Schools and the position of their national counterparts.
That assertion is contradicted by Article 10 of the regulations for seconded staff which requires assigned or seconded teachers to possess the qualifications and meet the conditions necessary to occupy equivalent posts in their countries of origin.
Moreover, insofar as the arguments of the United Kingdom are based on the notion that those standards and responsibilities could not, by definition, be met by those teachers given that the European Schools do not operate in the same way as maintained schools in England and Wales, they misconstrue the particular status and sui generis nature of the European Schools.
Contrary to the United Kingdom’s contention, the access of teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools from England and Wales to those salary scales and additional payments would not entail discrimination to the detriment of their national counterparts on the ground that it would be impossible to ensure assessment of the professional competence of such teachers which was as precise and rigorous as that carried out at national level.
As the Advocate General pointed out in points 87 to 90 of his opinion, there is no basis for that argument since there are perfectly viable solutions enabling such assessments to be carried out.
Moreover, the United Kingdom did not explain the reasons why it considers that the various options proposed by the Commission in that connection would not allow a satisfactory result to be achieved, but confined itself to stating that it was not sufficient to send national inspectors into the European Schools.
The United Kingdom also submits that many teachers in maintained schools in England and Wales do not benefit from the salary scales for excellent teachers and advanced skills teachers or teaching and learning responsibility payments because no or very few posts giving rise to entitlement to those scales and payments have been created in their schools.
However, that fact does not justify excluding all English and Welsh teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools from the benefit of those scales and payments.
Moreover, in response to the Commission’s request for the allocation to the European Schools of a number of such posts proportional to that in England and Wales, the United Kingdom did not dispute that such an allocation was actually possible, but stated that the number of posts allocated to the European Schools would then be very low, or non-existent, and that it would accordingly be difficult to determine the European Schools which should actually be given such posts.
However, such practical difficulties in the distribution of posts giving rise to entitlement to those scales and payments cannot justify the blanket refusal to allocate such posts to the European Schools.
It is, moreover, common ground that, under the penultimate sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention, the United Kingdom could have the assistance of the Board of Governors to resolve those difficulties in order, inter alia, to identify within the European Schools posts for excellent teachers and advanced skills teachers.
Finally, as to whether the United Kingdom is applying Article 25(1) of the Convention correctly, it must be recalled that that provision requires the Member States to contribute to the budget of the European Schools by continuing to pay the remuneration of the teachers they second or assign to those schools.
According to paragraph 2 of that article, in conjunction with Article 49 of the regulations for seconded staff, the Union contributes to that budget by paying the European supplement.
In that regard, the Commission, without being contradicted on that point by the United Kingdom, put forward figures which demonstrated plausibly that the freezing of the remuneration of English and Welsh teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools resulted in the Union having to pay a higher European supplement to those teachers, which entailed an increase in the annual contribution of the Union to the budget of those schools.
That finding is not undermined by the argument of the United Kingdom that access to the higher salary scales and the additional payments depends on an individual assessment of each teacher, which has not yet been made in the case of English and Welsh teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools.
That argument clearly disregards the fact that, first, such assessments have not yet been made precisely because of the systematic exclusion of those teachers from the scales and payments in question and, second, it may reasonably be presumed that, in the absence of such exclusion, some of those teachers would in fact already have been awarded those scales and those payments.
It follows that, insofar as the correct interpretation and the correct application of the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention by the United Kingdom would have resulted in a higher contribution by that Member State to the budget of the European Schools, there is at least an indirect link between the breach of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention and the obligation incumbent on the Member States under Article 25(1) of that Convention, a link which was, moreover, not disputed by the United Kingdom.
Consequently, by preventing those teachers from applying for one of the higher salary scales or benefiting from the teaching and learning responsibility payments the United Kingdom has also breached Article 25(1) of the Convention.
In the light of all those considerations, it must be held that, by excluding English and Welsh teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools, during their assignment or secondment, from access to the higher salary scales, in particular those known as ‘threshold pay’, ‘excellent teacher system’ or ‘advanced skills teachers’ and from access to additional payments, such as ‘teaching and learning responsibility payments’, provided for by the STPCD, the United Kingdom has applied Articles 12(4)(a) and 25(1) of the Convention incorrectly.
Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.
Since the Commission has applied for costs and the United Kingdom has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs.
On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby:
Declares that the last sentence of Article 12(4)(a) of the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools of 21 June 1994 must be interpreted as meaning that it requires the Member States party to that Convention to ensure that teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools enjoy, during their secondment or assignment, the same rights to career progression and retirement as those applicable to their national counterparts under the legislation of their Member State of origin.
Declares that by excluding English and Welsh teachers assigned or seconded to the European Schools, during their assignment or secondment, from access to the higher salary scales, in particular those known as ‘threshold pay’, ‘excellent teacher system’ or ‘advanced skills teachers’ and from access to additional payments, such as ‘teaching and learning responsibility payments’, provided for by the ‘School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document’, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has applied Articles 12(4)(a) and 25(1) of the Convention incorrectly.
Orders the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to pay the costs.
THE COURT (Grand Chamber),
After hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 19 April 2012, gives the following Judgment.
This request has been made in proceedings between, on the one hand, Mr Križan and 43 other appellants, natural persons, residents of the town of Pezinok, as well as Mesto Pezinok (town of Pezinok), and, on the other, the Slovenská inšpekcia životného prostredia (Slovak Environment Inspection; ‘the inšpekcia’) concerning the lawfulness of decisions of the administrative authority authorising the construction and operation by Ekologická skládka as (‘Ekologická skládka’), the intervener in the main proceedings, of a landfill site for waste.

European Union law
Article 1(2) of Directive 85/337 defines the concept of ‘development consent’ as ‘the decision of the competent authority or authorities which entitles the developer to proceed with the project.
Article 2 of Directive 85/337 is drafted in the following terms.
Member States shall adopt all measures necessary to ensure that, before consent is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter alia, of their nature, size or location are made subject to a requirement for development consent and an assessment with regard to their effects. Those projects are defined in Article 4.
The environmental impact assessment may be integrated into the existing procedures for consent to projects in the Member States, or, failing this, into other procedures or into procedures to be established to comply with the aims of this Directive.
Recital 23 in the preamble to Directive 96/61 states.
In order to inform the public of the operation of installations and their potential effect on the environment, and in order to ensure the transparency of the licensing process throughout the Community, the public must have access, before any decision is taken, to information relating to applications for permits for new installations.
Article 1 of that directive, entitled ‘Purpose and scope’, provides the purpose of this Directive is to achieve integrated prevention and control of pollution arising from the activities listed in Annex I.
It lays down measures designed to prevent or, where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions in the air, water and land from the abovementioned activities, including measures concerning waste, in order to achieve a high level of protection of the environment taken as a whole, without prejudice to Directive [85/337] and other relevant Community provisions.
Article 15 of Directive 96/61, entitled ‘Access to information and public participation in the permit procedure’, provides:
Member States shall ensure that the public concerned are given early and effective opportunities to participate in the procedure for issuing a permit for new installations.
The procedure set out in Annex V shall apply for the purposes of such participation.

Article 15a of Directive 96/61, entitled ‘Access to justice’, reads as follows:
Member States shall ensure that, in accordance with the relevant national legal system, members of the public concerned have access to a review procedure before a court of law or another independent and impartial body established by law to challenge the substantive or procedural legality of decisions, acts or omissions subject to the public participation provisions of this Directive.
Any such procedure shall be fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive.
Annex I to Directive 96/61, entitled ‘Categories of industrial activities referred to in Article 1’, refers, in paragraph 5.4, to ‘[l]andfills receiving more than 10 tonnes per day or with a total capacity exceeding 25000 tonnes, excluding landfills of inert waste.’
Annex V to Directive 96/61, entitled ‘Public participation in decision-making’, provides, inter alia: The public shall be informed (by public notices or other appropriate means such as electronic media where available) of the following matters early in the procedure for the taking of a decision or, at the latest, as soon as the information can reasonably be provided.
Details of the competent authorities responsible for taking the decision, those from which relevant information can be obtained, those to which comments or questions can be submitted, and details of the time schedule for transmitting comments or questions.
An indication of the times and places where, or means by which, the relevant information will be made available.
Recital 16 in the preamble to Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313 (OJ 2003 L 41, p. 26) is drafted in the following terms: The right to information means that the disclosure of information should be the general rule and that public authorities should be permitted to refuse a request for environmental information in specific and clearly defined cases.
Grounds for refusal should be interpreted in a restrictive way, whereby the public interest served by disclosure should be weighed against the interest served by the refusal.
The reasons for a refusal should be provided to the applicant within the time-limit laid down in this Directive.
Article 4(2) and (4) of that directive provides, inter alia: Member States may provide for a request for environmental information to be refused if disclosure of the information would adversely affect:
The confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided for by national or Community law to protect a legitimate economic interest, including the public interest in maintaining statistical confidentiality and tax secrecy.
The grounds for refusal mentioned [in, inter alia, paragraph 2] shall be interpreted in a restrictive way, taking into account for the particular case the public interest served by disclosure.
In every particular case, the public interest served by disclosure shall be weighed against the interest served by the refusal.
Environmental information held by or for public authorities which has been requested by an applicant shall be made available in part where it is possible to separate out any information falling within the scope of paragraphs 1(d) and (e) or 2 from the rest of the information requested.’
Recital 5 in the preamble to Directive 2003/35 provides that European Union law should be properly aligned with the Aarhus Convention with a view to its ratification.

Procedural rules
Article 135(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:
The court is also bound by the decisions of the Ustavný súd Slovenskej republiky or the European Court of Human Rights which affect fundamental rights and freedoms.
Paragraph 56(6) of Law No 38/1993 Z.z. on the organisation, the rules of procedure and the status of judges of the Ustavný súd Slovenskej republiky, in the version applicable to the facts in the main proceedings, provides:
If the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky annuls a decision, a measure or other valid action and refers the case, the body which, in that case, adopted the decision, took the measure or the action, is required to re-examine the case and to rule afresh.
In that procedure or step, it is bound by the judicial position of the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky.
The provisions on environmental impact assessments, urban planning rules and integrated permits
Paragraph 1(1) of Law No 24/2006 Z.z. on environmental impact assessments and amending several laws, in the version applicable to the facts in the main proceedings, states:
The present law governs: the evaluation process, by professionals and by the public, of the alleged impact on the environment of planned activities before the adoption of the decision on their location or before their authorisation under the specific legislation.
Paragraph 37 of that law provides:
The period of validity of the final opinion concerning an activity is three years from its issue.
The final opinion shall maintain its validity if, during that period, a location procedure or a procedure for a permit for the activity is initiated under the specific legislation.
The validity of the final opinion concerning an activity may be extended by a renewable period of two years at the request of the applicant if he adduces written evidence that the planned activity and the conditions of the land have not undergone substantial changes, that no new circumstance connected to the material content of the assessment report of the activity has arisen and that new technologies used to proceed with the planned activity have not been developed.
The decision to extend the validity of the final opinion concerning the activity reverts to the competent body.
Paragraph 65(5) of that law provides:
If the final opinion was issued before 1 February 2006 and if the procedure for the authorisation of the activity subject to the assessment was not initiated under the specific legislation, an extension to its validity must, in accordance with Paragraph 37(7), be requested from the Ministry.
Paragraph 32 of Law No 50/1976 Zb. on urban planning, in its version applicable to the facts in the main proceedings, provides:
Construction of a building, changes to land use and the protection of major interests in the land are possible only on the basis of an urban planning decision taking the form of a location decision.
Paragraph 8(3) and (4) of Law No 245/2003 Z.z. on integrated pollution prevention and control and amending a number of laws, as amended by Law No 532/2005 (‘Law No 245/2003’), provides:
Where there is an integrated operating permit, which at the same time requires a permit for a new building or for alterations to an existing building, the procedure shall also include an urban planning procedure, a procedure for changes prior to completion of the building and a procedure for the authorisation of improvements.
The urban planning procedure, the assessment of the environmental impact of the installation and the determination of the conditions for the prevention of serious industrial accidents shall not form part of the integrated permit.
Paragraph 11(2) of that law specifies:
The application [for the integrated permit] must be accompanied by the final opinion following from the environment impact assessment procedure, if required due to the operation, the urban planning decision, if it is a new operation or the expansion of an existing operation.
Paragraph 12 of that law, entitled ‘Commencement of the procedure’, states:
After having confirmed that the application is complete and specified the group of parties involved in the procedure and the bodies concerned, the administration shall publish the application on its internet page, with the exception of the annexes which are not available in an electronic form, and, for a minimum period of 15 days, shall publish in its official list the essential information on the application lodged, the operator and the operation.
The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling.
The administrative procedure
On 26 June 1997, Mesto Pezinok adopted General Regulation No 2/1997 on urban planning, which provided, inter alia, for the location of a landfill site in a trench used for the extraction of earth for use in brick-making, called ‘Nová jama’ (new trench).
On the basis of an assessment report for a proposed location of a landfill site presented by Pezinské tehelne as on 16 December 1998, the Ministry of the Environment carried out an environmental impact assessment in 1999.
It delivered a final opinion on 26 July 1999.
On 7 August 2002, Ekologická skládka presented to the competent service of Mesto Pezinok an application seeking to be granted an urban planning decision on the location of a landfill site on the Nová jama site.
On 27 March 2006, at the request of Pezinské tehelne as, the Ministry of the Environment extended the validity of its final opinion of 26 July 1999 until 1 February 2008.
By decision of 30 November 2006, in the version resulting from a decision of the Krajský stavebný úrad v Bratislave (regional urban planning service of Bratislava) of 7 May 2007, Mesto Pezinok authorised, at the request of Ekologická skládka, the establishment of a landfill site on the Nová jama site.
Following an application for an integrated permit lodged on 25 September 2007 by Ekologická skládka, the Slovenská inšpekcia životného prostredia, Inšpektorát životného prostredia Bratislava (Slovak environment inspection, environment inspection authority of Bratislava; ‘the inšpektorát’) initiated an integrated procedure on the basis of Law No 245/2003, which was the measure transposing Directive 96/61.
On 17 October 2007, together with the public services for environmental protection, it published that application and set out a period of 30 days for the submission of observations by the public and the State services concerned.
Since the appellants in the main proceedings had invoked the incomplete nature of the application for an integrated permit submitted by Ekologická skládka, in so far as it did not contain, as an annex provided for under Paragraph 11(2)(g) of Law No 245/2003, the urban planning decision on the location of the landfill site, the inšpektorát stayed the integrated procedure on 26 November 2007 and requested notification of that decision.
On 27 December 2007, Ekologická skládka forwarded that decision and indicated that it considered it to be commercially confidential.
On the basis of that indication, the inšpektorát did not make the document at issue available to the appellants in the main proceedings.
On 22 January 2008, the inšpektorát issued Ekologická skládka with an integrated permit for the construction of the installation ‘Pezinok – landfill site’ and for its operation.
The appellants in the main proceedings lodged an appeal against that decision before the inšpekcia, which is the environmental protection body at second instance.
That body decided to publish the urban planning decision on the location of the landfill site in the official list from 14 March to 14 April 2008.
In the context of the administrative procedure at second instance, the appellants in the main proceedings relied, inter alia, on the error in law which, they submit, consisted in the integrated procedure being initiated without the urban planning decision on the location of the landfill site being available, then, after that decision had been submitted, without publication thereof, on the alleged ground that it constituted confidential commercial information.
By decision of 18 August 2008, the inšpekcia dismissed the appeal as unfounded.
The judicial proceedings
The appellants in the main proceedings brought an action against the inšpekcia’s decision of 18 August 2008 before the Krajský súd Bratislava (Regional Court of Bratislava), an administrative court of first instance.
By judgment of 4 December 2008, that court dismissed the action.
The appellants in the main proceedings lodged an appeal against that judgment before the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky (Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic).
By order of 6 April 2009, that court suspended the operation of the integrated permit.
By judgment of 28 May 2009, the same court amended the judgment of the Krajský súd Bratislava and annulled the decision of the inšpekcia of 18 August 2008 and the decision of the inšpektorát dated 22 January 2008, in essence finding that the competent authorities had failed to observe the rules governing the participation of the public concerned in the integrated procedure and had not sufficiently assessed the environmental impact of the construction of the landfill site.
Ekologická skládka lodged a constitutional appeal before the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky (Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic) on 25 June 2009 against the order of the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky of 6 April 2009 and, on 3 September 2009, a constitutional appeal against the judgment of that latter court of 28 May 2009.
By judgment of 27 May 2010, the Ustavný súd Slovenskej republiky held that the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky had infringed Ekologická skládka’s fundamental right to legal protection, recognised in Article 46(1) of the Constitution, its fundamental right to property, recognised in Article 20(1) of the Constitution, and its right to peaceful enjoyment of its property, recognised in Article 1 of the Additional Protocol to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4 November 1950.
It found, inter alia, that the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky had not taken account of all the applicable principles governing the administrative procedure and that it had exceeded its powers by examining the lawfulness of the procedure and of the environmental impact assessment decision, even though the appellants had not disputed them and it lacked jurisdiction to rule on them.
By its judgment, the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky consequently annulled the contested order and set aside the judgment, referring the case back to the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky so that it could give a fresh ruling.
The Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky observes that several participants in the proceedings pending before it claim that it is bound by the judgment of the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky of 27 May 2010.
None the less, it notes that it still has doubts as to the compatibility of the contested decisions with European Union law.
In those circumstances, the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling.
Is it possible to fulfil the basic objective of integrated prevention as defined, in particular, in recitals 8, 9 and 23 in the preamble to and Articles 1 and 15 of Directive [96/61], and, in general, in the [European Union legal] framework on the environment, that is, pollution prevention and control involving the public in order to achieve a high level of environmental protection as a whole, by means of a procedure where, on commencement of an integrated prevention procedure, the public concerned is not guaranteed access to all relevant documents (Article 6 in conjunction with Article 15 of Directive [96/61]), especially the decision on the location of a structure (landfill site), and where, subsequently, at first instance, the missing document is submitted by the applicant on condition that it is not disclosed to other parties to the proceedings in view of the fact that it constitutes trade secrets: can it reasonably be assumed that the location decision (in particular its statement of reasons) will significantly affect the submission of suggestions, observations or the other comments?
Are the objectives of [Directive 85/337] met, especially in terms of the [European Union legal] framework on the environment, specifically the condition referred to in Article 2 that, before consent is given, certain projects will be assessed in the light of their environmental impact, if the original position of the Ministerstvo životného prostredia (Ministry of the Environment) issued in 1999 and terminating a past environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure is prolonged several years later by a simple decision without a repeat EIA procedure; in other words, can it be said that a decision under [Directive 85/337], once issued, is valid indefinitely?
Does the requirement arising generally under Directive [96/61] (in particular the preamble and Articles 1 and 15a) for Member States to engage in the prevention and control of pollution by providing the public with fair, equitable and timely administrative or judicial proceedings in conjunction with Article 10a of Directive [85/337] and Articles 6 and 9(2) and (4) of the Aarhus Convention apply to the possibility for the public to seek the imposition of an administrative or judicial measure which is preliminary in nature in accordance with national law (for example, an order for the judicial suspension of enforcement of an integrated permit) and allows for the temporary suspension, until a final decision in the case, of the construction of an installation for which a permit has been requested?
Is it possible, by means of a judicial decision meeting the requirements of Directive [96/61] or Directive [85/337] or Article 9(2) and (4) of the Aarhus Convention, in the application of the public right contained therein to fair judicial protection within the meaning of Article 191(1) and (2) [TFEU], concerning European Union policy on the environment, to interfere unlawfully with an operator’s right of property in an installation as guaranteed, for example, in Article 1 of the Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, for example by revoking an applicant’s valid integrated permit for a new installation in judicial proceedings?’
Consideration of the questions referred
The inšpekcia, Ekologická skládka and the Slovak Government challenge, on a variety of grounds, the admissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling or of some of the questions referred.
In the first place, in the view of the inšpekcia and Ekologická skládka, all of the questions referred are inadmissible because they concern situations which are entirely governed by internal rules, in particular by the acts transposing Directives 85/337 and 96/61.
Ekologická skládka infers from this that those directives have no direct effect, while the inšpekcia considers that they are sufficiently clear to render the reference for a preliminary ruling unnecessary.
The inšpekcia also argues that the questions referred ought to have been raised during the first stage of the proceedings brought before the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky.
Likewise, Ekologická skládka takes the view that those questions are superfluous in so far as the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky is now bound by the position in law taken by the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky and that none of the parties in the main proceedings requested that the Court of Justice be seised of those questions.
In the second place, Ekologická skládka claims that the separation established by national law between the integrated procedure, the urban planning procedure and the environmental impact assessment procedure renders the second and third questions irrelevant to the outcome of the main proceedings.
In the view of the inšpekcia, that separation justifies the contention that the third, fourth and fifth questions are inadmissible.
That is because it implies that a defect arising from the urban planning decision or the environmental impact assessment has no effect on the lawfulness of the integrated permit.
In the third place, Ekologická skládka and the Slovak Government take the view that the fourth question is hypothetical.
First, the interim measures ordered by the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky in its order of 6 April 2009 are, they contend, now wholly deprived of effectiveness.
Second, that question is irrelevant to the proceedings pending before the referring court since those proceedings concern the validity of the contested administrative decisions and not the delivery of new interim measures.
In the fourth and last place, Ekologická skládka claims that the fifth question is also hypothetical as it concerns the decision that the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky will be called upon to make at the conclusion of the main proceedings.
Moreover, that question is also inadmissible because it concerns the interpretation of national constitutional law.
In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court.
Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of European Union law, the Court is in principle required to give a ruling (Case C-169/07 Hartlauer [2009] ECR I-1721, paragraph 24, and Case C-470/11 Garkalns [2012] ECR, paragraph 17).
It follows that questions relating to European Union law enjoy a presumption of relevance.
The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of European Union law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (Joined Cases C-570/07 and C-571/07 Blanco Pérez and Chao Gómez [2010] ECR I-4629, paragraph 36, and Case C-509/10 Geistbeck [2012] ECR, paragraph 48).
However, the argument relating to the completeness of national law does not enable it to be established that the interpretation of the rules of European Union law cited by the referring court clearly bear no relation to the dispute in the main proceedings, particularly as it is not disputed that the applicable national provisions are in part measures transposing European Union acts.
Therefore, that argument does not suffice to reverse the presumption of relevance referred to in the previous paragraph.
It must be stated that the alleged absence of direct effect of the directives at issue does not alter that analysis because the Court has jurisdiction, under Article 267 TFEU, to give preliminary rulings concerning the interpretation of acts of the institutions of the European Union, irrespective of whether they are directly applicable (Case C-373/95 Maso and Others [1997] ECR I-4051, paragraph 28; Case C-254/08 Futura Immobiliare and Others [2009] ECR I-6995, paragraph 34; and Case C-370/12 Pringle [2012] ECR, paragraph 89).
Moreover, as regards the assumed irrelevance of the request for a preliminary ruling by reason of the clarity of the applicable rules, it must be recalled that Article 267 TFEU always allows a national court, if it considers it desirable, to refer questions of interpretation to the Court (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-165/09 to C-167/09 Stichting Natuur en Milieu and Others [2011] ECR I-4599, paragraph 52 and the case-law cited).
The other arguments put forward by the inšpekcia and Ekologická skládka to demonstrate the inadmissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling in its entirety concern the purpose of the first question and will for that reason be addressed by the Court when it examines that question.
As regards the factors arising from the separation of the various proceedings under national law, it is important to note that the referring court adopts a view of the consequences which must be drawn from that separation under national law which is very different from that supported by the inšpekcia and Ekologická skládka.
However, in the procedure laid down by Article 267 TFEU, the functions of the Court of Justice and those of the referring court are clearly distinct, and it falls exclusively to the latter to interpret national legislation (Case C-295/97 Piaggio [1999] ECR I-3735, paragraph 29, and Case C-500/06 Corporación Dermoestética [2008] ECR I-5785, paragraph 21).
Consequently, those factors are insufficient to show that the questions raised are manifestly unconnected with the facts or subject-matter of the dispute.
With regard to the admissibility of the fourth question, it is apparent from the decision making the reference that the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky adopted new interim measures designed to suspend the effect of the decisions at issue in the main proceedings.
Moreover, Ekologická skládka states in its written observations that it considered it useful to bring an action challenging those measures.
In those circumstances, it does not appear that the fourth question can be regarded as hypothetical.
Finally, so far as the admissibility of the fifth question is concerned, it is not in dispute that the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky held that the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky had infringed Ekologická skládka’s right to property by its judgment of 28 May 2009, which found that the integrated permit had been granted under circumstances incompatible with European Union law.
In so far as the referring court continues to have doubts as to the compatibility with European law of the decisions contested in the case in the main proceedings, the fifth question is not purely hypothetical.
The questions submitted by the referring court must accordingly be declared admissible.
The first question
By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 267 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that a national court may, of its own motion, refer a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling even though it rules following a referral back after the constitutional court of the Member State concerned has annulled its first decision and although a national rule obliges it to resolve the dispute by following the legal opinion of that latter court.
It also asks whether Article 267 TFEU must be interpreted as obliging that same national court to refer a case to the Court of Justice although its decisions may form the subject, before a constitutional court, of an action limited to examining whether there has been an infringement of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the national Constitution or by an international agreement.
Firstly, it must be noted that, by its first question, the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky also wishes to know whether European Union law allows it to disapply a national rule which prohibits it from raising a ground alleging infringement of that law which was not relied on by the parties to the main proceedings.
However, it is apparent from the decision making the reference that that question concerns only Directive 85/337 and that it is consequently necessary to rule on that matter only if it appears, in the light of the response given to the third question, that that directive is applicable in the dispute in the main proceedings.
As regards the other aspects of the first question referred, it is settled case-law that Article 267 TFEU gives national courts the widest discretion in referring matters to the Court if they consider that a case pending before them raises questions involving interpretation of provisions of European Union law, or consideration of their validity, which are necessary for the resolution of the case (Case C-348/89 Mecanarte [1991] ECR I-3277, paragraph 44, and Case C-173/09 Elchinov [2010] ECR I-8889, paragraph 26).
Article 267 TFEU therefore confers on national courts the power and, in certain circumstances, an obligation to make a reference to the Court once the national court forms the view, either of its own motion or at the request of the parties, that the substance of the dispute involves a question which falls within the scope of the first paragraph of that article (Case C-261/95 Palmisani [1997] ECR I-4025, paragraph 20, and Case C-104/10 Kelly [2011] ECR I-6813, paragraph 61).
That is the reason why the fact that the parties to the main proceedings did not raise a point of European Union law before the referring court does not preclude the latter from bringing the matter before the Court of Justice (Case 126/80 Salonia [1981] ECR 1563, paragraph 7, and Case C-251/11 Huet [2012] ECR, paragraph 23).
A reference for a preliminary ruling is based on a dialogue between one court and another, the initiation of which depends entirely on the national court’s assessment as to whether that reference is appropriate and necessary (Case C-210/06 Cartesio [2008] ECR I-9641, paragraph 91, and Case C-137/08 VB Pénzügyi Lízing [2010] ECR I-10847, paragraph 29).
Moreover, the existence of a national procedural rule cannot call into question the discretion of national courts to make a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling where they have doubts, as in the case in the main proceedings, as to the interpretation of European Union law (Elchinov, paragraph 25, and Case C-396/09 Interedil [2011] ECR I-9915, paragraph 35).
A rule of national law, pursuant to which legal rulings of a higher court bind another national court, cannot take away from the latter court the discretion to refer to the Court of Justice questions of interpretation of the points of European Union law concerned by such legal rulings.
That court must be free, if it considers that a higher court’s legal ruling could lead it to deliver a judgment contrary to European Union law, to refer to the Court of Justice questions which concern it (Case C-378/08 ERG and Others [2010] ECR I-1919, paragraph 32; and Elchinov, paragraph 27).
At this stage, it must be noted that the national court, having exercised the discretion conferred on it by Article 267 TFEU, is bound, for the purposes of the decision to be given in the main proceedings, by the interpretation of the provisions at issue given by the Court of Justice and must, if necessary, disregard the rulings of the higher court if it considers, in the light of that interpretation, that they are not consistent with European Union law (Elchinov, paragraph 30).
The principles set out in the previous paragraphs apply in the same way to the referring court with regard to the legal position expressed, in the present case in the main proceedings, by the constitutional court of the Member State concerned in so far as it follows from well-established case-law that rules of national law, even of a constitutional order, cannot be allowed to undermine the unity and effectiveness of European Union law (Case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft [1970] ECR 1125, paragraph 3, and Case C-409/06 Winner Wetten [2010] ECR I-8015, paragraph 61).
Moreover, the Court of Justice has already established that those principles apply to relations between a constitutional court and all other national courts (Joined Cases C-188/10 and C-189/10 Melki and Abdeli [2010] ECR I-5667, paragraphs 41 to 45).
The national rule which obliges the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky to follow the legal position of the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky cannot therefore prevent the referring court from submitting a request for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice at any point in the proceedings which it judges appropriate, and to set aside, if necessary, the assessments made by the Ústavný súd Slovenskej republiky which might prove to be contrary to European Union law.
Finally, as a supreme court, the Najvyšší súd Slovenskej republiky is even required to submit a request for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice when it finds that the substance of the dispute concerns a question to be resolved which comes within the scope of the first paragraph of Article 267 TFEU.
The possibility of bringing, before the constitutional court of the Member State concerned, an action against the decisions of a national court, limited to an examination of a potential infringement of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the national constitution or by an international agreement, cannot allow the view to be taken that that national court cannot be classified as a court against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law within the meaning of the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU.
In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article 267 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that a national court, such as the referring court, is obliged to make, of its own motion, a request for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice even though it is ruling on a referral back to it after its first decision was set aside by the constitutional court of the Member State concerned and even though a national rule obliges it to resolve the dispute by following the legal opinion of that latter court.
The second question
By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 96/61 must be interpreted as requiring that the public should have access, from the beginning of the authorisation procedure for a landfill site, to an urban planning decision on the location of that installation.
It is also uncertain whether the refusal to disclose that decision may be justified by reliance on commercial confidentiality which protects the information contained in that decision, or, failing that, rectified by access to that decision offered to the public concerned during the administrative procedure at second instance.
First of all, it must be noted that it follows from the decision making the reference that the location at issue in the main proceedings is a landfill site receiving more than 10 tonnes of waste per day or with a total capacity exceeding 25000 tonnes of waste.
Therefore, it falls within the scope of Directive 96/61, as this results from Article 1, read in conjunction with point 5.4 of Annex I, thereof.
Article 15 of that directive provides for the participation of the public concerned in the procedure for the issuing of permits for new installations and specifies that that participation is to occur under the conditions set out in Annex V to that directive.
That annex requires that the public be informed, in particular, of details of the competent authorities from which relevant information can be obtained and an indication of the date and place where that information will be made available to the public.
Those rules on public participation must be interpreted in the light of, and having regard to, the provisions of the Aarhus Convention, with which, as follows from recital 5 in the preamble to Directive 2003/35, which amended in part Directive 96/61, European Union law should be ‘properly aligned’ (Case C-115/09 Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland, Landesverband Nordrhein-Westfalen [2011] ECR I-3673, paragraph 41).
However, Article 6(6) of that convention states that the public concerned must be able to have access to all information relevant to the decision-making relating to the authorisation of activities referred to in Annex I to that convention, including in particular landfill sites receiving more than 10 tonnes of waste per day or with a total capacity exceeding 25000 tonnes of waste.
Therefore, the public concerned by the authorisation procedure under Directive 96/61 must, in principle, have access to all information relevant to that procedure.
It follows from the decision making the reference and from the file submitted to the Court of Justice that the urban planning decision on the location of the installation at issue in the main proceedings constitutes one of the measures on the basis of which the final decision whether or not to authorise that installation will be taken and that it is to include information on the environmental impact of the project, on the conditions imposed on the operator to limit that impact, on the objections raised by the parties to the urban planning decision and on the reasons for the choices made by the competent authority to issue that urban planning decision.
Moreover, the applicable national rules require that that decision be attached to the application for a permit addressed to the competent authority.
It follows that that urban planning decision must be considered to include relevant information within the meaning of Annex V to Directive 96/61 and that the public concerned must therefore, in principle, be able to have access to it during the authorisation procedure for that installation.
None the less, it follows from Article 15(4) of Directive 96/61 that the participation of the public concerned may be limited by the restrictions laid down in Article 3(2) and (3) of Directive 90/313.
At the time of the events in the main proceedings, Directive 90/313 had, however, been repealed and replaced by Directive 2003/4.
In the light of the correlation table annexed to that directive, the obligation to align European Union legislation with the Aarhus Convention and the redrafting of Article 15 of Directive 96/61 made during its subsequent codification by Directive 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (OJ 2008 L 24, p. 8), it must be held that Article 15(4) of Directive 96/61 must be construed as referring to the restrictions under Article 4(1), (2) and (4) of Directive 2003/4.
Under point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Directive 2003/4, Member States may provide for a request for information to be refused if disclosure of the information would adversely affect the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided for by national or European Union law to protect a legitimate economic interest.
However, taking account of, inter alia, the importance of the location of one or another of the activities referred to in Directive 96/61 and as results from paragraph 79 of this judgment, that cannot be the case with regard to a decision by which a public authority authorises, having regard to the applicable urban planning rules, the location of an installation which falls within the scope of that directive.
Even if it were not excluded that, exceptionally, certain elements included in the grounds for an urban planning decision may contain confidential commercial or industrial information, it is not in dispute in the present case that the protection of the confidentiality of such information was used, in breach of Article 4(4) of Directive 2003/4, to refuse the public concerned any access, even partial, to the urban planning decision concerning the location of the installation at issue in the main proceedings.
It follows that the refusal to make available to the public concerned the urban planning decision concerning the location of the installation at issue in the main proceedings during the administrative procedure at first instance was not justified by the exception set out in Article 15(4) of Directive 96/61.
It is for that reason necessary for the referring court to know whether the access to that decision given to the public concerned during the administrative procedure at second instance is sufficient to rectify the procedural flaw vitiating the administrative procedure at first instance and consequently rule out any breach of Article 15 of Directive 96/61.
In the absence of rules laid down in this field by European Union law, the detailed procedural rules designed to ensure the protection of the rights which individuals acquire under European Union law are a matter for the legal order of each Member State, provided, however, that they are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and that they do not render impossible in practice or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by the European Union legal order (principle of effectiveness) (Case C-312/93 Peterbroeck [1995] ECR I-4599, paragraph 12, and Case C-378/10 VALE Építési [2012] ECR, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).
So far as concerns the principle of equivalence, this requires that all the rules applicable to actions apply without distinction to actions based on infringement of European Union law and those based on infringement of national law (see, inter alia, Case C-591/10 Littlewoods Retail and Others [2012] ECR, paragraph 31, and Case C-249/11 Byankov [2012] ECR, paragraph 70).
It is therefore for the national court to determine whether national law allows procedural flaws of a comparable internal nature to be rectified during the administrative procedure at second instance.
As regards the principle of effectiveness, while European Union law cannot preclude the applicable national rules from allowing, in certain cases, the regularisation of operations or measures which are unlawful in the light of European Union law, such a possibility is subject to the condition that it does not offer the persons concerned the opportunity to circumvent the European Union rules or to dispense with applying them, and that it should remain the exception (Case C-215/06 Commission v Ireland [2008] ECR I-4911, paragraph 57).
In that regard, it is important to note that Article 15 of Directive 96/61 requires the Member States to ensure that the public concerned are given early and effective opportunities to participate in the procedure for issuing a permit.
That provision must be interpreted in the light of recital 23 in the preamble to that directive, according to which the public must have access, before any decision is taken, to information relating to applications for permits for new installations, and of Article 6 of the Aarhus Convention, which provides, first, for early public participation, that is to say, when all options are open and effective public participation can take place, and, second, for access to relevant information to be provided as soon as it becomes available.
It follows that the public concerned must have all of the relevant information from the stage of the administrative procedure at first instance, before a first decision has been adopted, to the extent that that information is available on the date of that stage of the procedure.
As for the question whether the principle of effectiveness precludes rectification of the procedure at second instance by making available to the public relevant documents which were not accessible during the administrative procedure at first instance, it is apparent from the information provided by the referring court that, under the applicable national legislation, the administrative body at second instance has the power to amend the administrative decision at first instance.
However, it is for the referring court to determine whether, first, in the context of the administrative procedure at second instance, all options and solutions remain possible for the purposes of Article 15(1) of Directive 96/61, interpreted in the light of Article 6(4) of the Aarhus Convention, and, second, regularisation at that stage of the procedure by making available to the public concerned relevant documents still allows that public effectively to influence the outcome of the decision-making process.
Consequently, the principle of effectiveness does not preclude the possibility of rectifying, during the administrative procedure at second instance, an unjustified refusal to make available to the public concerned the urban planning decision at issue in the main proceedings during the administrative procedure at first instance, provided that all options and solutions remain possible and that rectification at that stage of the procedure still allows that public effectively to influence the outcome of the decision-making process, this being a matter for the national court to determine.
Therefore, the answer to the second question is that Directive 96/61 must be interpreted as meaning that it requires that the public concerned have access to an urban planning decision, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, from the beginning of the authorisation procedure for the installation concerned.
It does not allow the competent national authorities to refuse the public concerned access to such a decision by relying on the protection of the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided for by national or European Union law to protect a legitimate economic interest, and does not preclude the possibility of rectifying, during the administrative procedure at second instance, an unjustified refusal to make available to the public concerned an urban planning decision, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, during the administrative procedure at first instance, provided that all options and solutions remain possible and that rectification at that stage of the procedure still allows that public effectively to influence the outcome of the decision-making process, this being a matter for the national court to determine.
The third question
By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 85/337 must be interpreted as precluding the validity of an opinion on the assessment of the environmental impact of a project from being validly extended for several years after its adoption and whether, in such a case, it requires that a new assessment of the environmental impact of that project be undertaken.
In that regard, the inšpekcia and the Slovak and Czech Governments maintain that Directive 85/337 is not applicable, ratione temporis, to the situation described by the referring court.
According to settled case-law, the principle that projects likely to have significant effects on the environment must be subject to an environmental assessment does not apply where the application for authorisation for a project was formally lodged before the expiry of the period set for transposition of Directive 85/337 (Case C-431/92 Commission v Germany [1995] ECR I-2189, paragraphs 29 and 32, and Case C-81/96 Gedeputeerde Staten van Noord-Holland [1998] ECR I-3923, paragraph 23).
That directive is primarily designed to cover large-scale projects which will most often require a long time to complete.
It would therefore not be appropriate for the relevant procedures, which are already complex at national level, to be made even more cumbersome and time-consuming by the specific requirements imposed by that directive and for situations already established to be affected by it (Gedeputeerde Staten van Noord-Holland, paragraph 24).
In the present case, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that the operator’s steps to obtain the permit to complete the landfill project at issue in the main proceedings started on 16 December 1998 with the lodging of an application for an environmental impact assessment in respect of that project.
However, it follows from Article 2 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded (OJ 2003 L 236, p. 33) that Directive 85/337 had to be implemented by the Slovak Republic with effect from the date of that Member State’s accession to the European Union, namely 1 May 2004.
Nevertheless, it must be noted that the grant by the Slovak administration of the permit to complete the landfill site at issue in the main proceedings required three consecutive procedures, each of which led to the adoption of a decision.
The operator’s applications concerning the first two procedures were made on 16 December 1998 and on 7 August 2002, that is to say, before the expiry of the period set for the transposition of Directive 85/337.
By contrast, the application for the integrated permit was submitted on 25 September 2007, which is after the expiry of that period.
Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether the submission of the first two applications may be regarded as marking the formal initiation of the authorisation procedure within the meaning of the case-law referred to in paragraph 94 of this judgment.
In that regard, it is important first of all to state that the applications submitted during the first two stages of the procedure are not to be confused with mere informal contacts which are not capable of demonstrating the formal opening of the authorisation procedure (see, to that effect, Case C-431/92 Commission v Germany, paragraph 32).
Next, it must be pointed out that the environmental impact assessment completed in 1999 was carried out in order to enable completion of the landfill project which was the subject of the integrated permit.
The subsequent steps taken in the procedure, and in particular, the issue of the construction permit, are based on that assessment.
As the Advocate General has noted in point 115 of her Opinion, the fact that, under Slovak law, environmental impact is assessed separately from the actual authorisation procedure cannot extend the scope in time of Directive 85/337.
Likewise, it is apparent from the considerations set out in paragraph 79 of this judgment that the urban planning decision on the location of the landfill site at issue in the main proceedings constitutes an indispensable stage for the operator to be authorised to carry out the landfill project at issue.
That decision, moreover, imposes a number of conditions with which the operator must comply when carrying out his project.
However, when examining a comparable procedure, the Court of Justice has taken the view that the date which should be used as a reference to determine whether the application in time of a directive imposing an environmental impact assessment was the date on which the project was formally submitted because the various phases of examination of a project are so closely connected that they represent a complex operation (Case C-209/04 Commission v Austria [2006] ECR I-2755, paragraph 58).
Finally, it is apparent from settled case-law that an authorisation within the meaning of Directive 85/337 may be formed by the combination of several distinct decisions when the national procedure which allows the developer to be authorised to start works to complete his project includes several consecutive steps (see, to that effect, Case C-201/02 Wells [2004] ECR I-723, paragraph 52, and Case C-508/03 Commission v United Kingdom [2006] ECR I-3969, paragraph 102).
It follows that, in that situation, the date on which the application for a permit for a project was formally lodged must be fixed as the day on which the developer submitted an application seeking to initiate the first stage of the procedure.
It follows from the foregoing considerations that the application for a permit for the landfill project at issue in the main proceedings was formally lodged before the date of the expiry of the period set for transposition of Directive 85/337.
Consequently, the obligations arising from that directive do not apply to that project and therefore it is not necessary to answer the third question.
The fourth question
By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles 1 and 15a of Directive 96/61, read in conjunction with Articles 6 and 9 of the Aarhus Convention, must be interpreted as meaning that members of the public concerned must be able, in the context of an action under Article 15a of that directive, to ask the court or the competent independent and impartial body established by law to order interim measures of a nature temporarily to suspend the application of a permit within the meaning of Article 4 of that directive pending the final decision.
By virtue of their procedural autonomy, the Member States have discretion in implementing Article 9 of the Aarhus Convention and Article 15a of Directive 96/61, subject to compliance with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.
It is for them, in particular, to determine, in so far as the abovementioned provisions are complied with, which court of law or which independent and impartial body established by law is to have jurisdiction in respect of the review procedure referred to in those provisions and what procedural rules are applicable (see, by analogy, Joined Cases C-128/09 to C-131/09, C-134/09 and C-135/09 Boxus and Others [2011] ECR I-9711, paragraph 52).
Moreover, it is apparent from settled-case law that a national court seised of a dispute governed by European Union law must be in a position to grant interim relief in order to ensure the full effectiveness of the judgment to be given on the existence of the rights claimed under European Union law (Case C-213/89 Factortame and Others [1990] ECR I-2433, paragraph 21, and Case C-432/05 Unibet [2007] ECR I-2271, paragraph 67).
It must be added that the right to bring an action provided for by Article 15a of Directive 96/61 must be interpreted in the light of the purpose of that directive.
The Court has already held that that purpose, as laid down in Article 1 of the directive, is to achieve integrated prevention and control of pollution by putting in place measures designed to prevent or reduce emissions of the activities listed in Annex I into the air, water and land in order to achieve a high level of protection of the environment (Case C-473/07 Association nationale pour la protection des eaux et rivières and OABA [2009] ECR I-319, paragraph 25, and Case C-585/10 Møller [2011] ECR I-13407, paragraph 29).
However, exercise of the right to bring an action provided for by Article 15a of Directive 96/61 would not make possible effective prevention of that pollution if it were impossible to prevent an installation which may have benefited from a permit awarded in infringement of that directive from continuing to function pending a definitive decision on the lawfulness of that permit.
It follows that the guarantee of effectiveness of the right to bring an action provided for in that Article 15a requires that the members of the public concerned should have the right to ask the court or competent independent and impartial body to order interim measures such as to prevent that pollution, including, where necessary, by the temporary suspension of the disputed permit.
In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the fourth question is that Article 15a of Directive 96/61 must be interpreted as meaning that members of the public concerned must be able, in the context of the action provided for by that provision, to ask the court or competent independent and impartial body established by law to order interim measures such as temporarily to suspend the application of a permit, within the meaning of Article 4 of that directive, pending the final decision.
The fifth question
By its fifth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether a decision of a national court, taken in the context of national proceedings implementing the obligations resulting from Article 15a of Directive 96/61 and from Article 9(2) and (4) of the Aarhus Convention, which annuls a permit granted in infringement of the provisions of that directive, is capable of constituting an unjustified interference with the developer’s right to property enshrined in Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
As the Advocate General has noted in points 182 to 184 of her Opinion, the conditions set by Directive 96/61 restrict use of the right to property on land affected by an installation coming within the scope of that directive.
However, the right to property is not an absolute right and must be viewed in relation to its social function.
Consequently, its exercise may be restricted, provided that those restrictions in fact correspond to objectives of general interest and do not constitute, in relation to the aim pursued, disproportionate and intolerable interference, impairing the very substance of the right guaranteed (Joined Cases C-402/05 P and C-415/05 P Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission [2008] ECR I-6351, paragraph 355, and Joined Cases C-379/08 and C-380/08 ERG and Others [2010] ECR I-2007, paragraph 80).
As regards the objectives of general interest referred to above, established case-law shows that protection of the environment is one of those objectives and is therefore capable of justifying a restriction on the use of the right to property (see Case 240/83 ADBHU [1985] ECR 531, paragraph 13; Case 302/86 Commission v Denmark [1988] ECR 4607, paragraph 8; Case C-213/96 Outokumpu [1998] ECR I-1777, paragraph 32; and ERG and Others, paragraph 81).
As regards the proportionality of the infringement of the right of property at issue, where such an infringement may be established, it is sufficient to state that Directive 96/61 operates a balance between the requirements of that right and the requirements linked to protection of the environment.
Consequently, the answer to the fifth question is that a decision of a national court, taken in the context of national proceedings implementing the obligations resulting from Article 15a of Directive 96/61 and from Article 9(2) and (4) of the Aarhus Convention, which annuls a permit granted in infringement of the provisions of that directive is not capable, in itself, of constituting an unjustified interference with the developer’s right to property enshrined in Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Costs
Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.
Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.
On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:
Article 267 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that a national court, such as the referring court, is obliged to make, of its own motion, a request for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice of the European Union even though it is ruling on a referral back to it after its first decision was set aside by the constitutional court of the Member State concerned and even though a national rule obliges it to resolve the dispute by following the legal opinion of that latter court.
Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006, must be interpreted as meaning that it requires that the public concerned have access to an urban planning decision, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, from the beginning of the authorisation procedure for the installation concerned.
It does not allow the competent national authorities to refuse the public concerned access to such a decision by relying on the protection of the confidentiality of commercial or industrial information where such confidentiality is provided for by national or European Union law to protect a legitimate economic interest, and does not preclude the possibility of rectifying, during the administrative procedure at second instance, an unjustified refusal to make available to the public concerned an urban planning decision, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, during the administrative procedure at first instance, provided that all options and solutions remain possible and that regularisation at that stage of the procedure still allows that public effectively to influence the outcome of the decision-making process, this being a matter for the national court to determine.
Article 15a of Directive 96/61, as amended by Regulation No 166/2006, must be interpreted as meaning that members of the public concerned must be able, in the context of the action provided for by that provision, to ask the court or competent independent and impartial body established by law to order interim measures such as temporarily to suspend the application of a permit, within the meaning of Article 4 of that directive, pending the final decision.
A decision of a national court, taken in the context of national proceedings implementing the obligations resulting from Article 15a of Directive 96/61, as amended by Regulation No 166/2006, and from Article 9(2) and (4) of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters, signed in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 and approved on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 2005/370/EC of 17 February 2005, which annuls a permit granted in infringement of the provisions of that directive is not capable, in itself, of constituting an unjustified interference with the developer’s right to property enshrined in Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Case C‑80/12
I – Introduction
In the United Kingdom a company can transfer losses for tax purposes to another company to which it is linked by certain corporate ties.
This reference from the First-Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) concerns primarily the question whether in terms of European Union (EU) law there is a restriction on freedom of establishment if such surrendering of losses is not possible when the company, which acts as the link between (i) the company surrendering the losses and (ii) the receiving company, is resident in another Member State.
The national court also asks whether, in terms of EU law, the situation is any different if the link between companies passes through companies in third countries.
The group relief tax scheme in the United Kingdom allows losses to be surrendered between different companies within a group of companies ( 2 ) and/or a consortium, ( 3 ) and thereby allows the optimal use of those losses for tax purposes without, however, leading to consolidation of the group or the consortium to a single economic entity for tax purposes ( 4 ).
The Court is again faced with the question whether the exclusion of certain taxpayers from the United Kingdom group relief tax scheme is compatible with the freedom of establishment.
In ICI the exclusion from the group relief scheme concerned a domestic holding company which operated mainly foreign subsidiaries, in Marks & Spencer it concerned foreign subsidiaries and in Philips Electronics UK it concerned the permanent United Kingdom establishment of a company resident in another Member State. ( 5 )
At first sight, what appears to be the novelty of the present case is the fact that the corporate ties pass through third countries and that the ultimate parent ( 6 ) is resident in a third country.
However, in the final analysis, for the purposes of assessing in the present case the conformity of the United Kingdom legislation with EU law, that question may not be decisive.
Moreover, whether there is an issue of EU law depends partly on the factual premiss regarding the existence of a usual practice in the United Kingdom whereby consideration is generally paid when losses are surrendered between companies.
This is because the present case is based on the assumption that a surrendering company will suffer if it cannot transfer the losses to claimant companies in return for consideration.
Such economic disadvantage will occur only if the surrendering company suffers a cash-flow disadvantage because of its inability to capitalise the losses immediately without having to wait for later financial years.
If, however, the surrender of losses took place without any compensation, any disadvantage stemming from the United Kingdom legislation would be felt only at group level and not at the level of the surrendering company.
II – National law, facts, procedure and the questions referred
A – United Kingdom legislation
The national provisions applied in the main proceedings are in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA).
‘Group of companies’ is defined as follows in section 413(3) ICTA: two companies are deemed to be members of a group of companies if one is the 75% subsidiary of the other or both are 75% subsidiaries of a third company.
ICTA provides for two types of group relief: group claims for group relief (which were at issue in Marks & Spencer) and consortium claims for group relief (‘consortium relief’) (which were at issue in ICI and Philips Electronics UK and are at issue in this case).
According to section 402 ICTA, relief for trading losses and other amounts eligible for relief from corporation tax may be surrendered by a company (‘the surrendering company’) and, on the making of a claim by another company (‘the claimant company’), may be allowed to the claimant company by way of a relief from corporation tax called ‘group relief’.
Subsection 3 of that provision provides that, on the making of what is called a ‘consortium claim’, group relief is also to be available in the case of a surrendering company and a claimant company, inter alia, where one of them is a member of a group of companies and the other is owned by a consortium and another company is a member of both the group and the consortium.
According to subsection 3A of section 402 ICTA, group relief is not available unless the condition laid down in subsection 3B, namely that the company is resident in the United Kingdom or is a non-resident company carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment, is satisfied in the case of both the surrendering company and the claimant company.
Section 406(1) ICTA contains three definitions.
‘Link company’ means a company which is a member of a consortium and is also a member of a group of companies.
‘Consortium company’, in relation to a link company, means a company owned by the consortium of which the link company is a member.
‘Group member’, in relation to a link company, means a company which is a member of the group of which the link company is also a member but is not itself a member of the consortium of which the link company is a member.
According to section 406(2) ICTA, ‘where the link company could make a consortium claim in respect of the loss or other amount eligible for relief of a relevant accounting period of a consortium company, a group member may make any consortium claim which could be made by the link company’, corresponding to the same fraction of the losses surrendered as if the link company were the claimant company.
The combined effect of section 402(3A) and (3B) and of section 406(2) ICTA is that the link company for the purposes of consortium relief has to be a company resident in the United Kingdom or a non-resident company carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment.
In other words, the link company as well as the surrendering and claimant companies must be liable to United Kingdom corporate tax.
B – The company group and the consortium
In the present case Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company Ltd and others are the ‘claimant companies’. ( 7 )
They are all members of the Hutchison Whampoa Group, whose ultimate parent is Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, a company incorporated and resident in Hong Kong, which indirectly owns 100% of the shares in the claimant companies. ( 8 )
Hutchison 3G UK Ltd is the ‘surrendering company’.
It was 100% owned by Hutchison 3G UK Holdings Ltd.
Hutchison 3G UK Holdings Ltd was the consortium company.
During the relevant period Hutchison 3G UK Holdings Ltd was owned by a consortium composed of Hutchison 3G UK Investments Sàrl, a Hutchison Whampoa Group company incorporated and resident in Luxembourg (50.1%), three other Hutchison Whampoa Group companies incorporated and resident in the British Virgin Islands (for a total of 14.9%), and two other companies unrelated to the Hutchison Whampoa Group (20% and 15%, respectively).
Hutchison 3G UK Investments Sàrl was the ‘link company’, acting as connector between the group and the consortium.
It was wholly owned by Hutchison Europe Telecommunications Sàrl, a company incorporated and resident in Luxembourg. ( 9 )
Both companies are indirect 100% subsidiaries of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
Further ties connecting the link company to Hutchison Whampoa Ltd pass through various intermediate holding companies incorporated in Luxembourg and outside the EU/EEA (Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands).
C – The main proceedings and the questions referred
The surrendering company carried on business as a mobile telephony operator.
It incurred considerable expense in setting up its system and thus suffered substantial losses in its first years of operation.
During the relevant period, for the purposes of section 406(1)(b) ICTA, the surrendering company was owned by the consortium company as explained above.
The claimant companies, having made trading profits during the same period, sought to use the losses of the surrendering company.
According to the order for reference, the surrendering company was, pursuant to an arrangement within the Hutchison Whampoa Group, entitled to receive 30 pence for every £1 of losses surrendered.
The claimant companies were ‘group members’ within the meaning of section 406(1)(c) ICTA since they were indirect subsidiaries of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, in which the latter held an interest of not less than 75%. ( 10 )
The claimant companies made claims for consortium relief under sections 402(3) and 406 ICTA.
Their claims were refused on the ground that the link company (which was in no way directly involved in these proceedings), was not resident in the United Kingdom, but in Luxembourg.
It could not transmit a right to make a claim for consortium relief to another group member under section 406(1) ICTA because it had no right to make such a claim itself, by virtue of the exclusion contained in section 402(3B).
Following referral of the case to the First-Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber), the latter decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling:
In circumstances where: the provisions of a Member State (such as the United Kingdom) provide for a company (a “claimant company”) to claim group relief for the losses of a company that is owned by a consortium (a “consortium company”) on the condition that a company that is a member of the same group of companies as the claimant company is also a member of the consortium (a “link company”), and the parent company of the group of companies (not itself being the claimant company, the consortium company or the link company) is not a national of the United Kingdom or any other Member State.
Do Articles 49 TFEU and 54 TFEU [formerly Articles 43 EC and 48 EC] preclude the requirement that the “link company” be either resident in the United Kingdom or carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment situated there?
If the answer to question 1 is yes, is the United Kingdom required to provide a remedy to the claimant company (for example, by allowing that company to claim relief for the losses of the consortium company) in circumstances where the “link company” has exercised its freedom of establishment but the consortium company and the claimant companies have not exercised any of the freedoms protected by European Law, the link(s) between the surrendering company and the claimant company consists of companies not all of which are established in the EU/[European Economic Area (EEA)].’
Written observations were lodged by the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company and Others, by the German, French, Netherlands and United Kingdom Governments as well as by the European Commission.
A hearing was held on 3 September 2013 in which oral submissions were made by each of those parties except for the French Government.
III – Analysis
A – Preliminary observations
The two questions asked by the referring court concern the freedom of establishment.
I will base my analysis on Articles 43 EC and 48 EC, since Articles 49 TFEU and 54 TFEU are not applicable ratione temporis to the situation in the main proceedings.
For the purposes of this analysis, I will discuss the two questions together.
In substance the referring court asks, in the first place, whether in the situation at issue in the main proceedings, Articles 43 EC and 48 EC preclude the requirement that, for the purposes of the consortium relief scheme, the link company be either resident in the United Kingdom or carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment.
In the second place, it enquires whether those articles prohibit a Member State from requiring that the lowest common parent within a group of companies to which the link company and the companies receiving the losses for tax purposes belong be resident in a Member State or an EEA State, or that the connections between the link company and the companies receiving the losses for tax purposes consist solely of such companies.
Finally it asks whether a remedy such as allowing consortium relief for the claimant companies must be available if the United Kingdom rule infringes the freedom of establishment.
It should be made clear at the outset that this case does not relate to the allocation of powers of taxation between the Member States even though, as the observations of the German and French Governments demonstrate, it is feared that the outcome of this case might jeopardise their competence to tax international groups of companies under the control of third country parent companies.
Indeed, the present case is about the transfer of losses from one United Kingdom company liable to United Kingdom corporation tax with the aim of setting them off against profits earned by another United Kingdom company also liable to United Kingdom corporation tax in that Member State.
There is thus no issue of cross-border surrendering of losses between companies resident in different Member States, which would raise the question of the allocation of powers of taxation, as was the case in National Grid Indus ( 11 ) and Philips Electronics UK. ( 12 )
The present case is only about whether the surrendering of losses from one United Kingdom company to another consortium member may, for the purposes of consortium relief, be made subject to the requirement that the link company is a United Kingdom company or has a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom.
In this context it is useful to refer to the three stages of development of the United Kingdom legislation on group relief.
Until 1 April 2000 (that is, before the period relevant to the present proceedings), a claim for group relief between two sister companies was not allowed if their parent company was not resident in the United Kingdom.
However, since 1 April 2000 (the period relevant to the present proceedings), companies belonging to the same group have been able to transfer losses between themselves irrespective of the residence of their parent.
It follows that if the Hutchison Whampoa Group had (indirectly) held at least 75% of the surrendering company during the relevant period, instead of the 65% it actually held, there would have been no obstacle to the use by the claimant companies of the losses of the surrendering company, since it would have been a group member for the purposes of section 402(1) and (2) ICTA.
In 2010, subsequent to the period to which the main proceedings relate, the United Kingdom group relief rules were amended by the Corporation Tax Act 2010, enabling a company established in the EU/EEA to serve as a link company.
However, the new rules require the link company and the claimant companies to be members of the same group without the involvement of a non-EU/EEA company.
Consequently, if the Court were to find that there is a prohibited restriction of fundamental freedoms, the United Kingdom legislation in question could not be justified by reference to the need to preserve the allocation of powers of taxation between the Member States.
Nor could cohesion of the tax system be invoked as a justification in view of the legislative developments described above which have made group relief available irrespective of the nationality of the parent or group companies other than the surrendering company and the claimant company.
In fact, the United Kingdom does not put forward any justification for the national rule as amended because, in its submission, the situation in the main proceedings falls outside the scope of EU law. ( 13 )
It should also be recalled that according to the case-law, although direct taxation falls within the competence of the Member States, that competence may not be exercised in conflict with EU law, and more particularly the fundamental freedoms guaranteed in the Treaties.
As Advocate General Kokott has observed, under EU law the Member States are, in principle, not required to provide in their corporation tax legislation for group relief for losses because the formulation of the tax system is a matter for each Member State.
However, in so far as such a right is provided, it must be provided in a manner consistent with the fundamental freedoms under EU law, especially with the freedom of establishment. ( 14 )
B – Functioning of the group relief scheme
In economic terms, group relief of the kind applicable in the United Kingdom enables the surrendering company to transfer its losses to the claimant company, which can deduct them from its taxable profits.
This entails the surrendering company losing the possibility of using those losses for tax purposes, and more particularly the option of carrying the losses forward to subsequent financial years. ( 15 )
It seems that usual practice in the United Kingdom is for this surrender to take place in return for consideration, ( 16 ) which often corresponds to the value of the corporation tax saved because of the loss, even though there is no legal requirement for consideration, except, possibly, to the extent that the fiduciary duties of the surrendering company’s management under company law give rise to such a requirement.
For example, in the present case the claimant companies have agreed to pay 30 pence per £1 for the losses surrendered.
As the United Kingdom group relief scheme is not based on consolidating the profits and losses for tax purposes at the company group level, it is clear that a surrendering company, as an independent legal person with a profit-making objective, could normally not consent to surrender without compensation the losses that it could later use to minimise its own future taxes.
By surrendering the losses against compensation that reflects the applicable corporation tax rate, the surrendering company monetises its losses earlier (and more surely), and thereby gains a cash-flow advantage.
If the existing practice in the United Kingdom were not as described above, it would be difficult to see how a surrendering company could suffer any actual harm as the result of a legal rule preventing it from surrendering its losses to another company, in other words, from transferring assets having potential economic value as a counter-claim to future tax liabilities to an outsider for a consideration not reflecting their value in the hands of the surrendering company.
It would be equally difficult to claim that a legal rule preventing a profit-seeking company from transferring its assets without due consideration would constitute a restriction of the freedom of establishment.
Hence, in the absence of this factual background the disadvantages stemming from the United Kingdom legislation would not be felt at the level of the surrendering company but only by those companies which are higher in the group and the consortium than the surrendering company and the claimant companies, that is to say, at group level as a higher tax charge of the group as a whole.
This cash-flow advantage, or the possibility of having such an advantage, is likely to increase the value of the surrendering company, and, correspondingly, of any shareholding in it.
This means that the possibility of group relief is advantageous for the owners of the surrendering company, be they direct or indirect parents, or consortium members with minority shareholdings. ( 17 )
For a claimant company such a solution is financially neutral: it pays to the surrendering company a sum corresponding to the tax it avoids because of the surrender instead of paying the same sum to the treasury.
However, since the United Kingdom legislation requires, also in the context of consortium relief, that the claimant company and the link company belong to the same group, the advantage the group gains from group relief explains the arrangements between the claimant companies and surrendering companies as at group level it leads to a lesser tax charge. ( 18 )
C – Which fundamental freedom is relevant ratione materiae?
In view of the criteria laid down in the Court’s case-law, it might appear doubtful whether the United Kingdom legislation relates to the freedom of establishment.
For the freedom of establishment to be applicable, the Court has attached importance to the degree of control exercised over a given company.
In the present case the degree of control required under national law can be anything from 5%, which hardly brings ‘control’, up to 74.99%.
However, this issue seems to be resolved by the facts of the case as I shall explain below and freedom of establishment is also the context in which the referring court has situated the questions.
Third country aspects relating to the complicated corporate structure of the Hutchison Whampoa Group raise the question as to whether the relevant United Kingdom legislation should be assessed in the light of the freedom of establishment, which is not applicable in relation to third countries, and/or in the light of the free movement of capital, which applies also in relation to such countries.
The Court stated in Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation (C‑35/11) that, as regards the question whether national legislation falls within the scope of one or other of the freedoms of movement, it is clear from well-established case-law that the purpose of the legislation concerned must be taken into consideration.
National legislation intended to apply only to those shareholdings which enable the holder to exert a definite influence on a company’s decisions and to determine its activities falls within the scope of the freedom of establishment.
On the other hand, national provisions which apply to shareholdings acquired solely with the intention of making a financial investment without any intention to influence the management and control of the undertaking must be examined exclusively in light of the free movement of capital. ( 19 )
In situations where it cannot be determined from its purpose whether the national legislation falls predominantly within the scope of Article 49 TFEU or Article 63 TFEU, the Court takes account of the facts of the case in point in order to determine whether the situation to which the dispute in the main proceedings relates falls within the scope of one or other of those provisions (my emphasis). ( 20 )
Here a distinction should be made between the two types of group relief available under United Kingdom law.
In view of their purpose the United Kingdom rules on group claims for group relief clearly relate to those shareholdings which enable the holder to exert a definite influence on a company’s decisions and to determine its activities.
They apply to companies which are at least 75% subsidiaries.
The rules therefore fall within the scope of the freedom of establishment.
As to the consortium claims for group relief the situation is less clear.
Provisions on consortium relief apply in situations where at least 75% of the capital of the consortium company is held by consortium members, each owning not less than 5% and not 75% or more. ( 21 )
This covers situations where there is one dominant owner but also situations where there are many mutually independent shareholders.
In theory there could be a consortium company with 20 shareholders each having a stake of 5%.
From this a situation could arise in which there were 20 link companies and the consortium company could surrender its losses, in fractions of 5%, to 20 different company groups.
In my opinion the United Kingdom provisions on consortium relief are not intended to apply only to those shareholdings which enable the holder to exert a definite influence on a company’s decisions.
As the claimant companies’ representative submitted at the hearing, the United Kingdom tax legislation does not require that any kind of legally defined collective control of the consortium company be exercised by the consortium members. ( 22 )
Therefore in my opinion holdings eligible for consortium relief could be regarded as direct investments and possible restrictions on them as restrictions of the free movement of capital. ( 23 )
However, the United Kingdom provisions also allow situations where the consortium company is under the control of a single company group.
This is the situation of the surrendering company in the present case: 65% of that company is indirectly held by the Hutchison Whampoa Group (50.1% through the link company and 14.9% through three British Virgin Islands group companies).
Consequently, the provisions in question are in principle capable of restricting the freedom of establishment and the situation at issue in the main proceedings should be regarded as falling within the scope of that fundamental freedom.
In view of these considerations I take the view that the facts of the case fall within the scope of Article 43 EC, which justifies assessing the United Kingdom consortium relief scheme primarily in the light of the freedom of establishment.
D – Existence of a restriction on freedom of establishment
Freedom of establishment, which Article 43 EC grants to EU nationals and which includes the right to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons and to set up and manage undertakings, under the conditions laid down for its own nationals by the law of the Member State where such establishment is effected, entails, in accordance with Article 48 EC, for companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the European Union, the right to exercise their activity through a subsidiary, a branch or agency.
As the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 43 EC expressly leaves traders free to choose the appropriate legal form in which they wish to pursue their activities in another Member State, that freedom of choice must not be limited by discriminatory tax provisions. ( 24 )
United Kingdom legislation requires that the link company be resident in the United Kingdom or be a non-resident company carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment.
This provision is clearly a restriction of freedom of establishment of the link company, which is established in Luxembourg, and its immediate parent company, which is also established in Luxembourg.
The Court found in Marks & Spencer that ‘[g]roup relief such as that at issue in the main proceedings constitutes a tax advantage for the companies concerned.
By speeding up the relief of the losses of the loss-making companies by allowing them to be set off immediately against the profits of other group companies, such relief confers a cash advantage on the group.’ ( 25 )
Does this mean that the disadvantage is felt only at group level, or by the ultimate parent, which in the present case is a third country undertaking?
In my opinion not.
As I explained above, at the factual level the United Kingdom group relief scheme sets off profits and losses within a group and/or a consortium, not by means of consolidated tax accounting or a transfer of taxable profits as a group contribution, but as arrangements whereby losses are surrendered in return for consideration, thus creating a cash-flow advantage for the surrendering company.
If the surrender of losses and, consequently, consortium relief is not allowed because of the nationality of the link company, it is in the first place the surrendering company which suffers a financial disadvantage in the form of loss of cash-flow advantage.
In the Court’s case-law such cash-flow disadvantage has been considered to be unfavourable treatment amounting to a restriction. ( 26 )
Disadvantage suffered by a company because of the residence status of the parent company was considered in Metallgesellschaft and Others sufficient to infringe the freedom of establishment. ( 27 )
This disadvantage is also felt by the owners of the surrendering company as a diminution of the value of their shareholdings irrespective of whether they represent controlling shareholdings, stable minority investments or portfolio investments.
It is of course only the first one that is relevant from the point of view of freedom of establishment.
Hence, in the present case the Luxembourg link company which indirectly holds 50.1% of the United Kingdom surrendering company is in a less favourable position than a United Kingdom resident company in a comparable situation would be as regards its capacity to act as the link between two United Kingdom companies liable to United Kingdom corporation tax.
The fact that the disadvantage is further reflected in the value of the Luxembourg link company and is therefore felt by its owners, which are partially third country companies, and finally by the third country ultimate parent controlling the complex corporate structure, does not change this.
There is therefore direct discrimination on the basis of the nationality of the link company.
The United Kingdom provisions make it more advantageous for the link company’s parent to establish its subsidiary in the United Kingdom than anywhere else.
As I have explained above, the United Kingdom Government has not put forward any grounds which could justify the restriction imposed by national legislation.
Accordingly, I am unable to address that issue here.
At this juncture it should also be ascertained whether the claimant companies are in fact entitled to invoke the freedom of establishment.
It is apparent from the ruling in Philips Electronics UK ( 28 ) that companies can, for taxation purposes, invoke the restrictions of the freedom of establishment of another company which is linked to them in so far as such restrictions affect their own taxation.
Hence the fact that neither the surrendering company nor the claimant companies have themselves exercised their freedom of establishment is irrelevant in this respect.
Therefore the claimant companies may, for their own taxation purposes, invoke the limitation of freedom of establishment imposed on the link company to the extent that the United Kingdom rules, as interpreted by the national court, are inconsistent with Articles 43 EC and 48 EC.
As an intermediate conclusion I submit that the requirement for United Kingdom residence or permanent establishment applicable to the link company in relation to a consortium claim for group relief constitutes an unjustified restriction of the freedom of establishment and is thus precluded by Articles 43 EC and 48 EC.
E – Third countries and freedom of establishment
The relation of the freedom of establishment to third countries is important in the present case since the referring court asks with its second question whether the United Kingdom is required to provide a remedy to the claimant company, for example, by allowing that company to claim relief for the losses of the consortium company, in circumstances where the link company has exercised its freedom of establishment but the consortium company and the claimant companies have not exercised any of the freedoms protected by EU law, and the link(s) between the surrendering company and the claimant company consists of companies not all of which are established in the EU/EEA.
This issue must, in my view, be analysed in the context of Question 1 because in essence it concerns the substantive content of the freedom of establishment, and not the remedies available in any procedural sense of the concept. ( 29 )
In other words, even if the Treaty precluded the requirement for the link company either to be a United Kingdom company or to have a permanent establishment there, would it still be permissible to require that the link company is an EU/EEA company or that the chain between the surrendering company and the claimant companies does not involve third country companies?
Unlike the free movement of capital, freedom of establishment does not apply in relation to third countries.
Does this mean that EU companies which are in fact controlled by third country companies or natural persons are excluded from freedom of establishment?
In other words, is the freedom of establishment of the Luxembourg link company affected by the fact that it is controlled by a third country parent?
It should be recalled here that Article 48 EC puts companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the European Union in the same position as nationals of the Member States so far as freedom of establishment is concerned.
As the Court stated in ICI ( 30 ) it is the corporate seat in the sense of Article 48 EC that serves as the connecting factor with the legal system of a particular State, like nationality in the case of natural persons.
There is nothing in the Treaties or the case-law of the Court to support the view that the freedom of establishment granted by EU law to the companies or firms referred to in Article 48 EC would be limited or affected by them being under the control of third country legal or natural persons.
The status of being an EU company is based on the location of the corporate seat and the legal order where the company is incorporated, not on the nationality of its shareholders.
If such EU companies were not covered by this freedom, many legal persons whose seat is in the European Union would be excluded from the freedom of establishment, and Member States could also otherwise, and not only by taxation, discriminate against them.
The judgment in Halliburton Services ( 31 ) demonstrated that the EU law rights of Member State companies were not affected by the fact that their parent company, Halliburton Inc., was established in the United States of America.
However, more far-reaching conclusions cannot be drawn from this judgment with regard to situations where EU companies without a common EU parent company belong to a non-EU company group.
In Halliburton Services the national court had already confirmed that, under the bilateral treaty concerning taxation between the Netherlands and the United States of America, the Netherlands subsidiary that had bought the Netherlands permanent establishment of the German subsidiary could not be discriminated against because of the fact that the parent company of the group was constituted in the United States. ( 32 )
Therefore, in the present case, the link company, which is registered in Luxembourg, and its immediate parent company, which is also registered in Luxembourg, enjoy freedom of establishment, regardless of the fact that they are ultimately controlled by the parent company established in Hong Kong.
F – Permitted restrictions
Does that mean that the United Kingdom cannot require there to be an unbroken chain within the EU/EEA between the surrendering company and the claimant companies?
The Commission submits in its observations that the United Kingdom could impose such a requirement but that it did not do so for the period in issue in the main proceedings.
To my mind that situation does not render this aspect of the referring court’s questions hypothetical or make the issue of third countries irrelevant in the sense that it should not be considered by the Court.
In fact, in a situation where a national provision discriminates against ‘foreign’ legal or natural persons and is therefore inconsistent with EU law, it is not inconceivable that a national court could remedy that situation through an interpretation whereby such discrimination of EU/EEA nationals or companies is eliminated without the benefits of integration being extended to third country legal or natural persons.
Whether this is legally possible is a matter of national law; EU law does not require that fundamental freedoms other than the free movement of capital be extended to third country subjects. ( 33 )
In Test Claimants in the Thin Cap Group Litigation ( 34 ) the Court excluded from the scope of application of freedom of establishment situations in which the parent controlling EU lending and borrowing companies was resident in a non-member country.
The Court held that the treatment of interest paid by the borrowing company as a distribution affected freedom of establishment but only as regards the third country parent company enjoying a level of control over each of the other companies allowing it to influence the funding decisions of those companies.
In such a situation Articles 43 EC and 48 EC were not applicable.
As the freedom of establishment does not extend to third countries, EU law would not prevent the United Kingdom legislation from requiring that the link company be established in the EU/EEA.
In other words, if, in the context of consortium relief, a surrendering company cannot surrender losses where the relevant link company is a third country company, the situation is outside the scope of Article 43 EC.
For example, if in the main proceedings the link company, being both a member of the consortium and of the group, were incorporated in the British Virgin Islands instead of in Luxemburg, its freedom of establishment could not be invoked to support a claim for consortium relief.
This would be the case even if the parent of the British Virgin Islands company were again an EU/EEA company.
I have proposed above an interpretation according to which, on the one hand, freedom of establishment is infringed where the possibility of surrendering losses is precluded if the link company is an EU/EEA company but where, on the other hand, there is no infringement when the link company is a third country company.
There I have approached the consortium relief scheme from the angle of the surrendering company and the disadvantage it may suffer, which, in terms of the freedom of establishment, affects its owners.
It also is necessary to analyse the problem from the angle of the claimant companies.
United Kingdom legislation requires that claimant companies belong to the same group as the link company, in other words the claimant company must be a 75% subsidiary of the link company or vice versa or both must be 75% subsidiaries of a third company.
In the present case the link company and the claimant companies are 100% subsidiaries of Hutchison International Limited, a Hong Kong company which itself is a 100% subsidiary of the ultimate parent company of the group, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
The chains from the link company and the claimant companies to their common parent pass through both EU/EEA and third country companies; they do not have a common EU/EEA parent company.
In a system like the United Kingdom consortium relief scheme, national rules regulating the link that is required between the link company and the claimant company may affect the freedom of establishment of their lowest common parent, which enjoys the financial advantage created by the opportunity of setting off the losses of one company against the taxable profit of another company, thereby reducing the joint tax liability of the (sub)group under it.
If that lowest common parent is an EU/EEA company, national rules regulating the link may create prohibited restrictions of the freedom of establishment.
If that lowest common parent is a third country undertaking, the situation, following the logic in Test Claimants in the Thin Cap Group Litigation, falls outside the scope of the freedom of establishment.
Furthermore, if the chain between the lowest common EU/EEA parent and the link company and/or the claimant companies passes through third countries, the situation will be outside the scope of Articles 43 EC and 48 EC.
Freedom of establishment does not extend a right to create subsidiaries or branches in Member States to legal persons established in third countries.
Just as the nationality of controlling shareholders is irrelevant for the existence of the freedom of establishment in the case of EU/EEA companies, so is it irrelevant for its non-existence in the case of third country companies.
G – Free movement of capital
As I have explained above, it is possible that the relevant United Kingdom rules on consortium relief could or should be regarded as affecting free movement of capital, more particularly direct investments in the capital of the link company.
To my mind this would not change the outcome of the analysis carried out above so far as intra-EU/EEA relations are concerned because the inability to surrender losses also creates a disadvantage for the shareholders of the link company irrespective of whether they have a controlling shareholding or a lesser shareholding.
If the free movement of capital is affected, this will require extension of the scope of the United Kingdom consortium relief to third country companies.
However, as the United Kingdom legislation also excluded third country link companies from the scope of consortium relief before 31 December 1993, the relevant provisions would not be caught by the prohibition of restrictions of the free movement of capital because of the stand-still clause in Article 57(1) EC (now Article 64 (1) TFEU). ( 35 )
H – Proposed answers
I therefore propose that the reply to the first question should be that in circumstances such as those of the case before the referring court, Articles 43 EC and 48 EC preclude a requirement that, for the purposes of a consortium relief scheme, the link company be either resident in the Member State concerned or carrying on a trade in that Member State through a permanent establishment situated there.
However, those articles do not prohibit a Member State from requiring that the lowest common parent within the group of companies to which the link company and the companies receiving the losses for tax purposes belong be an EU/EEA company and that connections between the link company and the companies receiving the losses for tax purposes consist solely of EU/EEA companies.
As to the second question, it is sufficient that it be answered in a similar manner to the fourth question in Philips Electronics UK.
IV – Conclusion
In the light of the foregoing considerations, I propose that the Court should answer the questions raised by the First-Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) as follows: in circumstances such as those of the case before the referring court, Articles 43 EC and 48 EC (now Articles 49 TFEU and 54 TFEU) preclude a requirement that, for the purposes of a consortium relief scheme, the link company be either resident in the Member State concerned or carrying on a trade in that Member State through a permanent establishment situated there.
However, those articles do not prevent national legislation from requiring that the lowest common parent within the group of companies to which the link company and the companies receiving the losses for tax purposes belong be resident in one of the Member States or in a country belonging to the European Economic Area, and that the connections between the link company and the companies receiving the losses for tax purposes consist solely of such companies.
The national court must disapply any provision of the national legislation to the extent that it is contrary to Articles 43 EC and 48 EC.
In the present context a group of companies refers to a set of parent and subsidiary companies functioning as an economic entity having a common source of control.
In general terms, a consortium can be characterised as an association of two or more companies having the objective of participating in a common activity or pooling their resources in order to achieve a common goal.
However, under United Kingdom tax law the existence of a consortium depends on a certain defined ownership threshold being met, without any requirement for a common goal.
See Opinion of Advocate General Poiares Maduro in Case C-446/03 Marks & Spencer [2005] ECR I-10837, point 17.
In the present case a distinction needs to be made between the concepts of ‘lowest common parent (company)’ and ‘ultimate parent (company)’.
The former can be characterised as follows: Company C is the lowest common parent company in relation to companies A and B if A and B are its direct or indirect subsidiaries and Company C does not have a subsidiary D which would be a parent company of both A and B.
The ultimate parent company of a company group is a company which is the direct or indirect parent of all the group companies but not itself a subsidiary of any other company.
The claimant companies are: Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company Ltd, Savers Health and Beauty Ltd, Walton Container Terminal Ltd, WPCS (UK) Finance Ltd, AS Watson Card Services (UK) Ltd, Hutchison Whampoa (Europe) Ltd, Kruidvat UK Ltd and Superdrug Stores plc.
Relevant entities between Hutchison Whampoa Ltd and the claimant companies were various intermediate holding companies incorporated outside the EU/EEA (Hong Kong or the British Virgin Islands) and in the EU (the United Kingdom or the Netherlands).
A member of the Hutchison Whampoa group subsequently (23 June 2005) acquired the latter two companies, so that Hutchison 3G UK Holdings Ltd itself became a member of the group as defined by section 413(3)(a) ICTA.
Pursuant to section 413(3) ICTA.
Case C-371/10 [2011] ECR I-12273, paragraph 45.
The Netherlands Government, in contrast, takes the view that there is a restriction on the freedom of establishment which is justified.
The nature of a cash-flow disadvantage felt at group level as a restriction of the freedom of establishment was emphasised by Advocate General Sharpston in her Opinion in Lidl Belgium, points 29 and 30.
This advantage at group level was recognised by the Court in Marks & Spencer, paragraph 32 (for citation see below).
See paragraph 6 of the judgment.
Directive 2004/83
According to the recital 3 in the preamble to Directive 2004/83, the Geneva Convention provides the cornerstone of the international legal regime for the protection of refugees.
Recital 10 of that directive states: this Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by [the Charter].
In particular this Directive seeks to ensure full respect for human dignity and the right to asylum of applicants for asylum and their accompanying family members.
Recital 16 of the directive states that minimum standards for the definition and content of refugee status should be laid down to guide the competent national bodies of Member States in the application of the Geneva Convention.
According to recital 17 in the preamble to Directive 2004/83, it is necessary to introduce common criteria for recognising applicants for asylum as refugees within the meaning of Article 1 of the Geneva Convention.
According to Article 2, for the purposes of that directive “refugee” means a third country national who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group, is outside the country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country.
Article 4 of Directive 2004/83, under Chapter II thereof entitled ‘Assessment of applications for international protection’, defines the conditions for the assessment of the facts and circumstances and provides: member States may consider it the duty of the applicant to submit as soon as possible all elements needed to substantiate the application for international protection.
In cooperation with the applicant it is the duty of the Member State to assess the relevant elements of the application.
The elements referred to in paragraph 1 consist of the applicant’s statements and all documentation at the applicant’s disposal regarding the applicant’s age, background, including that of relevant relatives, identity, nationality(ies), country(ies) and place(s) of previous residence, previous asylum applications, travel routes, identity and travel documents and the reasons for applying for international protection.
The assessment of an application for international protection is to be carried out on an individual basis and includes taking into account: all relevant facts as they relate to the country of origin at the time of taking a decision on the application; including laws and regulations of the country of origin and the manner in which they are applied; the relevant statements and documentation presented by the applicant including information on whether the applicant has been or may be subject to persecution or serious harm; the individual position and personal circumstances of the applicant, including factors such as background, gender and age, so as to assess whether, on the basis of the applicant’s personal circumstances, the acts to which the applicant has been or could be exposed would amount to persecution or serious harm; whether the applicant’s activities since leaving the country of origin were engaged in for the sole or main purpose of creating the necessary conditions for applying for international protection, so as to assess whether these activities will expose the applicant to persecution or serious harm if returned to that country; whether the applicant could reasonably be expected to avail himself of the protection of another country where he could assert citizenship.
Where Member States apply the principle according to which it is the duty of the applicant to substantiate the application for international protection and where aspects of the applicant’s statements are not supported by documentary or other evidence, those aspects shall not need confirmation, when the following conditions are met: the applicant has made a genuine effort to substantiate his application; all relevant elements, at the applicant’s disposal, have been submitted, and a satisfactory explanation regarding any lack of other relevant elements has been given; the applicant’s statements are found to be coherent and plausible and do not run counter to available specific and general information relevant to the applicant’s case; the applicant has applied for international protection at the earliest possible time, unless the applicant can demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and the general credibility of the applicant has been established.
Article 10 of Directive 2004/83, entitled ‘Reasons for persecution’, provides: Member States shall take the following elements into account when assessing the reasons for persecution: a group shall be considered to form a particular social group where in particular: members of that group share an innate characteristic, or a common background that cannot be changed, or share a characteristic or belief that is so fundamental to identity or conscience that a person should not be forced to renounce it, and that group has a distinct identity in the relevant country, because it is perceived as being different by the surrounding society.
Depending on the circumstances in the country of origin, a particular social group might include a group based on a common characteristic of sexual orientation.
Sexual orientation cannot be understood to include acts considered to be criminal in accordance with national law of the Member States.
Directive 2005/85/EC
Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (OJ 2005 L 326, p. 13, and corrigendum OJ 2006 L 236, p. 36) states in recital 8 in its preamble that the directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter.
Article 13 of Directive 2005/85, which specifies the requirements for a personal interview, provides at paragraph 3: Member States shall take appropriate steps to ensure that personal interviews are conducted under conditions which allow applicants to present the grounds for their applications in a comprehensive manner.
To that end, Member States shall: ensure that the person who conducts the interview is sufficiently competent to take account of the personal or general circumstances surrounding the application, including the applicant’s cultural origin or vulnerability, insofar as it is possible to do so.
Netherlands law
The relevant national legislation is found in Article 31 of the Law on Foreign Nationals 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000), in Article 3.111 of the Decree on Foreign Nationals 2000 (Vreemdelingenbesluit 2000) and in Article 3.35 of the Regulation on Foreign Nationals 2000 (Voorschrift Vreemdelingen 2000).
Those provisions have been clarified by paragraphs C2/2.1, C2/2.1.1, and C14/2.1 to C14/2.4 of the Foreign Nationals Circular 2000 (Vreemdelingencirculaire 2000).
According to Article 31(1) of the Law on Foreign Nationals 2000, read in conjunction with Article 3.111(1) of the Decree on Foreign Nationals 2000, it is for the applicant for asylum concerned to establish the plausibility of the grounds on which the grant of a temporary residence permit (asylum) is sought, the applicant being required to provide, on his own initiative, all relevant information in order to enable the authority to make a decision on the application.
The Staatssecretaris determines whether the grant of that authorisation is well founded in law.
Under paragraph 1 of Article 3.111 of the Decree on Foreign Nationals 2000, when an applicant for asylum requests the grant of a residence permit referred to in Article 28 of the Law on Foreign Nationals 2000, that applicant is to provide all the information, including the relevant documents, on the basis of which the Staatssecretaris can determine, in cooperation with the applicant for asylum concerned, whether there is a legal basis for the permit to be granted.
In accordance with paragraph C14/2.1 of the Foreign Nationals Circular 2000, the assessment of the credibility of the statements made by an applicant for asylum is to concern the facts and the circumstances that he sets out.
The factual circumstances are the facts relating to the person of the applicant for asylum concerned, inter alia, his sexual orientation.
Under paragraph C14/2.2 of that circular, an applicant for asylum is required to tell the truth and to cooperate fully in the determination, which is to be as complete as possible, of all the facts.
The applicant must, as soon as possible, inform the Immigration and Naturalisation Service of all the events and factual circumstances that are important for the consideration of his application.
In accordance with paragraph C14/2.3 of the circular, it is not excluded that the lack of credibility of part of the statement made by the applicant for asylum may also adversely affect the credibility of all other parts of the applicant’s statement.
According to paragraph C14/2.4 of that circular, it suffices in principle that an applicant for asylum has made his statements plausible.
For that purpose, he is expected to produce documents in support of his application.
However, in order to assess the credibility of the statements that the applicant for asylum made in support of his application, it is not a matter of deciding whether, and if so to what extent, those statements can be proved.
In many cases applicants for asylum have demonstrated that they are not in a position to prove their statements and that it would not be reasonable to require them to adduce convincing evidence in support of their account.
The Staatssecretaris may consider the statements made under Article 3.35, paragraph 3, of the Regulation on Foreign Nationals 2000 to be credible and, therefore, not to require them to be confirmed, if it was possible for the general credibility of the applicant for asylum to be established.
The disputes in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling A, B and C, third country nationals, each lodged an application for a temporary residence permit (asylum) in the Netherlands.
In support of their applications, they stated that they feared persecution in their respective countries of origin on account, in particular, of their homosexuality.
The first application for asylum lodged by A was rejected by the Staatssecretaris as not being credible.
A did not challenge that first refusal and lodged a second application for asylum, stating that he was prepared to take part in a ‘test’ that would prove his homosexuality or to perform a homosexual act to demonstrate the truth of his declared sexual orientation.
By decision of 12 July 2011, the Staatssecretaris rejected A’s second application on the ground that the credibility of his declared sexual orientation had still not been established.
The Staatssecretaris considered that it was not appropriate to rely only on the declared sexual orientation of the applicant for asylum without making any assessment of the credibility of that orientation.
On 1 August 2012, the Staatssecretaris rejected B’s application on the ground that the statements concerning his homosexuality were vague, perfunctory and implausible.
In addition, according to the Staatssecretaris, inasmuch as B is from a country where homosexuality is not accepted, he ought to have been able to give more details about his emotions and his internal awareness of his sexual orientation.
C lodged a first application for asylum on grounds other than persecution based on his homosexuality, which was rejected by the Staatssecretaris.
C did not challenge that first decision and lodged a second application for asylum based, on that occasion, on the fear of persecution in his country of origin on account of his homosexuality.
In the second application, C submitted that he had not been able to indicate his homosexual feelings until after leaving his country of origin.
In support of his application, C also gave the authorities responsible for carrying out the assessment of the application a video recording of intimate acts with a person of the same sex.
By decision of 8 October 2012, the Staatssecretaris rejected C’s application for asylum on the ground that his statements concerning his homosexuality were not credible.
The Staatssecretaris considered that C ought to have mentioned his declared sexual orientation in the first application for asylum, that he had not clearly explained how he became aware of his homosexuality and had not been able to reply to questions about Netherlands organisations for the protection of rights of homosexuals.
Following the rejection of their applications for temporary residence permits (asylum), A, B and C lodged appeals against those decisions dismissing their applications before the Rechtbank’s-Gravenhage.
By judgments of 9 September 2011 and 30 October 2012, the Rechtbank’s-Gravenhage dismissed, respectively, A and C’s appeals as unfounded.
That court held, first, that A and C ought, in their respective appeals, to have challenged the first decisions by the Staatssecretaris dismissing their applications, and, second, that they had not demonstrated, in the second asylum procedure, that their statements concerning their declared sexual orientation were credible.
By judgment of 23 August 2012, the appeal brought by B against the decision of the Staatssecretaris rejecting his application was also dismissed.
The Rechtbank’s-Gravenhage held that the Staatssecretaris could reasonably have concluded that B’s statements concerning his homosexuality were not credible.
A, B and C appealed against those judgments before the Raad van State.
In those appeal procedures, A, B and C submit in particular that, because it is impossible to determine objectively the sexual orientation of applicants for asylum, the authorities carrying out an assessment of an application for asylum should base their decisions solely on the assertions made by those applicants as regards their declared sexual orientation.
According to the applicants in the main proceedings, in the course of assessing the credibility of the statements made by an applicant for asylum, those authorities ask questions in respect of the declared sexual orientation which breach, in particular, the applicant’s right to human dignity and his right to respect for private life and which, furthermore, take account neither of the shame that the applicant could feel during the hearings nor of the cultural reservations that would prevent him from speaking freely of that orientation.
In addition, the fact that the Staatssecretaris found that the accounts given by the applicants for asylum were not credible should not lead to the same conclusion as regards the credibility of the sexual orientation itself.
The Staatssecretaris observes that it is not clear either from Directive 2004/83 or from the Charter that the determination must be made on the basis solely of the declarations by the applicants for asylum as to their declared sexual orientation.
According to the Staatssecretaris, it was, however, necessary to verify, not whether the applicants for asylum actually had the sexual orientation that they claimed to have, but rather whether they had made a plausible case that they belonged to a social group within the meaning of Article 10(1)(d) of Directive 2004/83, or whether the ‘actors of persecution’ regarded them as doing so for the purposes of Article 10(2) of that directive.
Furthermore, according to the Staatssecretaris, applicants for asylum can only rarely provide evidence of their homosexuality otherwise than by their own declarations, with the result that when those declarations are considered to be coherent and plausible and it has been possible to establish the overall credibility of the applicant for asylum, those applicants must be given the benefit of the doubt.
According to the Staatssecretaris, the assessment that he must carry out as to the credibility of the sexual orientation of applicants for asylum does not differ from that carried out in relation to other grounds of persecution.
That authority does, however, take account of the specific problems involved in testifying about sexual orientation.
In particular, staff interviewing applicants for asylum are advised not to ask explicit questions about the way in which applicants for asylum live their sexual orientation.
In addition, no weight is attached to images of sexual acts produced by applicants for asylum by way of evidence, given that they establish only the practice of the sexual acts themselves and not the reality of the declared sexual orientation.
The Raad van State observes that neither Article 4 of Directive 2004/83 nor the provisions of the Charter relied on require the Staatssecretaris to find that the declared sexual orientation of an applicant for asylum is established on the basis solely of his declarations.
Furthermore, according to that court, the verification of the sexual orientation of applicants for asylum is no different from the verification of other grounds for persecution.
Nevertheless, the Raad van State is uncertain whether there are limits imposed by Article 4 of Directive 2004/83 and Articles 3 and 7 of the Charter on the method of verification of the sexual orientation of applicants for asylum.
The referring court considers that the mere fact of putting questions to the applicant for asylum may, to a certain extent, infringe the rights guaranteed by the abovementioned provisions of the Charter.
According to that court, whatever method is adopted in the Member State concerned to verify the declared sexual orientation, the risk of infringing the fundamental rights of the applicants for asylum, such as those guaranteed by Articles 3 and 7 of the Charter, cannot be excluded.
In those circumstances, the Raad van State decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice, which is framed in the same terms in each of Cases C‑148/13 to C‑150/13: what limits do Article 4 of [Directive 2004/83] and [the Charter], in particular Articles 3 and 7 thereof, impose on the method of assessing the credibility of a declared sexual orientation, and are those limits different from the limits which apply to assessment of the credibility of the other grounds of persecution and, if so, in what respect?
By decision of the Court of 19 April 2013, cases C‑148/13 to C‑150/13 were joined for the purposes of the written and oral procedure and of the judgment.
Consideration of the question referred for a preliminary ruling
Preliminary observations
It is apparent from recitals 3, 16 and 17 in the preamble to Directive 2004/83 that the Geneva Convention constitutes the cornerstone of the international legal regime for the protection of refugees and that the provisions of the directive for determining who qualifies for refugee status and the content thereof were adopted to guide the competent authorities of the Member States in the application of that convention on the basis of common concepts and criteria (judgment in N., C‑604/12, EU:C:2014:302, paragraph 27).
Directive 2004/83 must, therefore, be interpreted in the light of its general scheme and purpose, and in a manner consistent with the Geneva Convention and the other relevant treaties referred to in Article 78(1) TFEU.
As is apparent from recital 10 in the preamble thereto, the directive must also be interpreted in a manner consistent with the rights recognised by the Charter (judgment in X and Others, C‑199/12 to C‑201/12, EU:C:2013:720, paragraph 40).
Furthermore, it should be recalled that Directive 2004/83 does not contain any procedural rules applicable to the examination of an application for international protection, nor, therefore, does it lay down the procedural guarantees that must be afforded to an applicant for asylum.
It is Directive 2005/85 that establishes minimum standards applicable to procedures for examining applications and specifies the rights of applicants for asylum that must be taken into account in the examination of the cases in the main proceedings.
Consideration of the question
By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 4 of Directive 2004/83, read in the light of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that it imposes on the competent national authorities, acting under the supervision of the courts, certain limits when they assess the facts and circumstances concerning the declared sexual orientation of an applicant for asylum, whose application is based on a fear of persecution on grounds of that sexual orientation.
In that regard, it should be noted at the outset that, contrary to the submissions made by the applicants in the main proceedings, according to which the competent authorities examining an application for asylum based on a fear of persecution on grounds of the sexual orientation of the applicant for asylum must hold the declared sexual orientation to be an established fact on the basis solely of the declarations of the applicant, those declarations constitute, having regard to the particular context in which the applications for asylum are made, merely the starting point in the process of assessment of the facts and circumstances envisaged under Article 4 of Directive 2004/83.
It is clear from the very wording of Article 4(1) of the directive that, in the context of that assessment, the Member States may consider it to be the applicant’s duty to submit as soon as possible all elements needed to substantiate the application for international protection, the Member State assessing, in cooperation with the applicant, the relevant elements of the application.
Furthermore, it follows from Article 4(5) of Directive 2004/83 that when the conditions listed under (a) to (e) of that provision are not met, statements made by applicants for asylum with respect to their declared sexual orientation may require confirmation.
It follows that, although it is for the applicant for asylum to identify his sexual orientation, which is an aspect of his personal identity, applications for the grant of refugee status on the basis of a fear of persecution on grounds of that sexual orientation may, in the same way as applications based on other grounds for persecution, be subject to an assessment process, provided for in Article 4 of that directive.
However, the methods used by the competent authorities to assess the statements and documentary or other evidence submitted in support of those applications must be consistent with the provisions of Directive 2004/83 and 2005/85 and, as is clear from recitals 10 and 8 in the preambles to those directives respectively, with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter, such as the right to respect for human dignity, enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter, and the right to respect for private and family life guaranteed by Article 7 thereof.
Even though Article 4 of Directive 2004/83 is applicable to all applications for international protection, whatever the ground for persecution relied on in support of those applications, it remains the case that it is for the competent authorities to modify their methods of assessing statements and documentary or other evidence having regard to the specific features of each category of application for asylum, in observance of the rights guaranteed by the Charter.
As regards the assessment of the facts and circumstances under Article 4 of Directive 2004/83, that assessment takes place, as was held at paragraph 64 of the judgment in M. (C‑277/11, EU:C:2012:744), in two separate stages.
The first stage concerns the establishment of factual circumstances which may constitute evidence that supports the application, while the second stage relates to the legal appraisal of that evidence, which entails deciding whether, in the light of the specific facts of a given case, the substantive conditions laid down by Articles 9 and 10 or Article 15 of Directive 2004/83 for the grant of international protection are satisfied.
During the first stage, to which the questions of the referring court in each of the cases in the main proceedings relates, while the Member State may consider that it is generally for the applicant to submit all elements needed to substantiate his application, the applicant being, besides, best placed to provide evidence to establish his own sexual orientation, the fact remains that it is the duty of the Member State to cooperate with the applicant at the stage of assessing the relevant elements of that application, in accordance with Article 4(1) of the directive (see, to that effect, judgment in M., EU:C:2012:744, paragraph 65).
It should be noted in that regard that, in accordance with Article 4(3)(c) of Directive 2004/83, that assessment must be made on an individual basis and must take account of the individual situation and personal circumstances of the applicant, including factors such as background, gender and age, in order for it to be determined whether, on the basis of the applicant’s personal circumstances, the acts to which the applicant has been or could be exposed would amount to persecution or serious harm.
Furthermore, as is recalled at paragraph 51 of this judgment, in verifications carried out by the competent authorities, pursuant to Article 4 of the directive, when certain aspects of the statements of the applicant for asylum are not substantiated by documentary or other evidence, those aspects do not require confirmation provided that the cumulative conditions laid down in Article 4(5)(a) to (e) of the directive are met.
As regards the methods of assessing the statements and documentary or other evidence at issue in each of the cases in the main proceedings, it is appropriate, in order to provide an answer useful to the referring court, to restrict the present analysis to the compatibility with Directives 2004/83 and 2005/85 and the Charter of, first, the verifications carried out by the competent authorities based on, in particular, stereotypes as regards homosexuals or detailed questioning as to the sexual practices of an applicant for asylum and the option, for those authorities, to allow the applicant to submit to ‘tests’ with a view to establishing his homosexuality and/or of allowing him to produce, of his own free will, films of his intimate acts and, second, the option for the competent authorities of finding a lack of credibility on the basis of the sole fact that the applicant did not rely on his declared sexual orientation on the first occasion he was given to set out the grounds for persecution.
As regards, in the first place, assessments based on questioning as to the knowledge on the part of the applicant for asylum concerned of organisations for the protection of the rights of homosexuals and the details of those organisations, such questioning suggests, according to the applicant in the main proceedings in case C‑150/13, that the authorities base their assessments on stereotyped notions as to the behaviour of homosexuals and not on the basis of the specific situation of each applicant for asylum.
In that respect, it should be recalled that Article 4(3)(c) of Directive 2004/83 requires the competent authorities to carry out an assessment that takes account of the individual position and personal circumstances of the applicant and that Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85 requires those authorities to conduct the interview in a manner that takes account of the personal and general circumstances surrounding the application.
While questions based on stereotyped notions may be a useful element at the disposal of competent authorities for the purposes of the assessment, the assessment of applications for the grant of refugee status on the basis solely of stereotyped notions associated with homosexuals does not, nevertheless, satisfy the requirements of the provisions referred to in the previous paragraph, in that it does not allow those authorities to take account of the individual situation and personal circumstances of the applicant for asylum concerned.
Therefore, the inability of the applicant for asylum to answer such questions cannot, in itself, constitute sufficient grounds for concluding that the applicant lacks credibility, inasmuch as such an approach would be contrary to the requirements of Article 4(3)(c) of Directive 2004/83 and of Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85.
In the second place, while the national authorities are entitled to carry out, where appropriate, interviews in order to determine the facts and circumstances as regards the declared sexual orientation of an applicant for asylum, questions concerning details of the sexual practices of that applicant are contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter and, in particular, to the right to respect for private and family life as affirmed in Article 7 thereof.
In relation, in the third place, to the option for the national authorities of allowing, as certain applicants in the main proceedings proposed, homosexual acts to be performed, the submission of the applicants to possible ‘tests’ in order to demonstrate their homosexuality or even the production by those applicants of evidence such as films of their intimate acts, it must be pointed out that, besides the fact that such evidence does not necessarily have probative value, such evidence would of its nature infringe human dignity, the respect of which is guaranteed by Article 1 of the Charter.
Furthermore, the effect of authorising or accepting such types of evidence would be to incite other applicants to offer the same and would lead, de facto, to requiring applicants to provide such evidence.
In the fourth place, as regards the option for the competent authorities finding a lack of credibility when, in particular, the applicant did not rely on his declared sexual orientation on the first occasion he was given to set out the grounds for persecution, it must be held as follows.
It is clear from Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/83 that Member States may consider it the duty of the applicant to submit ‘as soon as possible’ all elements needed to substantiate the application for international protection.
However, having regard to the sensitive nature of questions relating to a person’s personal identity and, in particular, his sexuality, it cannot be concluded that the declared sexuality lacks credibility simply because, due to his reticence in revealing intimate aspects of his life, that person did not declare his homosexuality at the outset.
Moreover, it must be observed that the obligation laid down by Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/83 to submit all elements needed to substantiate the application for international protection ‘as soon as possible’ is tempered by the requirement imposed on the competent authorities, under Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85 and Article 4(3) of Directive 2004/83 to conduct the interview taking account of the personal or general circumstances surrounding the application, in particular, the vulnerability of the applicant, and to carry out an individual assessment of the application, taking account of the individual position and personal circumstances of each applicant.
Thus, to hold that an applicant for asylum is not credible, merely because he did not reveal his sexual orientation on the first occasion that he was given to set out the grounds of persecution, would be to fail to have regard to the requirement referred to in the previous paragraph.
Having regard to all the foregoing, the answer to the question referred in each of the cases C‑148/13 to C‑150/13 is: article 4(3)(c) of Directive 2004/83 and Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85 must be interpreted as precluding, in the context of the assessment by the competent national authorities, acting under the supervision of the courts, of the facts and circumstances concerning the declared sexual orientation of an applicant for asylum, whose application is based on a fear of persecution on grounds of that sexual orientation, the statements of that applicant and the documentary and other evidence submitted in support of his application being subject to an assessment by those authorities founded on questions based only on stereotyped notions concerning homosexuals.
Article 4 of Directive 2004/83, read in the light of Article 7 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding, in the context of that assessment, the competent national authorities from carrying out detailed questioning as to the sexual practices of an applicant for asylum.
Article 4 of Directive 2004/83, read in the light of Article 1 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding, in the context of that assessment, the acceptance by those authorities of evidence such as the performance by the applicant for asylum concerned of homosexual acts, his submission to ‘tests’ with a view to establishing his homosexuality or, yet, the production by him of films of such acts.
Article 4(3) of Directive 2004/83 and Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85 must be interpreted as precluding, in the context of that assessment, the competent national authorities from finding that the statements of the applicant for asylum lack credibility merely because the applicant did not rely on his declared sexual orientation on the first occasion he was given to set out the ground for persecution.
Costs
Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.
Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.
On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: article 4(3)(c) of Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted and Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005, on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status, must be interpreted as precluding, in the context of the assessment by the competent national authorities, acting under the supervision of the courts, of the facts and circumstances concerning the declared sexual orientation of an applicant for asylum, whose application is based on a fear of persecution on grounds of that sexual orientation, the statements of that applicant and the documentary and other evidence submitted in support of his application being subject to an assessment by those authorities, founded on questions based only on stereotyped notions concerning homosexuals.
Article 4 of Directive 2004/83, read in the light of Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as precluding, in the context of that assessment, the competent national authorities from carrying out detailed questioning as to the sexual practices of an applicant for asylum.
Article 4 of Directive 2004/83, read in the light of Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as precluding, in the context of that assessment, the acceptance by those authorities of evidence such as the performance by the applicant for asylum concerned of homosexual acts, his submission to ‘tests’ with a view to establishing his homosexuality or, yet, the production by him of films of such acts.
Article 4(3) of Directive 2004/83 and Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85 must be interpreted as precluding, in the context of that assessment, the competent national authorities from finding that the statements of the applicant for asylum lack credibility merely because the applicant did not rely on his declared sexual orientation on the first occasion he was given to set out the ground for persecution.
