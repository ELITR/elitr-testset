Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s remarks and answers to media questions at a joint news conference with Foreign Minister of Iceland Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson, Moscow, November 26, 2019
Ladies and gentlemen, We held useful and meaningful talks.
Ties between Russia and Iceland have a long history.
In October 2018, we celebrated the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
However, informal ties between our countries go much deeper in history.
This year we met with Mr Thordarson on the sidelines of the Arctic Council Ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi, Finland, when our conversation focused on Arctic issues.
Today we discussed this subject again, and we also held an in-depth discussion on a number of other current issues, primarily those related to our bilateral cooperation.
We expressed a shared commitment to its progressive development in the interests of our nations and stability in the Euro-Arctic region.
We welcomed the relaunch of our political dialogue, including at the top level.

As you know, President Vladimir Putin met with President of Iceland Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson on the sidelines of the International Arctic Forum The Arctic: Territory of Dialogue in April.

Ties between our parliaments are being revitalised.
In October 2019, Speaker of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of Russia Vyacheslav Volodin met with Althing Speaker Steingrimur Johann Sigfusson during the European Conference of Presidents of Parliament. Mr Steingrimur Sigfusson was invited to visit Russia in 2020.

We hope he will accept this invitation.
Despite the sanctions pressure, we managed to reverse the negative trend in trade last year, when bilateral trade increased by over 20 percent.
Even though our trade is only estimated at $50 million so far.
However, we have agreed to keep this positive trend up and to make it sustainable.
The mechanism of regular Russian-Icelandic consultations on trade and economic cooperation has a special part to play in this, the next meeting is scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2020
We noted the Icelandic businesses’ growing interest in the Russian market.
This led to the establishment of the Icelandic-Russian Chamber of Commerce, which includes over 30 Icelandic companies, last month.


We noted with satisfaction our expanded interregional ties.
The Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District, the Kamchatka Territory, Chukotka, and the Murmansk Region are interested in interacting with their Icelandic partners.
This is more than just a show of interest.
Important projects involving innovative technology, telecommunications and geothermal energy are already being implemented in a number of Russian regions.
In particular, geothermal energy is used as generating capacity for the energy bridge project connecting Kamchatka with the Kuril Islands and, in the future, Japan.
Icelandic companies are involved in implementing this.
I will also note that Icelandic companies are involved in upgrading the Russian fishing fleet. They are involved in designing modern ships and supplying equipment.

Last month’s events are notable as well.
The Skolkovo Foundation signed an agreement on cooperation with the Icelandic Innovation Centre.
Last year, Russian S7 Airlines initiated regular service to Iceland during the summer season.
Since the experience was positive, it began selling tickets for next season.
Largely because of that, the tourist volume from Russia to Iceland was up by almost 20 percent last year, and our Icelandic colleagues are interested in consolidating this trend.
We talked about ways to strengthen our legal framework.
A number of documents are in the works.
We agreed to expedite the procedures needed for them to enter into force and the signing of those that have not yet been agreed on.
Our countries share memories of the joint struggle against Nazism.
Russia gratefully remembers Iceland's contribution to forming and supporting Arctic convoys.
We mentioned today that President Putin invited his Icelandic colleague, President Johannesson, to visit Moscow on May 9, 2020, to participate in celebrating the 75th anniversary of Victory.
We noted regular positive interaction between our respective foreign ministries.
Iceland presides over the Arctic Council (AC) from 2019 to 2021, and Russia will take the presidency afterwards.

Today, we exchanged detailed views on how to build this key Arctic forum’s activities. We are on the same page regarding most issues.

We have just signed the Joint Statement, which emphasises and symbolises the continuity of the AC presidencies of Iceland and Russia.
We discussed a number of international problems, the situation in Syria, Ukraine and Iran, our interaction at the UN Human Rights Council and other UN-related matters.

We agreed to keep in touch. The minister invited me to visit Iceland.

I would like to do so.
We will agree on the specific steps to make such a visit possible.
Question: The number of non-Arctic countries wishing to take part in Arctic exploration is continually growing.
What do you think about the potential expansion of the Arctic Council?
Sergey Lavrov: Indeed, many countries are interested in this region.

The Arctic Council members are not opposed to the cooperation of non-Arctic countries in implementing many projects in the north, in the high altitudes.
There are no plans to increase the membership of the Arctic Council.
Nobody has suggested this.
Any country can receive observer status, and 13 states already have it.
We do not have any objections to other countries’ practical, non-politicised participation in the work of the council provided they fully respect the fundamental decisions made by the Arctic Eight.
Question: The Syrian Democratic Forces are again accusing Turkey of violating its commitments on the security zone. They interpret Turkey’s military operation in the area of Ayn Issa as Ankara’s striving to establish control over the M4 international motorway.
What does Moscow think about these developments?
Sergey Lavrov: We have no information on Turkey’s intention to violate the October 22 Russia-Turkey memorandum.
I would like to advise the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Kurdish political leaders in general to fulfil what they have promised,
because immediately after signing this memorandum on October 22 of this year, we secured support for its implementation by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the Kurdish leaders that enthusiastically promised to cooperate.
Several days later the United States changed its position and announced its withdrawal from Syria but forgot that it had to protect oil fields from being seized by the Syrian government.
At that point the Kurdish leaders instantly lost their enthusiasm for cooperating in the Sochi agreements and again placed their bets on US patronage.

Nothing good will happen if they hold this position.
They should understand one absolute truth: the rights of the Syrian Kurds can only be ensured on condition of Syria’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
For this purpose they should start a real, comprehensive dialogue with the Syrian government.
When the Americans announced their withdrawal from Syria, the Kurds suddenly expressed a willingness for this dialogue but then later, again switched over to a somewhat unconstructive position.
I would advise our Kurdish colleagues to be consistent and not to engage in dubious activities for considerations of expediency.
Question: There are concerns that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is again preparing to stage a provocation with the use of chemical weapons in Idlib.
What do you think about the recent report by the OPCW Director-General on Douma?
Sergey Lavrov: We regularly receive reports on preparations for provocations in Idlib.
This information is confirmed in most cases.
We make it public jointly with the Syrian government and maybe this is why these provocations have not been staged.
That said, we know that they are being prepared and that provocateurs from the so-called White Helmets take a direct part in these preparations,
which were established and led by British secret services with the support of some Western countries, including the United States.
I think it is absolutely obvious to everyone that the White Helmets took part in several staged events, including those in eastern Ghouta in April 2018.
The facts that have been presented to expose these provocateurs were more than convincing.
We discuss them in the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
A conference of the participants in the Chemical Weapons Convention is taking place now.
There is no escape from the facts that show the dishonesty of many experts in this organization, who have prepared reports on Douma in Syria and a number of other questionable stories.
We are hoping that the OPCW Director-General and the other staff members will be strictly guided by an unbiased attitude and will not take specific instructions from any country.
At this point we doubt that the OPCW executives are abiding by these principles.

Question: The WADA Compliance Review Committee recommends suspending Russia from international competitions for four years.
How would this affect the country’s image? Do you consider this fair?
Sergey Lavrov: To begin with, this is just a recommendation by the committee for now.
It must be reviewed by the Foundation Board.
I would not rush to a hasty conclusion.
There are those who want to put Russia on the defensive, accused by everyone, anywhere, in any area of international life, in conflicts, the economy, power supplies, gas pipelines, and trade in military products.

Russia is ever violating or doing something that doesn’t benefit one or several Western countries.
They believe that the more accusations like this are made, the better for their anti-Russia reasoning. We know perfectly well that it is these countries that engineer such situations.
We will uphold the need for an honest conversation on any issue with a view to ensuring an unbiased review of the actions of every country in the international arena.
It is hard to imagine this situation where one or two countries (for example, Russia and China) are responsible for anything and violating everything while every other country follows the rules which they have written themselves without asking anyone, and compels others to respect these rules.
We respect international law, which primarily implies justice and equality.
Everyone must explain his actions, but rarely do we get sensible explanations that conform to international law, from our Western partners.


Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s interview with TASS news agency, Moscow, April 29, 2020
Question: This is our first online interview.
How familiar are you with this format by now? I know you are holding meetings, and even met with your BRICS colleagues via this format.
How much more time, do you think, will we have to work online?
Sergey Lavrov: It’s anyone’s guess. It’s unusual, but fun.
As we have repeatedly pointed out, online meetings will never replace face-to-face meetings, especially confidential meetings, but nevertheless, using modern technology in these circumstances is a convenient approach because people must continue to talk to each other.
Indeed, in addition to telephone conversations, which have always been part of our diplomatic activity, we are now increasingly using video conferencing.
A video conference with the BRICS foreign ministers took place yesterday. 
Russia chairs this association this year.
Tomorrow, we will hold a Normandy format videoconference with foreign ministers, where we will discuss who is acting, or not acting, on the recommendations approved at the Normandy Four summit in Paris in December 2019, and how they are proceeding.
Next week, after the holidays, we will continue to use this format.
I’m not sure how long this will last.
The health authorities will decide on this based on the actual epidemiological situation.
These evaluations are used to compile reports for international leaders.
As you may be aware, governments around the world are thinking about the time when they will be able to start putting together measures to exit the crisis.
Related instructions were issued yesterday by President Putin at a meeting with the governors.
So we are now in the hands of Mother Nature and the efforts that people are making so nature does not cause too much harm.
Question: Unfortunately, the pandemic is leaving its mark on our lives and, in some ways, has greatly darkened the upcoming Victory Day on May 9.
We are ten days away from it.
However, President Putin said an aerial parade would take place. Of course, there will be fireworks as well.
Frankly, the holiday will look a little different.
We were expecting many foreign guests to come here.
Given the circumstances, how can Victory Day - a great holiday that no one will ever take away from us - be celebrated internationally?
Sergey Lavrov: I completely agree with you. First, none of the foreign guests has yet said they will not come to Moscow for the parade when the new date is set.
All foreign guests, including the heads of state and governments, as well as a large group of WWII foreign veterans, have shown understanding for President Putin’s decision, announced in mid-April, on the need to reschedule the parade, which will be held in full, as he emphasised, this year.
We are proceeding from the premise that the guests who confirmed their participation for May 9 will, of course, consider the possibility of coming to Moscow on a new date. 
Of course, one cannot ignore the international celebrations for the 75th anniversary of Victory in World War II, the Great Patriotic War.
As you may be aware, the UN adopts a corresponding resolution every five years.
Five years ago, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Victory, the General Assembly adopted a resolution by consensus, which emphasised the enduring nature of this feat, and pointed out that the UN was created thanks to Victory, in which Charter says that saving future generations from the disasters of war is its main goal.

Just a few days ago, President Putin and President Trump marked another milestone in the march of the victors - a meeting on the Elbe River.
I believe this was a very important and emotionally charged message telling us that we must put security interests and the interests of saving lives, rather than some geopolitical considerations, above all.
In addition to the functions and statements I mentioned, a draft resolution by the UN General Assembly is being prepared, this time on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of Victory in World War II.
The CIS states, China and a number of other UN member countries co-authored it.
We hoped to be able to time the adoption of this resolution to Victory Day.
Like five years ago during the 70th anniversary, the plan was to have a special discussion at the plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly.
Like other UN agencies, the General Assembly is now working remotely and isn’t holding large meetings, or small ones, for that matter.
We have reached an agreement with our partners who co-sponsored this resolution that we will be aiming for the time when the General Assembly resumes its normal work and then convene such a meeting.
Exhibits and film screenings were planned, not only at the New York-based UN headquarters, but our foreign missions elsewhere as well.
Of course, one way or another, there will be commemorative functions on Victory Day dedicated to those who fought against Nazism.
We instructed our foreign missions, Ambassadors and Consul Generals to organise, with consideration for the requirements of the local epidemiological authorities and the epidemiological situation, visits to the memorial sites in commemoration of the Soviet soldiers who fell on WWII battlefields.
The burial sites will, as always, be maintained in proper condition.
A series of events with exhibits and media events will, of course, take place, but given the circumstances, most of them will most likely be held online.
Rest assured that one way or another this date will be properly marked by all of our foreign missions.
Question: More and more people are saying that this current global situation will change the world order, and that the world will be different.
So as the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, as a major diplomat, what do you think the new world order will be like? What specifically will be different?
Sergey Lavrov: I do not think anyone can give a definite answer at this stage.
There are at least two trends, but there may be more.
The first trend is many countries, leaders, political scientists, politicians, and public figures advocating the need to combine efforts and in every way promote multilateral approaches to global problems because isolationism, attempts to maintain distance from global problems, hiding behind national ‘fences’, have failed.
And the second trend suggests exactly the opposite: where it is impossible to rely on a government in a particular region, where the healthcare system is not well-developed, where agencies that must ensure order and monitor people’s movement are not doing too well, one had better fend for themselves.
If my country is wealthier than many, I can just take care of my problems and let the rest struggle as they can.
Of course, I am a supporter of the first approach, as is the Russian Federation.
Russia has always advocated the need to combine efforts and use collective methods for solving any problems.
The biggest danger would probably be, when we emerge from this pandemic, still not having any agreement at all on how to act in case of a new global threat.
In this sense, what is happening now is so important, including on platforms such as the UN, the WHO, and the G20.
All of these organisations, represented by their leaders — UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and the leaders of G20 currently chaired by Saudi Arabia — have called for pooling efforts and launching a large multilateral programme.

Firstly, the programme focuses on developing an antidote to such infections and threats.
Secondly, on providing assistance to those who need it (substantial assistance, for that matter).
And, thirdly, on organisational measures to quickly mobilise the international community, when, God forbid, something like this happens again.
This programme has been launched.
It was supported by the EU and Saudi Arabia as chair of the G20 and it is designed to run for years.
The announced amount of investment is 7. billion dollars.
The specifics are open to additional consideration and study in order to understand how such multilateral interaction could be arranged in the most convenient way for each country.
But the fact that we need such a programme is not questioned by anyone.
As long as we are talking about multilateralism, I would like to emphasise something I spoke about quite recently.
It must be understood that only combining efforts universally is the right answer, a system that takes into account the interests of all parties.
Over the past couple of years, we have been observing attempts to present multilateralism in a slightly different way: as the right of a certain group of countries to formulate a policy on a particular global issue and then make everyone else join something that was not developed in a universal format.
Germany and France launched an initiative last year to create an alliance for multilateralism. And they did it outside the UN, outside its organisational structure.
Now we have a question: how can anything be established on Earth that would be more multilateral than the UN? Those attempts to promote the approaches I mentioned, to present the matter in a way that suggests multilateralism is determined by more advanced democracies (this is what they obviously say between the lines), mean only one thing.

When these states come with their initiatives to the UN, they find out that they need to take into account other opinions, to modify their approaches and seek compromise and consensus, but this, apparently, is not what they want to invest effort in.
All they want is to push for their unilateral approaches that do not take into account the position of others.
Well, this is how these ideas emerge about creating some special interest alliances outside universal bodies such as the UN, and then present these alliances’ decisions as the ultimate truth.
This is the approach that we take issue with.
We tell our Western, including European, colleagues that any problems must be resolved fairly and opposition should not be feared.
Like it or not, there are 193 UN members in the world.
If we all annually reaffirm our loyalty to the ideals of the UN Charter, then let our work be based on its principles, the main one being the sovereign equality of states.
Question: Do you think that behind these attempts to create such alliances and attacks on existing UN institutions, and the WHO (US President Donald Trump said it must be reformed in a conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron), with statements about the inefficiency of the UN as a whole during the pandemic, “the new world order” (about which I spoke) that these are attempts to establish new international agencies under the pretext of reform? To what extent is the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia as a whole committed to maintaining the existing institutions, of course with due consideration for new realities?

Sergey Lavrov: We have always advocated a careful attitude towards the UN-centric world arrangement that was created after World War II.
We have not invented anything more stable or reliable.
The UN system has unique legitimacy.
It is also unique in embracing the problems that the UN itself, its specialised agencies, funds and programs are tackling.
It would certainly be unforgivable to lose the wealth of its multilateral mechanisms that reflect the interests of all the member countries in this global organisation.
There is no doubt that nothing lasts forever under the Moon and nobody is perfect, as we all know. So, questions about reform and improving UN activity and its agencies are always on the agenda during the meetings of the inter-government and interstate bodies that run these structures and determine the work of their secretariats.
This applies to the WHO that is continuously accumulating new experience.
After each new epidemic and infectious disease it receives specialists and knowledge that are immediately put to use. 
New organisational units are established.
This applies to any other international organisation, including the UN Security Council where the issues of reform are considered in a geopolitical context with a view to making it more representative.
To achieve this, it is necessary to focus primarily on representation from the developing nations from all regions – Asia, Africa and Latin America.
The agenda of multilateral organisations is always aimed at improving their work. 
Any reform is not a one-time action. It is a continuous process because life goes on.
It would be unwise and misguided to grow rigid and refuse to improve the opportunity for response from the international community to current challenges.
As for new organisations, there are no counter indications to any initiatives in this respect.
But if an organisation is established based on its regional location or political affiliation as is the case with the alliances you mentioned, where Europeans and other Westerners create them outside the UN, this is a different story.
Of course, we cannot accept their attempts to create a structure with a limited number of members (only those whom they consider democracies) but claim to resolve problems for the rest of humanity.
With respect to your profession, there are quite a few examples of “an alliance being established for securing democracy” with the obvious message that there are “media and there are propaganda agencies.” Russia Today and Sputnik are obviously in the latter category.
If the alliance that was declared assumes responsibility for resolving issues and assessing the activity of others, it will not be acceptable.
UNESCO and different OSCE agencies deal with these issues.
So, new organisations are okay if they are created without encroaching on the prerogatives of the existing universal structures that rely on the UN Charter that is approved by everyone.
Question: In September, the United Nations will be 75 years old.
I talked with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about this.
Large celebrations for this anniversary were planned for the traditional high level week of the UN General Assembly. Guests of honour were expected to attend.


As you said, it is difficult to predict anything now.
What if the situation does not allow the participants to meet face to face in the UN building? Are there any consultations on how this anniversary, which is important for the world, will be celebrated if it’s not possible to hold a full session in the UN Headquarters in New York?
Sergey Lavrov: We still believe it is too early to make these forecasts.
For the time being, we hope that our plans will be carried out (I am referring to a festive session during the high and top level week in New York in the last ten days of September).
A declaration devoted to the 75th UN anniversary is being drafted; concerts, exhibitions and film shows are being planned.
We are planning similar events in Moscow with the participation of the UN Information Centre and the UN Association of Russia.
Returning to planned UN events, I would like to emphasise again that for now we are all hoping that it will soon be clear whether it will be possible to hold UN General Assembly sessions, including the high-level week, in the usual format.
Question: If you please, I would like to go back to a topic which is crucial for all of us – the pandemic.
As the fight against this terrible epidemic unfolds, there is an increasing number of those who want to determine who is responsible, investigate its origin. Various commissions have been set up including in the US Senate, there are many journalist investigations.
More and more fingers are pointing at China.
There are different kinds of conspiratorial inquiries in the US, there are alleged eggheads who are looking for the origin of the pandemic in Russia of all places.
Should we already begin thinking about how to study and investigate this situation after the pandemic? How could this be done? Or should we draw a line and focus on combating the pandemic, leaving the investigation for the distant future?
Sergey Lavrov: First of all, I would like to say that we are sad about the rhetoric used, about attempts to point fingers at a certain country.
You mentioned that the US is accusing China.
Accusations against the People’s Republic of China are also heard in Europe, they were made in France and Germany.
Statements are made that European countries are allegedly willing to demand tens or hundreds of billions dollars from China as compensation for failing to timely inform the world community.
US President Donald Trump addressed this issue recently during a news conference and said that the US might also make such claims but much bigger than hundreds of billions US dollars.

We see all that.
And it is certainly unfortunate.
As you have just said, the key is to overcome the pandemic, and afterwards it is certainly necessary to investigate the causes of its emergence so as to work out an “antidote” to rely on in future.
There are forecasts by scientists that this particular coronavirus may return and stay with us forever just like the flu or a number of seasonal diseases.
And so it is certainly necessary to find out the causes.
But not for the sake of being able to say “I was right.
This is who is to blame.
I did everything right, so go and vote for me” but for the sake of understanding of how to figure out the best approaches to overcoming this threat in future.
If we look at the actions being taken by the UN system, to be honest, I do not see anything blameworthy because the actions taken were fairly prompt and I think they were well-timed.
One can always say, “You could have done something a day earlier.
First, the UN system’s organisations are not something detached from its member states, they are set up and governed by the states, they have executive and managing bodies.
The secretariats of these organisations are made up of citizens of the member states whereby the larger the country, its GDP and membership dues, the more citizens of that country make up the secretariat of that organisation. 
This is also true of the World Health Organisation.
If we take the timeline of WHO action since January of this year, it convincingly shows that the Organisation was acting in full compliance with its Charter.

And one more important consideration.
The Organisation is not entitled to establish a certain regime in its member states.
It issues recommendations.
Even when the WHO declared the coronavirus emergency, it was a recommendation to the others.
The Organisation could not have ordered everyone to declare a state of emergency.
Each country, in view of the situation on the ground, either followed or disregarded this recommendation.
This is a critical point that must be understood.
The WHO is not alone in this work because there is also the UN Development Programme, UNICEF, UN Population Fund, Food and Agriculture (FAO), United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).
Each of them had and has programmes to support the needy in developing countries, programmes that help improve, even if slightly, the socioeconomic situation of people, especially the poorest ones.

The impact on the developing countries without such support would have been much more destructive, as they have so far managed to keep the pandemic from striking deep in their societies.
Question: You recently said that an online summit of the leaders of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, devoted to the coronavirus, was basically set.
Is there a date or some hints when the five leaders of Russia, China, the USA, the UK and France will be able to go online and join forces in the fight against the coronavirus?
Sergey Lavrov: I have already spoken on this subject.
We are ready for such a conversation.
We believe that for the five leaders it will be important to make a joint statement with assessments and tasks concerning how we see the interests of the world community in joining forces to fight the coronavirus.
The draft of such a statement is almost finished.
We were ready to gather last week, and this one too, but some of the five leaders asked for extra time to determine their policies.
Question: So, the date has not yet been set, has it?
Sergey Lavrov: No, it has not.
I would like to emphasise once again that this video conference of the five leaders will be devoted exclusively to the fight against the coronavirus in furtherance and in support of the decisions taken by the UN General Assembly, the G20, and the World Health Organisation on a consensus basis.
At the same time, we continue to prepare for the main summit of the leaders of the UN Security Council permanent member states, which was proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in January 2020. This initiative was supported by all the leaders of the other UN Security Council permanent members.
Now we are working on the conceptual content of this summit.
There is agreement, an understanding that it should be devoted to all the key problems of the modern world, strategic stability and global security in all its dimensions, including military, political, economic and humanitarian.
It will focus on all pressing tasks on the world community’s agenda today, on how the five permanent members of the UN Security Council can exercise in the present conditions the responsibility that the UN Charter has entrusted them with.


Question: With the pandemic, the Foreign Ministry had to take on a new role, helping our compatriots return home and coordinating these efforts.
On this front, the Ministry has gone to great lengths, working around the clock.

TASS news agency covered these developments and saw that the Foreign Ministry has done a great deal, but has been facing criticism which I believe to be unjustified.
Where are we at this point in time? How many people are still stranded abroad and are waiting to be repatriated? What could be the solution to this problem in the short term, in your opinion?
Sergey Lavrov: This type of activity is not new to us.
There have always been situations when our compatriots found themselves in challenging circumstances while abroad. Of course, this has never happened on such a scale.

We have been facing a tense situation with the coronavirus outbreak.
Some people had left Russia for a long-term period, to study or as interns, while others were travelling as tourists.
We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people.
This is a challenging situation, since it is not just about a Russian citizen who must return home, it is his constitutional right.
There are also circumstances that are directly linked to the coronavirus outbreak in the Russian Federation.
The country’s authorities and the Government Emergency Response Centre to Prevent the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus in the Russian Federation have adopted decisions primarily designed to minimise the negative implications from the ongoing pandemic. Preserving the life and health of the Russian people is the main priority.
This vision underpinned the parameters for repatriating Russian nationals in terms of their numbers and the regions where they intended to return.
This is extremely challenging work that requires multiple agencies to constantly coordinate their efforts in order to develop a special algorithm and improve it through trial and error, since mistakes are unavoidable in situations of this kind.
You mentioned that we have been facing some criticism.

It is always useful and never one hundred percent unjustified or unfair.
There is always a grain of truth in it.
It is therefore essential for everyone to understand that when helping Russians we follow the government guidelines on countering this threat as well as measures taken at the federal level.
We can understand the feelings people have when they cannot board a plane home.

But you also have to understand what I just said: there is a government policy whereby people have to submit the required information, while also taking into consideration specific factors on the ground.
The Foreign Ministry advised the Government Emergency Response Centre to make important adjustments to the repatriation algorithm that guides our actions.
The Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation is in charge of approving repatriation lists based on the information submitted through the Government Services portal.
Based on the experience from this scheme, as well as recommendations from our ambassadors and consuls general, we submitted a proposal to the Government whereby our ambassadors would be vested with the authority to add people to the repatriation lists regardless of whether they are on the list compiled by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, or face a dire humanitarian situation or not.

A repatriation flight has just returned from New York with 257 people on board, including 90 people from the so-called humanitarian list on which they were placed by Russian Ambassador to the United States.

As I express my gratitude to our diplomats I cannot fail to mention that many ambassadors, embassy and consular staff members have come up with creative and unconventional solutions.

For example, in Nepal the ambassador and his staff have set up a tent camp at the Russian Centre of Science and Culture in Kathmandu to provide accommodation for those who did not have any money left.
In New York, Nepal and Argentina, and in almost all countries, embassy employees have been using their personal funds to buy basic necessities and provide food for our stranded compatriots.
The plane from New York finally brought home 19 school students who were taking part in some shady programmes in the United States, about which Russian Goverment did not know anything.
We have yet to receive a clear and detailed explanation to this effect from our US colleagues.
The US Ambassador to Russia John J. Sullivan attempted an explanation, saying that there was no need to worry, since some students have already returned home, some no longer wanted to leave, some were with their host families, while others were transferred somewhere else.


These explanations are unacceptable to us.
We need to know the location of every underage citizen, of every school student, where they are and why they are there.
We also have to understand how minors were able to get on an international flight.
We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we are working on it together with the Russian Education Ministry.
There is one more point I wanted to make.
The Government has promptly taken a decision regarding Russians who have so far been unable to board repatriation flights and have run out of money, since they did not plan to stay abroad for so long, and were unable to return home.
The Government allocated funds, and the Foreign Ministry has been distributing them following the corresponding guidelines in order to support our compatriots as long as they are abroad.
There are per diem payments for adults and children.
This is also a big support.
Let me reiterate that nobody is perfect, and a lot of things had to be done without any preparations, in keeping with the decisions taken at the federal level and considering how many people we were able to take back to the Russian regions of their destination.
I would like to once again thank our colleagues from other agencies, and all those who work at the Emergency Response Centre for their constructive approach to dealing with the concerns raised by our foreign missions.
I would also like to extend my special gratitude to our diplomats abroad.
They have done everything to offer maximum comfort to Russian nationals stranded abroad, and have volunteered their personal time to do so.
Question: I join you in your words of acknowledgement but I also would like to ask you about one very important thing.
True, this is more about your forecasts and assumptions.
The world is closed, borders are closed and there are no flights.
I can only address this question to you.
When will borders open? When will flights resume? When will people start to interact normally again? Proceeding from your forecasts, views, understanding and conversations with your colleagues, when and how will the world start opening back up? Borders are closed even between the CIS countries, not to mention farther abroad.
How gradually or quickly will this happen in practical terms?
Sergey Lavrov: We already spoke about this at the beginning of our conversation.
In practical terms, whether this is fortunate or not, the Foreign Ministry is an executive body that is not obliged to make a decision on this score.
It must be made on a collective basis.
I would like to emphasise once again that during his regular meetings with the regions and government members and academia, President of Russia Vladimir Putin is continuously setting tasks the implementation of which will make it easier to decide on criteria, timeframe, phasing and speed of lifting the current strict stay-at-home orders.
As you know, the President instructed his colleagues to submit proposals to this effect by May 5, 2020.
They should take into account the collective views of the federal executive bodies and the specific situation in every region.
We are hoping that these measures will set a timeframe that will make it possible to carry out most of what was planned for this year in Russian diplomacy.
Question: You know the famous photo, the best photo of the 20th century, which was taken by TASS photo correspondent Yevgeny Khaldei. It is called “Victory Banner over Reichstag.”
I am putting this question to you because you liked taking photos at one time.
If you took a photo of the future victory over the pandemic, what would it depict?
Sergey Lavrov: This is a very good question for a world contest.
I suggest you patent this idea.
Question: May I ask you straightaway to head the contest’s organising committee?
Sergey Lavrov: We will see.
If this idea gains traction and the organising committee is established, I will think about joining it.
I know that this photo must not depict any building symbolising some country.
Question: I recently bought an interesting photo album. It contains many of your photos.
Since the pandemic victory contest will be international, which of your photos would you add to the future album? I mean expressly your photo.
Sergey Lavrov: I would add a photo that has not yet been taken.
We have a wonderful photographer in the ministry, Eduard Pesov.
We will meet on the day of victory over the pandemic and will try to take photos of all our friends.
We will see how they will look on this remarkable day.
Question: I will take you at your word.
Thank you!

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s statement and answers to media questions at a news conference following an extraordinary meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations, Moscow, April 28, 2020
Thank you for participating in our resumed meetings that are right now taking place online.
It is in our interests to inform you about the work that we are continuing to do with our foreign partners under the current circumstances.
We have just finished a very constructive videoconference of the BRICS foreign ministers, held at the initiative of the Russian Federation. We hold the BRICS Chairmanship this year.
Since a whole number of events had to be postponed due to the spread of the coronavirus, we decided to hold an extraordinary BRICS meeting and discuss how our five countries can contribute to the international efforts against this threat.
This videoconference does not cancel the main full-scale Foreign Ministers Council meeting scheduled for June.


These dates are still on the calendar but, of course, if required we may adjust them based on the epidemiological situation.
As I have already mentioned, today we spoke about our countries’ action to counter the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Our partners acknowledged the fact that Russia’s initiative came at the right time.
We had a productive conversation.
Of course, the main focus of our discussion was on increasing the efficiency of our countries’ efforts in fighting the threat.
We covered the mechanisms for improving the exchange of experience and information, as well as providing mutual aid and deploying multilateral mechanisms.
In addition to the direct preventive action, we analysed the impact of the current crisis on international relations.
We established that there is no other alternative but to seek collective responses to any related challenges and no other alternative but to take a multilateral approach and to pursue equal, non-politicised cooperation of sovereign states in addressing all topical issues on today’s agenda.
These efforts (and we spoke about this at length during the meeting) are being obstructed by illegitimate, unilateral and coercive measures – the so-called sanctions that are being imposed in contravention of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council and contrary to international law.
Under the current circumstances, these unilateral restrictions which, again, violate international law are holding back the measures against the coronavirus outbreak and are significantly damaging the socioeconomic development of the respective states.

We support the appeal by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet who are calling for the unilateral sanctions that were imposed bypassing the United Nations to be suspended at the least and ideally lifted, so that we could respond to the demands of our time more efficiently.
We have also discussed additional steps taken by BRICS to deepen the five-way partnership at international organisations, including the UN, the G20, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to name just a few.

Our common position is that under these mechanisms, BRICS partnership should enhance the role and responsibility of the global governance institutions and their further democratisation.
They should promote the interests of the majority of the countries, ideally, all of them.
Today, we also discussed the BRICS New Development Bank which made a principled decision to create a dedicated lending tool to finance economic recovery projects in the BRICS countries.
Up to $15 billion will be allocated to this end. We believe this should help our economies overcome the crisis and resume full-fledged economic activity.
Russia has stated its specific joint crisis response measures to fight the coronavirus infection.


This is a fairly large package of measures relating not only to the healthcare sector, but also to the economy, trade, financial stability and employment support.
In the near future we will put these ideas down on paper.
We agreed that we will submit them for substantive discussion at the upcoming meetings of the relevant departments of the five countries.
Overall, we believe that the changes experienced by the international community pose a threat of new dividing lines, more conflicts and a wider gap between the rich and poor countries.
We are witnessing a rapid increase in the importance of innovative technology, especially in the IT sphere, which makes the well-known initiatives that Russia is promoting at the UN even more relevant. These initiatives concern ensuring international information security and developing a universal tool to combat cybercrime.
Overall, and we pointed this out today, multilateral institutions and the nation states themselves are taking a sort of a test for what we call professional aptitude.
It is critically important not to try to focus on the fleeting electoral or any other interests in an attempt to politicise a particular issue, but to see the goal of our entire community in joining efforts in order to ensure the most positive outcome of our current efforts for our five countries and, above all, their citizens.
Question: Will the BRICS countries work together to create a vaccine against the coronavirus? This was mentioned in the Ufa Declaration of 2015, but will any real work be done in this area now? Has India announced the time for its hydroxychloroquine supplies to Russia?
Sergey Lavrov: In the declaration of the 2015 Ufa summit that you mentioned, the purported goal was to start working together on developing and using vaccines, including against coronavirus infections.
This task was formulated back then politically and specified in 2018 during the BRICS summit held in Johannesburg.
The Johannesburg summit documents contain an agreement to create an appropriate five-way mechanism.
Today we analysed this situation and decided to emphasise the need for the speedy implementation of this agreement and the creation of such a mechanism.
The Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Healthcare are involved in dealing with other issues, including the supply of vaccines.
A videoconference of economic experts from the BRICS countries will be held tomorrow. On May 7, experts from healthcare ministries will hold a videoconference as well.
I think they will discuss specific aspects of cooperation that you just mentioned. 
We will keep you posted.
Question: Are the BRICS countries ready to take upon themselves the US contribution to the World Health Organisation after Washington decided to suspend its funding?
Sergey Lavrov: We share the opinion that the WHO is a critically important tool which has now become an unparalleled platform for gathering information and facts from various states.

This agency brings together top professionals from all countries, without exception, including the United States.
As the main contributor to the WHO budget, the United States had the largest quota of its specialists working at the WHO Secretariat.
The WHO contributions come in two forms -mandatory and voluntary.
As far as I understand, Washington has suspended the payment of voluntary contributions, but has retained and continues to pay the mandatory part that gives it the right to vote in this organisation.
With regard to compensation, since we are talking about voluntary contributions (the United States has suspended its voluntary contributions), it is hard to say who is going to support the WHO and how.
China, for example, has announced an additional $30 million to be paid to the WHO budget.
Russia played a decisive role in developing the vaccine during the Ebola outbreak. Special institutes were created in African countries, which bore the brunt of this fever. 
We will continue to support the WHO regardless of what other countries might say about its activities.
Question: Has the date for holding an online summit of the heads of the Group of Five - permanent members of the UN Security Council and the final statement of the leaders been agreed upon?
Sergey Lavrov: The videoconference of the leaders of the countries - permanent members of the UN Security Council will be devoted to the coronavirus.
So far, the date has not been set.
We were ready to hold it this week.
As far as I know, there are some countries that need more time to study the situation.
Question: Recently, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov noted in an interview that back at the 2015 BRICS summit in Ufa, the final declaration included a statement that we need to pay attention to cooperation in combating novel coronavirus strains.
What made Russia raise this issue five years ago? What can we do today?
What do you think about China and Russia’s interaction in combating the coronavirus?
Sergey Lavrov: Are you saying Russia predicted the current epidemic before Bill Gates?

Seriously, though, in 2015, humanity was facing pandemic threats, including those associated with the coronavirus, such as MERS - the so-called Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, and SARS - a severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Not surprisingly, our researchers and specialists could tell back then that the coronaviruses could resurge.
As I already mentioned, today we reiterated our interest in creating, as soon as possible and in accordance with the decisions of the Ufa and Johannesburg summits, a mechanism for developing and using a vaccine against the coronaviruses.
As for our evaluation of the Russia-China interaction in fighting the coronavirus, we believe that it deserves high praise.
From the outset, we provided assistance to Wuhan in China, and I hope we have made our contribution to China overcoming this threat fairly quickly.
Now Beijing is helping everyone, including our country, to curb the spread of this infection.
As our respective leaders, President Putin and President Xi have repeatedly stated , we will continue our interaction and strategic partnership across all areas and pay special attention to the current important tasks in order to curb this global threat.

Question: In almost every answer, you mention some kind of joint coronavirus response action - cooperation within BRICS or bilateral cooperation between Russia and China.
This is one side, one opinion.
The other is found in the new European External Action Service report that says China and Russia are responsible for spreading misinformation about the novel coronavirus.

How is such a contrast even possible? What are your comments regarding this?
Sergey Lavrov: When we talk about cooperation with China, we cite facts.
There are many of them.
We are not hiding them from anyone.
They include specific forms of assistance: the delivery of humanitarian supplies, medicine and testing kits, medical specialists were dispatched, there were mutual consultations and many more things.
As for the EEAS statements about the coronavirus misinformation our two countries are allegedly disseminating, I cannot even give you any proper comments because they do not include a single fact confirming these allegations that I could mention.
Actually, we are not asking them for facts.
We are already accustomed to our Western colleagues’ increasing attempts to find some unifying motives in pulp fiction about the Russian or some other threat.
So far, we have not been confronted with one single fact confirming any allegations of our interference in the US elections, the Brexit referendum in the UK, the referendum in Catalonia, let alone the notorious Skripal case or the MH-17 crash investigation.
Now they are accusing us of trying to poison someone in the Czech Republic with some substance that someone brought in a suitcase, and the concerned Czech authorities are aware of this, but for some reason no one yet has shown the suitcase.
I am taking these things now philosophically.
If the EU needs this kind of insinuation to somehow cover up its internal problems, what can we do about it? The pure lack of any specific evidence behind this is obvious once you simply look at the facts that are regularly published covering each country’s coronavirus response actions.
Question: In the wake of Libyan National Army Commander Marshal Khalifa Haftar’s recent remarks, does Russia have any leverage on him? Is it possible to develop collective measures to enforce peace and return to talks on the Libyan settlement? How dangerous are such remarks for the future of the Libyan settlement?

Sergey Lavrov: I wouldn’t talk here about any leverage that Russia may have.
We have contacts with all actors in the Libya conflict, without exception, including Marshal Khalifa Haftar, Chairman of the Presidential Council Fayez al-Sarraj, and President of the Libyan House of Representatives Aguila Saleh, as well as other figures, including the High Council of State’s senior officials.

Many bodies have been created under the agreement concluded in Skhirat in December 2015.
At all stages of the settlement of the Libya crisis and in the course of all the initiatives advanced by our French and Italian colleagues, and the UAE at various points (an International Conference on Libya was held in Berlin), we warned about the need, first, to convince the conflicting parties to agree on the terms that they will use to resolve the problems in their country, the statehood of which was destroyed, as you may recall, in 2011 in the wake of absolutely unlawful NATO aggression.
We have always warned against the attempts to impose on the Libyan parties any documents or agreements drafted without their direct involvement, since the non-viability of this approach has been proven on many occasions.

Now, we are faced with a repetition of what has already been done in relation to the outcome of the Berlin Conference.
When the final document was submitted for approval by the participants, President Putin specifically asked whether the conflicting parties, primarily, Khalifa Haftar and Fayez al-Sarraj, supported this document.
We were told that this matter would be addressed later.
We said that without the clearly expressed consent of the Libyan parties, there was little chance that the agreements reached among external players would be viable.
Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened.
But this does not mean that the conflicting parties should now make aggressive statements, announce unilateral decisions or refuse to conduct an intra-Libyan dialogue.
We did not approve recent statements by al-Sarraj who refused to talk with Khaftar.
Neither one of them is contributing to the achievement of a lasting compromise, which is crucial if we want to overcome this situation.

Here’s a statement made just the other day, which, for some reason, drew little attention from the media, but is in stark contrast to the above.
President of the Libyan House of Representatives Aguila Saleh Issa called for a national dialogue. He wants this dialogue to be aimed at the formation of common government bodies which would represent evenly and equally Libya’s three key regions.
This is exactly what we have been talking about all these years: the Libyans themselves must identify the approaches that they will find generally acceptable, develop a dialogue and then build their new state.
External actors should support such approaches in every way.
I hope that the lessons learned from previous attempts will be learned, and we will be encouraging the Libyans themselves to talk and find a compromise.
In this regard, I cannot neglect to mention the fact that the post of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General Support Mission in Libya has been vacant for over a month now.
Ghassan Salame put a lot of effort into fulfilling his mandate, but, unfortunately, they were not successful, and he resigned.
I believe it is absolutely necessary for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a new special representative soon.
Everyone thinks this should be a representative of Africa.

There are such candidates, and we know them well.
They are experienced people with good standing.
We urge the UN Secretary-General to fill this vacancy as soon as possible and appoint a new special representative so that the process continues uninterrupted.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s opening remarks at the extraordinary meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations, Moscow, April 28, 2020
Good afternoon, colleagues,
I am glad to welcome you in good mood and decent health.
Thank you for your prompt response to our initiative to convene an extraordinary meeting of the BRICS foreign ministers via videoconference to discuss the problems caused by the coronavirus.
During the pandemic the videoconference format is the only possible way of maintaining the dynamics of our cooperation.
But I am convinced that soon, when the situation permits, we will resume meeting in person.
In any event, I will be happy to see you at the next full-scale Foreign Ministers Council meeting in the Russian Federation.
Today, we have agreed to analyse the impact of the crisis underway on the system of international relations. It is testing global political institutions, economic patterns, international agencies and nation states themselves.
This is a complex situation, and one videoconference will not suffice to find answers to all questions. However, this is the right time to start such a dialogue in BRICS.
Today, our priority is dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak.
This is about protecting people’s lives and health.
The need to uphold multilateral principles and rely on international law in formulating solutions to current cross-border threats is a no less urgent challenge.
We are convinced that it is very important today to announce the solidarity of the BRICS countries in support of the emerging democratic, multipolar international order based on mutual respect for the legitimate interests of all states, as well as all the norms and principles of the UN Charter.
I believe that only by pooling our national efforts will we be able to effectively meet current challenges like this pandemic.
I suggest that the BRICS countries closely coordinate their positions, including at international agencies, all the more so since there exist the required mechanisms and venues for this work, first of all, the UN and its agencies, the G20, the WHO and the WTO, to name a few.

We submit for your consideration several Russian initiatives aimed at more effectively responding to the challenges posed by the spread of the coronavirus.
They concern not only safeguarding health but also financial, economic and social issues, labour markets, the welfare of the people and the goals of sustainable development.
We hope we will start actively working together on these initiatives at the level of relevant departments of our five states. 
Cooperation on countering infectious diseases has long been a priority for BRICS.
As you remember, the final declaration of the 2015 BRICS summit in Ufa, Russia, contains instructions by the leaders to jointly work on managing the risk of outbreaks, including of new coronaviruses.
Time has shown that we were on the right track. Today, we should look how our foreign ministries can help our states to develop practical cooperation between health ministries.
Of course, the quarantine measures due to COVID-19 have adjusted the calendar of BRICS events in 2020.

Some of these events that were scheduled for April and May were postponed but BRICS will continue its cooperation via videoconferences.

We will tell you about the vision for our future work during the Russian chairmanship.
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s remarks and answers during a video lecture at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University), Moscow, April 27, 2020
Mr Torkunov,
MGIMO University is rapidly making the switch to new technologies in the face of the real restrictions the coronavirus has placed on in-person interactions.
I was told that you had managed to organise the switch very quickly without somehow losing the materials you have to impart, in addition to the knowledge.
I am confident that MGIMO University will do a good job of holding its exam period, the defence of graduation theses and the state final certification.
I hope that you will find a creative way to enroll new students.
I don’t know how the campaign will be organised, but please ask if we can do anything to help you. We will try to be useful.
I do not regard this as a lecture, more like a seminar, perhaps, because I believe it important to focus mainly on the interactive part.
I won’t speak long about how the coronavirus fits into the dramatic changes that have swept across what we call the global geopolitical landscape or how it has affected numerous aspects of interstate relations and international affairs.

The global economy has suffered a strong blow.
According to most expert forecasts, the road to recovery will be long.
Of course, all contacts between people, including humanitarian, educational, scientific and tourist exchanges, have been cancelled for the most part.
Unfortunately, diplomatic opportunities have also narrowed.
I have already had a chance to talk about how much online communication can really replace person-to-person interactions.
This way of communicating can’t really compare with an in-person conversation, face to face.
I think that all of my colleagues miss it, too; at least I regularly talk with many of them on the phone and get the sense that their views and feelings on this mirror my own.
At some point we will have to thoroughly assess and understand the ultimate impact of the pandemic on international affairs and develop comprehensive joint approaches to working in the post-pandemic period.
I believe that at this stage and in subsequent ones we will have the support and contribution of MGIMO University’s academic and expert resources.
We are interested in it.
We still do not fully understand the impact, but perhaps we can draw some conclusions at this stage already.
I think that the main conclusion is that the crisis has clearly shown (if anyone still needed proof) how interconnected and interdependent all countries and all areas of life are in today’s world, without exception.
We have long warned of the danger of underestimating the cross-border nature of numerous threats, including new challenges like international terrorism, the risk of the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and cybercrime.
To these we can add not only the climate processes that have worried many countries for a long time, but also pandemics like the one the world is dealing with now.
I think that one of the main conclusions at this stage is that even the most stubborn sceptics must realise now that nobody can wall off such threats. Trying to act only for yourself, to wait out the storm in your quiet port, so to speak, won’t work. 
Everyone can see this now.
Countries that chose to isolate from the rest of the world and countries that decided to take a more philosophical approach, like Sweden, for example, have suffered to almost the same degree. No one was or will be able to guard against it.
Long before the current events, we were calling on all countries to unite to address cross-border threats that spare no one. It was timely then and is even more so now, because there is clearly a growing demand for the entire world to act together in solidarity.


I hope that the crisis (as the saying goes “every cloud has a silver lining”) will motivate all global political actors, primarily the leading states, to put aside their fleeting differences and work together in a professional manner for the sake of securing a peaceful and prosperous future for all people.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of the United States Donald Trump have given a sign that there is cause for optimism.
Yesterday they released a Joint Statement on the 75th anniversary of meeting on the Elbe, which was the focus.
The Soviet Union and the United States managed to rise above their differences and join forces in a decisive war against a common enemy.
Essentially, the challenge is the same now.
Naturally, we hate to see attempts, which are unfortunately being made, to use the present crisis to advance narrow, selfish and momentary interests, to squabble and settle scores with inconvenient governments or geopolitical rivals.
Again, we do see such attempts.
Naturally, it’s paradoxical when the countries presenting themselves as defenders of human rights and the champions of democracy continue to use an illegitimate tool, the so-called sanctions, in circumvention of the UN Security Council, and are now trying to politicise humanitarian aid during the pandemic which hits especially hard the more vulnerable members of the population that need better access to food, medicine and medical assistance in general.

We reject in principle the illegitimate methods that I am referring to, and moreover, such actions are unacceptable during a worldwide disaster.

As you know, at the G20 Summit, which was also held online, President of Russia Vladimir Putin put forward the initiative to create "green corridors" that would be free of trade wars and sanctions in order to freely supply all those in need the medicines, food, equipment and technology necessary to protect against the coronavirus and overcome this pandemic.
We welcomed the relevant statements by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, who, inter alia, when commenting on the current developments in the world, advocated the lifting or easing of restrictions imposed on certain countries.
First of all, we are talking about countries that are under unilateral sanctions, in addition to UN Security Council sanctions. I mean Syria, Venezuela and North Korea.
A number of other countries also need such relief.
Our Mission to the UN is actively forming a group of like-minded people to make this approach a reality.
We consider it extremely dangerous to try to use the current situation to undermine the UN basic principles and system as a whole, whose specialised agencies remain the only mechanisms of multilateral cooperation in relevant areas.

This fully applies to the WHO activities. We consider the attacks on this Organisation, the attempts to blame it for everything that is happening absolutely counterproductive and unfair.
According to our assessment and that of the overwhelming majority of states, the Organisation acted professionally at all stages of the crisis, taking proactive steps and distributing information and its recommendations to all states.

Let us hope that, when learning the lessons of the ongoing crisis, we will manage to strengthen the UN-centred nature of global architecture following the crisis.
It is clear that there are other agencies, but they all rely on the principles set out in the UN Charter and do very useful work.
I will give special mention to the G20, which includes the G7, BRICS and other large world economies.
The creation and functioning of the G20, in fact, confirms that the Western countries associated with the G7 are simply no longer able to single-handedly address key global problems and reach any meaningful solutions.
This year we are marking the 75th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War, in World War II.
All the nations of the Soviet Union played an essential role in defeating Nazism.
It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this event for all humankind.
Today it is very important for us to not let this heroic deed be forgotten, to prevent young people from forgetting what national egotism, disunity and complicity in any manifestations of chauvinism and xenophobia can lead to.
Unfortunately, we continue to see attempts to rewrite history.
The Foreign Ministry together with other Russian agencies, based on our archives, is doing everything necessary to counter these destructive ideas and to prevent the revision of the international legal results of World War II, including the rulings of the Nuremberg trials.
An absolute majority of the international community shares our positions, which is reaffirmed annually by the UN General Assembly resolution on combating glorification of Nazism that is adopted by an overall majority.
The leaders of the CIS member states adopted a corresponding statement at the highest level, which was circulated at the UN.
Work in this area is also underway at the CSTO.
I hope that MGIMO University, which has long and fruitfully taken part in our common efforts, will continue to make a contribution to our joint work to protect the historical truth and the good name of those who gave their lives to save the world.
The 75th anniversary of the Victory coincides with the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. It was possible to establish the organisation thanks to our common Victory and the spirit of cooperation and alliance between the members of the anti-Hitler coalition.
Of course, today the great powers that made the key contribution to the defeat Nazism and the establishment of the UN have special responsibility, as reflected in the UN Charter.
We are convinced that the contribution of the five [UNSC permanent members] at this crucial stage of world development is relevant to forming the direction for the further progress of interstate relations in the post-crisis era.
In general, in a situation when the world is going through tectonic changes, when the bipolar model, and especially unipolar models, are becoming obsolete, a polycentric international order is forming with several powerful centres of economic growth and financial power, and, of course, political influence comes with economic growth and financial capacities.
This is a long historical era.
This won’t happen over a month or two, or a year.
This is an era when the world is changing, the world that has been developing according to Western models for more than five hundred years whereas now a wider cultural and civilisational diversity must be relied on and taken into account in the global policy.
Considering the role of the five UN permanent members envisaged in its Charter, earlier this year President of Russia Vladimir Putin put forward an initiative to hold a summit of the heads of state and government of the UN Security Council permanent members in order to discuss the entire range of tasks that must be addressed at the highest level in the context of implementing the UN Charter’s principles and goals in today’s circumstances, first of all, to ensure the sovereign equality of states and non-interference in their domestic affairs, as well as a peaceful settlement to conflicts and disputes.

All the other countries’ leaders supported the initiative: first China, then France, the US and finally the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Now we, for obvious reasons, are waiting for a time when it will be possible to begin the practical work to organise such a meeting, because it must be face-to-face.

Everyone agrees on this.
At the same time, the five states are thinking about their contribution to countering the coronavirus.
It has been agreed to hold a videoconference in order to do this. We are deciding on the date now.

When working on establishing a new international order, we continue to rely on the potential of such organisations as the SCO and BRICS.
Of course, we discuss ways to increase the effectiveness of joint efforts in all areas, including regarding the coronavirus, at the EAEU and within the CIS.
In conclusion, I would like to once again thank the MGIMO University management and the teaching staff for their contribution to taking practical steps in implementing Russia’s foreign policy course, as well as to the events to mark the Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
I have listened to the beautiful song recorded by the MGIMO choir.
It really evokes sincere respect and gratitude.
I am ready to answer your questions.
Question: Although the Internet has been with us for a long time, it used to basically duplicate the offline media, whereas now it has become a door, not a window, and we need to build a fully developed interaction space and a new social architecture.
How effectively do you think the Foreign Ministry is capable of responding within a short time? What changes will remain and take place in its structure or in your personal working procedure?
Sergey Lavrov: It is very difficult to predict now what will happen to various organisations and how they will endure the crisis.
NATO and the EU were mentioned earlier.
Any organisation is facing the question how it should organise its work in the future.
This is not only about the methods, which are sure to change due to a greater number of online meetings in our programme of events.
And although meetings in person will certainly remain, there will be a great temptation, given the fairly successful online work, to hold many not too confidential discussions using the new technologies. But let me reiterate that the key importance of talks conducted in person will remain.
The way in which organisations work and the essence of their efforts will definitely change.
There are disputes on what portion of responsibilities in this or that multilateral organisation should be delegated to supranational bodies and what portion should remain the duty of national governments. In addition, it is being debated if some responsibilities should be taken from the supranational bodies out of the ones that were delegated to them earlier.
The argument is that not everything is as clear at the supranational level as it can be from the countries’ capitals.
The pandemic (as publicly stated by many EU members) has clearly shown the need for greater reliance on national opinions and decisions.
Countries understand better what is going in their territory and can take specific actions much quicker and more efficiently, and if need be, which is also very important, to adjust promptly some steps that prove to be ineffective in reality.
So, there will be a lot of debates but the main thing is for us to understand what I said in my opening remarks, namely that from now and until the end of time, the threats that are facing humanity will have absolutely no limits.
Many people did not want to accept this, but now they will have to.
They don’t know these limits; they don’t respect or observe them.
This applies to terrorism, piracy and any other form of organised crime, including drug trafficking.
It also has to do with the rapidly growing possibility that non-governmental entities will be able to get access to weapons of mass destruction.
It has to do with natural disasters, industrial accidents, and, of course, infectious diseases.
The BRICS heads of state adopted a decision a couple of years ago to expand cooperation in the fight against infections and the joint production and use of vaccines.
This week we will have a video conference of the BRICS foreign ministers; among other things we will talk about accelerating the implementation of the mechanism created by the heads of state’ decision.
I will say it again, the most important thing is that these inevitable changes should be considered and agreed based on the logic of our shared destiny and the logic of the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, which implies collective security in all the dimensions of the international environment.
Question: We have got used to the word 'self-isolation,' and use it while addressing people.
Can we say that countries around the globe have self-isolated and that the virus is the sole reason for this? How can deglobalisation ideas advance in future global politics?
Sergey Lavrov: As a term, the word 'self-isolation' was first used many years ago, even decades ago, when referring to a form of the US foreign policy.

Normally, when the Democratic Party rules the US administration, its members always seek a global reach in their foreign policy actions, while members of the Republican Party often choose to tune out and not to spend funds, time or effort promoting different political priorities in remote regions.

During the election campaign, Trump claimed there was nothing to do for the United States in remote countries and regions, and useless wars should be stopped.
Europeans quickly became aware that the US would not take much responsibility for what was taking place in Europe.
The United States seeks tangible and pragmatic goals, such as selling its goods, services and arms.
Donald Trump and his administration insist that all NATO member states should pay at least two percent of their GDP for purchasing armaments, primarily US-made ones.
Currently, amidst the coronavirus pandemic, Germany has been obliged to buy US bombers, which will have to be replaced as their lifespan has expired, instead of European aircraft.
But this time, they will be replaced not by European but by US-made aircraft, although the European industry, particularly the Airbus corporation and other companies, could benefit from such an order and receive dozens of billions of dollars.
But Berlin is purchasing US bombers.
This is probably the result of the policy that I have already mentioned.
Germany will buy these bombers to install US nuclear weapons on them, which are currently stored in Europe (in four countries apart from Germany) and which we believe should be withdrawn from there.
This could be a matter for discussion at the upcoming talks when our US colleagues are ready.
We very much hope that statements on their interest in these talks are not just empty words.
Apart from this, the EU and NATO member states are making statements, and even somewhat annoyingly, saying that the US is increasingly speaking and doing things that prove Washington is not going to provide assistance to Europe in case anything happens.
It is unclear what they mean but Russia is definitely not going to do any of the things we are accused of.
Yet, with the US sending additional troops to the European territory and boosting NATO's presence in the eastern flank close to the Russian border, with efforts to increase the scope and quality of military drills, the Europeans still feel that the Americans isolate themselves from them and avoid taking too much responsibility for Europe's security.
As soon as the physical and personal self-isolation is over, other countries will probably have an increasing trend for self-reliance and standing on their own.
Just look how the dialogue is proceeding between Hungary and the EU leading institutions.
A number of other countries have also adopted laws that allow national governments to respond to crisis situations without looking back at EU central structures.
The discussion regarding an optimal balance of the authority delegated at the supranational level and a country's own authority is still ahead.
We have repeatedly said - and this is our honest and sincere stance - that we are interested in a strong and united European Union, which will avoid living with past phobias and new imagined fears but which will be committed to fundamental agreements between Russia and the EU.
The agreement on strategic partnership and cooperation between Russia and the EU is still in effect.
Our European colleagues are not observing it at the moment as they have blocked all communication channels that were built under this document, and chose to act as if they were offended by the fact that we did not support the anti-constitutional coup in Ukraine, while they supported it.
This was the main reason behind it.
This is why we will see a dialectic development of events, with possibly stronger trends for self-isolation and self-reliance in many countries.
At the same time, many will become increasingly aware that relying on their own resources is insufficient for tackling trans-border and transnational threats, as we have mentioned.
Efforts should be made to seek a balance between strong nations - and it is these nations which are more successful in fighting the coronavirus in the current conditions - and serious, long-term and substantial international obligations that imply collective work.

Specific boundaries and configurations of the post-coronavirus world will be obvious to us later.
Question: In early April, Russia sent assistance to the US to help it fight the spread of the coronavirus.
The personal contacts between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have become more frequent.
The US President also mentioned their readiness to send aid to Russia, if it should be required.
In addition to this, Russia and the US are working together to stabilise the oil market by agreeing on the development of joint measures.
Can we now speak about the possible normalisation of Russia-US relations against the backdrop of the pandemic?
Sergey Lavrov: Relations between the presidents have always been normal.
They have been completely normal.
Both telephone conversations and personal contacts between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Hamburg on the sidelines of the G20 summit, and then in Helsinki and at another G20 summit in Asia, they have always been mutually respectful and aimed at continuous cooperation.
These contacts have developed such agreements as the creation of the Business Council consisting of the heads of the largest Russian and American private companies, and the creation of the expert council, where current politicians and political scientists could brainstorm to deal with the issues of strategic stability, global security and develop recommendations for the leadership of the two countries in this regard in all aspects.

These contacts also recreated interaction on the most pressing issue of cybersecurity, so that any fears and concerns that someone could use the cyber space to interfere in the domestic affairs of the other country were professionally and substantially reviewed by experts.
At the same level, during recent talks the readiness was confirmed and the need expressed to promptly reestablish complex dialogue on strategic stability in direct relation to strategic offensive weapons, given that the New START treaty expires in less than a year and that new kinds of weapons are appearing.

We are ready to discuss them outside the New START.
All this was agreed upon at the level of presidents.
Unfortunately, almost nothing has been implemented yet; another round of strategic stability dialogue took place this January, but we have not seen any desire to begin searching for constructive solutions from the American delegation yet.
I mentioned Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump’s statement on the 75th anniversary of the Meeting on the Elbe made yesterday.
It takes less than one page and commemorates those who fought and then shook each other’s hands on the Elbe.
It commemorates those who, while working on the homefront, provided the front with the necessary weapons and did everything to win.
It also contains a crucial political message that then, the USSR and the US could rise above their discrepancies and unite to win the decisive battle against the common enemy.
The American press has attacked Donald Trump for that last phrase, accusing him of playing up to Vladimir Putin and trying to cover up the Russian President.
So they had such a reaction to an obvious fact that should be welcomed and that normal people would greet with enthusiasm.
I hope that today we will rise above these discrepancies too, and will not waste any time on counteracting fakes, but will deal with the real threats.
By the way, speaking of the WWII and the Great Patriotic War, in May 1943, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, the Communist International decided to self-dissolute.

Josef Stalin said later in an interview to the Western media that it was necessary to do this in order to eliminate all ideological obstacles on the way to unite the efforts of the great powers in counteracting Nazism.


It is one of the examples that came into my head.
It is quite illustrative and helps us understand the spirit of cooperation that prevailed during the years when we fought the common enemy.
I think to a large extent the contemporary threats require the same unity.
Question: Your colleague, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, recently had the following to say about the future: “My fear is that the world afterwards will be very much like the world before, only worse.

Sergey Lavrov: I think the pandemic will certainly affect cooperation between the main international players.
I hope the crisis will improve relations between the leading countries.
I didn’t see this remark by Jean-Yves Le Drian, but I’m aware that he has been giving a lot of interviews lately, including about the new concept of multilateralism.

Some are saying the world after the pandemic will be a worse place to live in than it is now.
We can already see some of these predictions come true.
I’m talking about the relationship between the supranational and the national, and the temptation to shut oneself off from the world.
This is an illusion; it can’t be done.
Everyone understands this.
But some politicians will definitely come up with such proposals in the run-up for elections in some countries.
Nevertheless, I believe we should rely on basic principles that no one questions, such as the UN Charter, sovereign equality of states, respect for territorial integrity, political independence, non-interference in domestic affairs, peaceful settlement of disputes and much more that was included in the Charter by the founding fathers of the UN.
It was signed by 193 countries.
It represents a unique legitimacy and a unique organisation in terms of its mandate and agenda ranging from peace and security to environmental protection, food, non-proliferation and much more.
If the pessimism that you mentioned and the prediction of poor interaction in the international system are coming from a country with a strong spirit, such as France, this is probably not very good news.
I mentioned that France and Germany have been promoting the concept of multilateralism for the second straight year now. They have advocated creating an alliance of its supporters.
I asked questions, but have so far received no answer as to why Paris and Berlin, as well as those who have joined them on this path, believe that multilateralism lies elsewhere than the UN? Perhaps, for the purposes of clarity it then makes more sense to talk about comprehensiveness and to state clearly that all the countries should join the effort.
Perhaps, some will be more active, some less.
By definition, larger countries have more clout.
Smaller countries traditionally follow larger states’ opinions, but this does not change the essence of the matter.
You can be a leader, but you cannot leave anyone out.
Even more so, this cannot be done for ideological reasons.
If the European Union represented by France and Germany is responsibly declaring that multilateralism is the domain of the EU, and the EU is an example of multilateral behaviour and multilateral responsibility, then should everyone be looking up to Brussels? This is a little arrogant and not very polite, because the UN is the embodiment of genuine multilateralism.
The General Assembly is guided by the principle of democracy where one country is represented by one vote.
The Security Council sticks to the principle of nuclear powers’ special responsibility, hence, their obligation in the form of a veto.
The UN Charter is balanced and combines the need to reflect the roles of large countries and to give all counties their fair share of respect.
To reiterate, the General Assembly operates on the basis of one country - one vote principle.
So, building all sorts of alliances outside the framework of this unique and absolutely legitimate multilateral organisation invariably raises questions.
We can see the attempts to take the topics that are uncomfortable for our Western colleagues outside the UN and resolve them in a restricted group, and then present their decisions as collective decisions. We can see this behaviour in the sphere of the proliferation of chemical weapons, the dissemination of information, the protection of cyberspace and a number of other areas.
I hope we will do our best to explain the harmful nature of the scenarios based on any construct other than the UN Charter.
Question: Good afternoon, Mr Lavrov.
If I may, before asking my question, I would like on behalf of the students to express my gratitude to the MGIMO authorities for taking all the necessary measures at such a difficult and, what is more important, hardly predictable time, for distance learning. They listen to the students during such distance learning, and everything has been done to make such remote learning convenient yet still effective.
Here is my question.
It is about the prospects of formalising cooperation between the EU and the EAEU.
It is known that such attempts were made on many occasions in 2016 and later on.
It is also known that contacts are being maintained at the level of two commissions: the European and the Eurasian economic commissions.
Successful cooperation continues at the level of the EEC and some EU member countries.
Can you see any real progress in formalising the relations between the two integration associations and are there any signs of any change in their position regarding this matter under the new EU leadership? Indeed, new leaders were elected at the European Parliament as well as the European Commission last year.
Sergey Lavrov: So far there is no special progress in addition to what you have already mentioned.
The contacts between the two commissions were established, moreover on the initiative of the Eurasian Economic Commission.
The relevant proposal was dispatched a fairly long time ago – five years.
We did not get an answer for a long time.
Then there was a response on the issues that could not remain unresolved and that could not be left unregulated. 
I mean technical regulation, phytosanitary standards.It was what had to be agreed upon to conduct trade in a normal manner and, both in our case and in case of the European Union those issues were delegated to the supranational level.

Our European colleagues took a purely utilitarian approach.
But we think that it was also beneficial.
At least it was a recognition of the realities.
It was a recognition that to continue trade – and everybody wants to trade – it was necessary to contact the organisations that were established by five countries in the post-Soviet area and that keep on developing.
No doubt, we would like to get what you have just mentioned, namely signing an agreement creating a political framework and thereby making trade and economic contacts more convenient and comfortable as well as the solution of some other matters related to the existence of a common market in the EU and the establishment of a common market in the EAEU.
So far the main obstacle is the political bias and stubborn adherence to the infamously known “five principles” formulated way back by Federica Mogherini when she was High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy actually making further development, improvement and normalisation of relations between Russia and the EU dependent on implementing the Minsk agreements on the Ukrainian crisis.

The trouble is that the Minsk agreements are to be implemented by Ukraine in direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk.
The position chosen by the European Union is wicked.
They simply sent then to President Poroshenko and now to President Zelensky a very clear signal: do not do anything of what you should do under the Minsk agreements and the sanctions against Russia will be in place forever.

If these “five principles” were translated into the language of normal people, it will be just what Brussels told Kiev.
This message remains intact. 
Although the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and former Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell declared many times his intention to begin a revision of the EU policy with respect to Russia, we have not seen anything yet.

However, we are always open for dialogue with any EU bodies.
We used to hold summits twice a year.
The Permanent Partnership Council at the level of High Representative and Russia’s Foreign Minister met yearly, and its participants reviewed the progress of all the joint projects, without exception, including the implementation of over 20 Sectoral Dialogues between Russia and the EU.
All of that was frozen, though, and reduced to simply sporadic discussions related to international matters even prior to the unconstitutional coup in Ukraine committed in spite of the EU guarantees regarding the need to reach a compromise between the opposition and the then government.

All of that was trampled upon.
The EU guarantees were ignored, and the putschists in Kiev didn’t pay any attention to them.
You are well aware of the state of relations between us since that moment in time.
To reiterate, we do not have any hurt feelings that we would base our relations with the EU on.
Many EU countries are interested in expanding bilateral relations with Russia.
Of course, we accommodate them.
We have a simple answer for the conspiracy theorists in Brussels and elsewhere who accuse these countries and Russia of destroying European solidarity and the EU itself by promoting bilateral contacts with individual EU members. Our answer is fairly straightforward: how can we make you communicate with us if you are not willing to comply with the existing Strategic Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
But there are countries which, in full compliance with the powers reserved for them by the EU at the national level, are expanding cooperation with Russia, and are doing so rather successfully.
This is an attempt to accuse us of breaking something up or driving in wedges. This is not an appropriate thing to do. 
On the contrary! It was like the same situation when we were accused of turning away from Europe and looking to the East.
First of all, we are not in a position where we can afford not to look to the East, or to the West, for that matter.

Our geopolitical position dictates this.
Failure to derive comparative advantages from this situation would be simply stupid and inefficient.
We are promoting our relations with the West and the East with the same level of commitment to cooperation and partnership.
Many joint projects are falling through when the West imposes sanctions on us thus proving its status of an unreliable partner, or when, due to resentment caused by our rejection of the coup in Ukraine (which the Western countries swallowed, and some of them even orchestrated), illegitimate restrictions are imposed on us.
And then the West wants us to scale down our relations with the East. It’s just naive.
We have realised that we do not want to depend on the partners who have contributed to developing a number of our industries, but turned out to be unreliable partners, including in the EU.
Hence, import substitutions.
Accusing us of making a pivot to the East at a time when the West imposed sanctions, and we began to objectively expand our cooperation with China, India and other Asia-Pacific countries in relative terms, is also disingenuous.
Again, our position is not dictated by any hurt feelings.
Speaking at the Russia-ASEAN Summit in Sochi in May 2016, President Putin put forward an initiative to form a Greater Eurasian Partnership with the participation of the EAEU, the SCO, ASEAN and other states of our common vast Eurasian continent, including, of course, the EU countries.

We have never sought to create something that is off-limits to other countries that are interested in joining us and share the statutory principles of a particular organisation.
Let me assure you, the Greater Eurasian Partnership, which covers what I mentioned above and perfectly correlates with China’s One Belt, One Road initiative, will increasingly determine the future of our continent.
So far, the EU has been anywhere from neutral to negative (saying “moderate” means not saying anything at all) with regard to these concepts and demonstrated suspicion, which we, unfortunately, observe our European colleagues do with regard to many other issues.
But Great Britain left the EU.
They are now facing major difficulties in negotiating an agreement between Brussels and London.
It appears that a new agreement between the United States and the EU will be the next thing.

Knowing the Trump Administration, these talks will be difficult.
Not seeing the advantages provided by our common continent and not using them in these circumstances means depriving oneself, I mean the EU, of extra chances for competing in this highly competitive world.
I can talk at length about this, but my point was to identify the main trends.
All this will need to be discussed in detail.
I am convinced these discussions should begin soon.
Question: After the collapse of the prices of energy commodities because of the abortive attempt to extend the OPEC deal and some other factors, major oil producing countries, including the United States, were convinced of the necessity to set up a more comprehensive arrangement, along the lines of OPEC++.
How realistic is this scenario? Are you considering the prospect of expanding the GECF format within the gas production industry, when there is also the possibility of an overproduction crisis?
Sergey Lavrov: I would not say that the United States was certain that there was a need to establish a new organisation.
They are strongly bound by antitrust laws.
When they discussed, with Russia, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members, the sharp drop in the demand for oil and as a result, the unprecedented fall in prices, in every possible sense, they took account of the need to honour the anti-monopoly standards.
Strictly speaking, the United States will not be able to join any organisation or set up any organisation dealing with the oil, gas or any other commodity markets, because of its domestic legislation.
It’s another matter that they are actually working towards the same goal as OPEC, proceeding from the market situation.
If the market is oversupplied, then limiting production is a normal market decision. 
In some form, perhaps, the exchange of information (not coordination, let alone a cartel agreement) is on its own a serious enough, new and reasonable step.
I think the exchange of information, the ability to hear each other and take this into account when making decisions (whether in OPEC plus or in making decisions for reasons of market conditions) - this process of mutual informing will continue.
As yet, we have not received any report indicating that the Gas Exporting Countries Forum is considering holding its next meeting or an extraordinary meeting.
However, its member countries are in contact with one other via the leadership of its Secretariat.
An exchange of information of this sort is underway.
For understandable reasons I will not go into details, but I think that everybody understands that no one is interested in the collapse of this market.
Question: I would like to ask a question about the intra-Libyan conflict.
Despite the fact that the fight against the coronavirus is now the most discussed issue and tops the agenda of both separate states and various international organisations, the clashes between Khalifa Haftar’s troops and the Government of National Accord, led by Fayez al-Sarraj, are still going on.

And taking into account that even with active mediation by various countries, first of all, Italy, France, Russia, Germany and Turkey, the parties to the conflict were unable to reach a consensus, the question arises: are there any prospects for settling this conflict in the near future? Or could it turn into a lingering problem, the search for a solution to which will torment yet another country of this long-suffering region?

Sergey Lavrov: You absolutely correctly named the countries that came up with initiatives to assist at least the launch of negotiations to settle the Libyan crisis.
Also, you were absolutely right about the need for the main protagonists of the conflicting parties to reach a consensus.
They are represented by the head of the Presidential Council and the Government of National Accord Fayez al-Sarraj and General Khalifa Haftar, who commands the Libyan National Army and is supported by the Parliament, which operates in Tobruk in the east of the country.
In 2015, the Skhirat agreement was signed, but it remained on paper for a long time.

France, Italy and the UAE made attempts to revive the direct dialogue and make the two protagonists return to the negotiations table.
Always, when relevant conferences convened in Paris, Palermo, Abu Dhabi, the recent one in Berlin, at all stages, including the stage of announcing these initiatives and preparing them, we urged the participants to proceed from the most important thing: the parties themselves must develop solutions, and our role is to help them.

Our main objective is to bring them to the negotiating table and make them reach agreement.
Unfortunately, in most cases, such as the International Conference on Libya in Berlin, nobody was going to invite Fayez al-Sarraj or Khalifa Haftar.
We insisted that the organisers took our recommendation into account, and so they did, eventually.
So they came; they were in rooms next to each other, but it was possible to talk to them via the conference chair, German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
But our call to not accept and approve the Berlin documents without the express consent of Fayez al-Sarraj and Khalifa Haftar was not heeded.
Therefore, it all ended with the adoption of another nicely worded document that calls for very good things and even outlines concrete steps, but it was not agreed upon by the parties.
Another document, probably not stillborn, but definitely not healthy.
Now it is very important to return to the logic we called for, the logic of developing approaches that will be agreed upon by the conflicting parties themselves.
This is the responsibility of, first of all, the UN Secretary-General special representative.
Unfortunately, Ghassan Salame, who was in charge of this complex dossier until recently, resigned after the failure of the Berlin conference.
His deputy, American Stephanie Williams, is currently the acting UN envoy to Libya.
We believe that it is necessary to find a replacement for Ghassan Salame as soon as possible, and this should be a representative of a country of the region from the African Union, of which Libya is a member.
We will try to search for a settlement of this deep crisis that hit the country after NATO blatantly violated the UN Security Council resolution and bombed Libya in 2011, thus, in fact, breaking the Libyan state to serve their self-centered, mercenary objective of changing the regime of Muammar Gaddafi.
Since then, Libya has been left behind. This country serves as a road to the south for terrorists, weapons, drug trafficking and other nasty things, and illegal migrants cross the country going north, to Europe.
We are all now facing the consequences of the reckless scheme that NATO launched in 2011 in violation of the UN Security Council resolution.
Nevertheless, we will keep trying. Libya needs assistance.
Question: MGIMO University has opened a new programme – World Agrarian Markets - to train agricultural attaches.
It unites agriculture and diplomacy.

The republican form of rule exists in the majority of independent African countries that inherited it from colonial powers.

The elite educated in Europe were familiar with this system.
However, the real influence of governments and parties is not strong.
Not infrequently, even civilian governments are controlled by the military that often take the power in their own hands under the pretext of the need for stabilisation.
Who is one is supposed to hold talks with in these countries in this situation?
Sergey Lavrov: You want to get gratuitous advice that costs a lot.
In reality, there is no universal answer.
Talks must be conducted with those that have the relevant authority and opportunities to sell different kinds of goods.
Generally speaking, every country has its own structures and personalities that are involved in foreign trade and economic development.
Agriculture in Africa has an interesting geopolitical aspect.
Probably, the number of those who want to escape the burdens of war is smaller than the number of economic migrants who wish to improve their living standards and arrive in Europe with mobile telephones and bank cards.
These are not the refugees that we are used to perceive as victims of conflicts.
During all these past years European countries have discussed, accepted or rejected different ideas that are being voiced on the influx of illegal migrants.
They are even considering coercive measures when it is offered to compel all EU members to accept a certain quota but then they start discussing how to determine this quota.
Some countries are saying that they do not want any migrants, they want to live as they used to and preserve their national traditions and their cultural code.
As far as I remember, during these discussions on how to reduce the influx of migrants nobody has offered to introduce zero duties on African agricultural imports to the EU.
If you are involved in the economy, you understand that this will restrain the flows of migrants looking for a better life and better employment conditions.
If agricultural goods from Africa arrive in the EU duty-free, their employment in the countries concerned will increase. They will improve their living standards and will be less tempted to “seek happiness” abroad.
However, the EU countries are not doing this because a policy of agricultural subsidies for their industries is a “sacred cow” and nobody is going to change it.
This is a very interesting point and it is not just commercial but also geopolitical and systemic.
Question: Last week, it was announced that the Normandy Four foreign ministers were preparing for a meeting via videoconference.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he hopes for an opportunity to give new impetus to fulfilling the agreements reached in Paris in December 2019.
What are Russia’s expectations for the upcoming meeting? What would be a way to fast-track resolution of the conflict? Is the pandemic affecting progress?

Sergey Lavrov: Right now, we are exchanging suggestions on the agenda for this videoconference.
Unfortunately, Mr Maas’s hopes to give impetus to the decisions of the Normandy Four summit in Paris on December 9, 2019, are not reflected in the agenda proposals Germany has submitted for this ministerial meeting.
These proposals are entirely focused on another exchange of detainees, mine-clearing and ensuring the security of and access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) to the territory of the self-proclaimed republics, DPR and LPR.
The proposals do not contain a single word about the agreements concerning political reform or the Steinmeier Formula that links granting Donbass a special status to holding elections.
They do not contain a single word about the fact that Donbass’s special status must be incorporated into Ukrainian legislation on a permanent basis. And these things basically summarise the decision of the Normandy Four summit in Paris, almost word for word.
The decision which, according to the Normandy format leaders, would have to be implemented literally within the next few weeks, as the deadline has already passed.
All the parties presumed that if the Paris decisions were fulfilled, including the political reform that I mentioned, the next summit would take place in Berlin in April, or around this time.
But the next summit is out of question because everything that was achieved in Paris is being blocked by the Contact Group and the Ukrainian parliament and government thanks to Kiev’s position.
Head of the Ukrainian President’s Office Andrey Yermak, in contact with Deputy Chief of Staff of the Russian Presidential Executive Office Dmitry Kozak, attempted to get matters off the ground in terms of the key political agreements and to calm people down on both sides of the contact line.
His attempts have been derailed and Andrey Yermak himself has been accused of treason for daring to discuss the actual implementation of the Minsk Agreements that were signed by then President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko and which were approved by the UN Security Council. It is sad to watch.
Right now, our German and French colleagues want to discuss only those issues that concern security, demining, shelling and the SMM’s access to the territories outside of Kiev’s control, and they decidedly refuse to discuss political reforms where the actual problems lie.
As for security issues, the easiest way to ensure a ceasefire was rejected by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky at the same Paris summit last December.
Before the meeting in Paris, an agreement was pre-approved (and put down in writing) that reflected both the political aspects and security issues. As the core agreement, the Normandy format heads of state agreed to take actual steps within the framework of the Contact Group to withdraw forces and arms along the entire contact line.
If there is no contact there is no ceasefire violation.


Vladimir Zelensky expressly refused to sign the withdrawal of forces and arms along the entire line.

He proposed selecting three or so points where the withdrawal could be discussed.
They are still discussing it. Since December 9, 2019 through now, they still have been unable to agree on a single area to withdraw personnel and arms.

Our Ukrainian colleagues’ whims can be blamed for this.
The same is observed in deminig.
And I mentioned the deadlocked political issues.
There have been statements saying that the Contact Group is no longer necessary.
There have been attempts to portray Russia as a party to this conflict and to completely remove the representatives of Donetsk and Lugansk from the talks.
Alexey Reznikov, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister and minister for the so-called “temporarily occupied territories,” declared that the Contact Group consists of three members: Ukraine as the “victim,” Russia as the “aggressor” and the OSCE as “mediator” while Donetsk and Lugansk are either observers or not represented at all.
For us the Contact Group does consist of three parties: Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk.
This is based on the Minsk Agreements.
The overwhelming majority of the issues agreed upon in the Minsk documents have to be addressed through a direct dialogue between Kiev on one side and Donetsk and Lugansk on the other.
So, the Contact Group has three members, Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk.
Russia and the OSCE are acting as mediators who are helping them negotiate and who, on a larger scale, are supposed to be encouraging Kiev to deliver on its obligations.
So, frankly, I am not expecting any breakthrough from this meeting, unfortunately.
There is still a major battle ahead to force Kiev, Berlin and Paris to talk about how the political clauses of the French summit decisions are being implemented – or rather, why they are not.
Question: Emergency services have been under more pressure with the spread of the coronavirus.
This includes the Crisis Management Centre (Department) that helps Russian citizens abroad.
Do you need more volunteers, for example in the call centre or technical support on consular issues? If you do need more people where can they apply as volunteers?
Sergey Lavrov: From my position I cannot say whether the centre needs help.
They have contact numbers, so ask them.

I assume security issues could arise in this case, that is, access to information, but it is possible that there are certain levels of work that the centre could consider assigning to volunteers.
The centre and the Foreign Ministry’s Consular Department have contact numbers.
Contact them, and I will ask them to consider this opportunity, if there is a need.
Question: There are many well-known historical quotes that are ascribed to Russian tsars to the effect that Russia has few or no friends or allies.
Alexander III said Montenegrin Prince Nikola was Russia’s only friend.
From a historical perspective, I would like to ask the following question: how did the two countries allow a cooling in bilateral relations and the development of a conflict linked with the return of Russian citizens home last March? What relations will the two countries have after the pandemic? 
Sergey Lavrov: I myself am very sorry, because I really love Montenegro.
It is very unfortunate that its current leader Milo Dukanovic, who has ruled that country for almost 20 years, has occupied an overtly Russophobic position, contrary to common sense and everything he has said about relations with the Russian Federation.
He had problems with justice in the West. Some European countries accused him of smuggling and some other transgressions.

I cannot rule out that this could be behind the sharp change in policy.
But if politicians are so vulnerable, it is easy to manipulate them. 
I say this with a very heavy heart.
I met with him several times and even remember how he read verses by Vladimir Vysotsky. There is a wonderful monument to him in Podgorica.
Vysotsky composed one of his best verses in one breath, and I think he did it with absolute sincerity as he opened his soul to the Montenegrin people.
The verse ended in the following quatrain:
“One birth is not enough for me, I wish I had two roots… It’s a pity Montenegro Has not become my second homeland.”




These words are inscribed on the monument.
When I meet with my Montenegrin friends, they always talk enthusiastically about our spiritual affinity, the closeness of our people.
When someone is betrayed, not just an individual but a nation that was always close, it is sad.
But I’m convinced that the feelings expressed by Vysotsky in his verse, which are shared by the overwhelming majority of Montenegrins, will eventually prevail and those who are serving time will eventually leave.
Question: As a professional athlete who has defended the nation’s honour in hockey more than once, I root for Russian sports.
As a sports diplomat I understand that today Russia’s sports integration into international sports associations must be achieved mostly through diplomatic means, so my question is very specific and important for us.
Is the Russian Foreign Ministry considering offering practical training for those in our programmes so that as future sports diplomats we can gain experience in developing a strategy for Russian sports in the world arena?
Sergey Lavrov: This issue has not been raised in our meetings with the Ministry of Sport, the Olympic Committee or in other sports federations, but the idea is a good one.
We will try to do this.
I think this would be very useful because what you said is correct: there is less sports and more diplomacy in sports diplomacy today, which is not very scrupulous at times. So, I think this is a good idea.
We will try to do this.
Question: Today, you said that a bipolar global structure would not meet the moment.
During your meeting with the students from the Tashkent MGIMO branch on January 16, you also said that the era of Western countries dominating the global stage is becoming a thing of the past, and new significant actors are entering the global arena.
In what way, do you think, has the coronavirus pandemic affected this process? How will the alignment of forces on the global stage change after the battle with the pandemic is over?
Sergey Lavrov: I think the answers to these questions are now being discussed by political analysts.
There are several lessons to be learned. 
I mentioned some of them.
If we talk about the West and the non-West, we can see that the success of measures to combat coronavirus is not a function of being or not being part of the “civilised Western world.”
The effectiveness of these measures depends, primarily, on how well the state machinery is organised. We know from practice that countries which, notwithstanding all their democratic traditions, try to maintain a strong top-down chain of command in government, are more effective in responding to unforeseen challenges when medicines, pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and other equipment must be made, purchased or distributed quickly. They are also more efficient in promptly alerting the population of the rules to be followed and, most importantly, enforce these rules.
This is not to say that the Western healthcare system is ineffective. Not at all.
The era of Western dominance in global affairs is vanishing not because it has become weak or for other reasons that depend only on it.
It’s just the objective laws of economic development and, ultimately, the globalisation that the West has been energetically spreading throughout the globe that ultimately brought to the leading positions the economies, which were previously lagging, but now have learned to take full advantage of globalisation.
Now, the issue is about bringing manufacturing back to Western countries, including the United States.It’s time to engage, as you said, in deglobalisation.
After all, everything has become so interconnected and interdependent that it is unrealistic to change anything.
They are also talking about denationalising and renationalising many industries that are essential to survival of the state.
Major discussions are coming.
As I said, I hope that MGIMO and the Diplomatic Academy (another research and education institution at our Ministry) will contribute to these discussions.
Preventing the attempts to take advantage of the current situation and to advance unfounded accusations is coming to the fore. This will step up the confrontation, raise rates and increase the threat of new conflicts, this time between great powers.
One of the goals of the summit of the five UN Security Council permanent members initiated by President Putin, is precisely to prevent such a turn of events, regardless of what this may be connected with - coronavirus, fierce competition for the title of Number One global economy, or something else.
Preserving peace and the UN Charter principles is coming to the fore.
To reiterate, the sovereign equality of states, free choice of their future, respect for the cultural and civilisational diversity of the modern world, the need to combine efforts and to rise above the things of secondary importance, which include almost all differences, and to put together our efforts to overcome global challenges, including challenges like coronavirus infection.
Question: As you said, now for the world community the fight against coronavirus infection is a truly common goal, nevertheless, certain political and economic contradictions remain between states.
Is it possible that certain aspects of cooperation between countries, for example, the decision of the Russian Federation to send its specialists to countries covered by the coronavirus, will be used to solve problems in other areas after the pandemic? If so, will this accelerate, in your opinion, the establishment of a system of international relations based on the principles of multipolarity?
Sergey Lavrov: We are not guided by this when we direct our help.
In the case of Italy, this was a direct request from Prime Minister J. Conte. And we had such an opportunity.

In the case of the United States, the issue was discussed by Presidents V.V. Putin and D. Trump.
Trump said he would welcome such an opportunity.
Then, during another telephone conversation last week, he noted that he was grateful and the United States would be ready, when they had such opportunities, to assist us.
Probably, all this will create a more favorable atmosphere in order to cooperate normally and not try to blame each other for all mortal sins.
But the goal, I emphasize once again, which faced the President of Russia V.V. Putin when deciding on the direction of our assistance, was exclusively humanitarian, intended to solve the problem of helping people.
Question: Against the backdrop of the pandemic, we are witnessing the fragmentation of the EU member states.
Their governments gave preference to national response measures, rather than measures taken at the pan-European level.
In a situation where former unity between EU members is no longer observed, how do you see the future of Russian-European relations? Can they become more constructive? With which European countries can Russia manage to build cooperative relations? If possible, then in which areas of interaction could such a relationship be the most productive?
Sergey Lavrov: We do not observe that all EU countries want to fight the coronavirus on their own. Not at all.
They still have heated discussions there on whether to create a corona fund.
Many are for doing this.
A number of countries believe that they should not pay for others.
When money is divided, serious contradictions always appear, and here we observe just that.
I will not name the countries with which we would prefer to develop relations.
First, we are already developing relationships with many of them.
All this is known. Secondly, by and large, we want to develop relations with everyone, so by listing I do not want to create a false impression about our plans.
The areas of cooperation are unlimited.
I gave an example: the agreement that is still in effect between Russia and the EU laid the foundations for dialogue in more than twenty sectoral areas. This covers almost all conceivable areas of interstate relations.
We are for cooperating on the basis of reciprocity, to be friends with everyone who is ready for this, on an equal basis, on the basis of mutual benefit and interests.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s answers to questions at Bolshaya Igra (Great Game) talk show on Channel One, Moscow, April 25, 2020
Marina Kim: You are watching the talk show "Great Game: Diplomacy During the Pandemic.
" Is there a place for international contacts in the world amid the global wave of self-isolation? How is foreign policy changing amidst the pandemic? Today we have a guest in our studio, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
Good afternoon!
Sergey Lavrov: Good afternoon.
Vyacheslav Nikonov: Mr Lavrov, today we are talking not just about the coronavirus but also remembering events that took place 75 years ago.
History seemed to 'compress' when in one day we saw many historical events.
On 25th April, 75 years ago the first constituent meeting of the United Nations was held after its prior coordination in Yalta.
On the same day, the historic meeting took place between the 1st Ukrainian Front troops led by Ivan Konev and the 12th US Army Group led by Omar Bradley on the Elbe River near Torgau in Germany.

That was the time when the creation of the United Nations was underway.
Today, on the one hand, nations are celebrating this event, with preparations underway for the summit of the organisation's founding members.
At the same time, a growing number of people are saying that the coronavirus pandemic is increasingly dividing humanity, with each state standing on its own and a current lack of efforts by the international community to tackle the pandemic.
How do you assess the situation as regards the activities of the international community?
Sergey Lavrov: This is a core issue for all the discussions unfolding in Russia and abroad, at the UN, and at centres for political science.
I believe that we so far lack the facts that would allow us to reach a general and comprehensive conclusion about what has taken place and what lessons should be learnt.
The only obvious thing is that the trends that have accumulated during the last couple of decades are becoming increasingly urgent and critical amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
Contradictions have become more apparent between leading nations.
Just look at what is occurring with the relations between the US and China.
The UK, Australia and a number of European countries have joined the USA in its active efforts to claim compensation, threatening to seize property and accounts to make Beijing pay for imputed 'mistakes' during the first months of the spread of the infection.
And look what is happening in the EU, where fierce debates are going on about who will bear responsibility and assume the decisive role.
These disagreements lead to the conclusion that we are observing a rapid strengthening of the role of nation states.
Wherever integration associations are present or lacking in the world, nation states assume the main role in ensuring their citizens' security.
This trend is not rock-solid as there is an urge towards collective efforts in the EU.
I should also note the attention paid to our common tasks of battling this threat within the EAEU.
Yet, the aspiration of nation states to fend for themselves still prevails.
This probably reflects not only the current problem of fighting the pandemic but also a certain weariness - which is totally obvious in the EU – arising from the tenacious and obtrusive behaviour by supra-national bureaucrats at all levels.
It is noteworthy that within the EAEU we have always tried to prevent this by seeking consensual and compromise approaches, yet we do not always succeed in this regard.

This is the first trend I would like to emphasise.
The second one is the impact on the global economy and the erosion of numerous economic links (just sheer physical disruption in many areas), a fall in GDP, and the shock for many national economies (if not for most of them) and for the global economy in general.
Of course we cannot but see that this is all occurring alongside increasing conflict and a credibility gap.
We are seeing more attempts to resort to unscrupulous competition, settle scores, and use a zero-sum game policy as well as a dog-eat-dog approach.
Yet, I believe that the harmfulness of such attempts is already becoming clear and apparent to all international players.
I would like to hope that everyone will ultimately become aware that such trans-border and trans-national threats can be tackled only through collective efforts.
The pandemic is spreading regardless of continents, climate, region’s temperature, a country's currency reserves or possession of its nuclear arms.
That is why Russia's policy, which we have long pursued and which implies the protection of the equality of all nations as well as the principles and goals of the UN Charter that documents regulations for respecting the sovereign rights of all nations and settling disputes through peaceful means, should be highly relevant in the present situation where overcoming current and future crises is simply impossible without mutual assistance and respect for what we call the cultural and civilisational diversity of the modern world, without respect for the right of nations to independently choose their future and join forces on this foundation, and not on a master and slave basis, not based on anyone dominating.
This may sound idealistic and romantic to some - yet I am confident this should become the basis of serious politics.
Vyacheslav Nikonov: Dimitri Simes, with his finger on the pulse of the crucial events in international and US politics, is joining us from Washington in strict self-isolation amidst the global pandemic.

Go ahead, please.
Dimitri Simes: Of course, I’m isolated from your studio in Moscow, but I hope we can still maintain a constructive conversation.
There’s not much isolation in Washington, D.C.
This morning, I was anticipating the news about whether the US House of Representatives allocated $480 billion to help small- and medium-sized businesses, but this information remains unavailable.

The House of Representatives was focused on a completely different kind of business as it tried to outline the parameters of investigation into new charges against President Trump, including misdemeanor and abuse of power.
It turns out this time he’s fighting the pandemic the wrong way.

There’s good news as well.
At the last minute, the House voted to allocate funds to support the US economy.
As you may be aware, from the point of view of medicine and the economy, the situation in the United States is fairly grave.
To date, 50,000 Americans have died, which is an important milestone.
Earlier this morning, the mayor of Washington said she completely disagrees with President Trump saying that he can see “light at the end of the tunnel.

I heard your definitions of what is happening around the world.
I'd like to disagree, but it's hard to do so.
We are living in a polarised world. If we want to confront the pandemic, we must come up with our own national measures, which is probably the only possible response.
Russia is taking restrictive measures not only against Western countries (and the West against Russia), but Russia and China are forced to take corresponding restrictions as well.
This is sad, but makes sense.
We witnessed the first reaction to the pandemic.
It was like the first week of war. When the pandemic attacked, none of us was really prepared for it.
So, people are confused, and the worst instincts often come to the fore.
In your conversations (albeit informal ones) with the leaders of the United States and the EU, do you see any signs of interest in changing the rules and trying to identify common solutions? Or does everything still look fairly gloomy?
Sergey Lavrov: If we take the pandemic as such and as the main subject of ongoing talks, there’s a serious and strong desire to establish international cooperation.
The examples abound.
Shortly after the pandemic broke out, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution expressing solidarity in fighting the coronavirus, and shortly after it adopted another one with specific goals to make sure that the achievements in developing antidotes for this scourge are made available to all countries.
I consider this an important principle.
Let’s not forget that the G20 (given the debate started by some of its members willing to find out who was to blame and whether it was necessary to point a finger at one or more countries, or the WHO) has made corresponding decisions.
We believe these decisions nonetheless show the interest of the leading states and, I think, all other countries of the world, in joining efforts.
You are absolutely correct. The quarantine to prevent people from traveling far and wide is quite justified and should be taken, first of all, at the national level.
Moreover, the borders between residential buildings and flats, streets and squares in each country are under control as are the borders between the countries.
I would not consider this a trend that would last long.
To reiterate, it has now become clear that the multilateral organisations’ capabilitiesas compared with the efficiency and decisiveness of national states are, of course, losing in this "competition.
" However, I don’t want this willingness to see our efforts combined to become a hot-button issue.
I can see signs of this politicisation in the attacks directed against the WHO, which, I believe, harbour the attempts to justify particular steps which were belated or inadequate.
I believe the WHO, which, under its Charter, must act as the leading and coordinating body in healthcare matters, is fully coping with its role.
Of course, nobody’s perfect, as a Some Like It Hot character famously said.
Let's keep in mind the fact that the WHO is an organisation the activities of which are defined and carried out by the states. 
Until recently, they didn’t have any complaints with regard to it.
If the issue is about the WHO Secretariat, I’ll spend a moment discussing criticism of the United States, which is the key contributor to the WHO budget, as well as the budgets of the vast majority of other UN agencies.

In this capacity, Washington is entitled to be represented at the secretariats, including that of the WHO, at a much higher level than the countries that make smaller contributions.
So, if we look at the relative numbers, the decision makers at the WHO Secretariat are mostly US citizens, including in top positions.
I doubt that the Americans have been working in complete isolation from their government all these years. 
Just like the citizens of any other country, they should act independently. However, not a single Secretariat employee, no matter what country he or she is a citizen of, has ever declined to contact the member countries’ delegations if they had any questions.
Instead of yelling “stop him” and looking for the guilty, I would rather concentrate on, first of all, the necessary measures to develop vaccines in parallel with taking precautions and enforcing self-isolation and quarantine.
Only then would I start thinking about ways to improve global contacts and interaction in healthcare.
Speaking through my friend, French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian, our French colleagues are already talking about creating some high-level council on human and animal health, which will be assisting the WHO. 

The WHO already has a fairly deeply rooted practice of interacting with researchers.
If this tip can be of any help, let's take a look at this proposal.
I wouldn’t want the initiatives now being advanced to reassure those who are coming up with ungrounded accusations against a highly respected international organisation.
Vyacheslav Nikonov: Mr Lavrov, Dimitri Simes has just said that you are having informal contacts with foreign partners, which sounds somewhat confusing to me.

Are any informal contacts possible at the moment on an international level when contacts during this period of time are maintained solely online and everyone is perfectly aware that they cannot be confidential? How can they be informal?
It is true that diplomacy is, to some extent, an exchange of confidential information.
But this is becoming simply impossible now. 
This is similar to holding talks and speaking through a loudspeaker in a square.
Even if there are some secure communication channels, you never know what is happening on the other side.
On the one hand, it is understood that the process is becoming easier, with more international contacts happening simultaneously.
We observe them increasing, including in the multilateral online format.
Obviously, you have more time to sleep enough at home now rather than on an aircraft.
This is an advantage for the Russian diplomacy as well.
On the other hand, it is impossible to talk eye to eye, which certainly has its effects.

What does online diplomacy mean for you?
Sergey Lavrov: Mr Nikonov, you have just mentioned virtually everything that characterises diplomatic contacts during their current period.
This certainly allows for a better understanding of opportunities provided by modern technologies as well as their convenience for instant communication in case you have to urgently transfer something to your partners or receive information from them.
You are absolutely right about it - and this is probably the reason they are called informal as they hardly can end up in some specific agreement, which would require more trust-based forms of communication, particularly, direct contacts between diplomats, including face-to-face meetings.
It is unlikely that we will discuss some important secrets even in real life, neither will we make any conspiracy plots.
But information that should be specified by partners is often not a subject to be made public.
To develop a proper policy on a wide scope if issues that would meet international legal norms, we sometimes have to discuss certain matters that should not be handled online.
Dimitri Simes: Mr Minister, I would like to ask you a non-diplomatic question.
What you described today, your impressions and your analysis of the international situation are probably what you have long felt and thought.
You and Russian President Vladimir Putin have repeatedly said that the role of sovereign states is underestimated.
I don’t think it was a surprise for you that there is a shortage of “goodwill” resources and opportunities for international cooperation in the world, including in critical situations.
I have never heard you praise the idea of ​​a liberal international order, which implies that democracies are somehow more perfect, more humane and have some special rights in the international arena.
You have said as much repeatedly, and we have seen much of this in recent weeks.
But has anything actually come as a surprise for you? Has anything maybe struck you and, perhaps, reconfirmed that things are not just bad, but even worse than you thought? Or maybe some new opportunities?
Sergey Lavrov: Thank you very much, Dimitri.
You are absolutely right.
I do not want to look entirely devoid of self-criticism, but now, by and large, we can see that those ideals and ideas that we had promoted before the outbreak of the coronavirus infection are becoming more relevant.
It is not that we ever criticised the principle of democracy.
You were right that the traditional system of liberal democracy, liberal ideology, and the neoliberal approaches that imply the absolutisation of everything that is individual interest or property, has indeed exhausted and outlived itself in a context where the interdependence and interconnectedness of the modern world have broken down borders, including for threats such as terrorism, drug trafficking, organised crime, and now also contagious diseases (infectious and non-communicable diseases have long been a concern of the WHO and for all of us).
We have pointed out that, if there is a need to combine efforts to address common threats, it is wrong to underestimate or downplay the role of sovereign states.
However, supranational bureaucratic platforms were making attempts to overrule sovereign states.
Those attempts (I mentioned this earlier) led to controversy within the EU a long time ago, long before the pandemic, and are now the subject of broad discussions, including a discussion initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron about the future, and what Europe is, and how will it further develop.
You must be familiar with the concept of concentric circles.
I agree with what you said.
Despite all the differences in democratic countries, even our American colleagues once tried to categorise states in terms of democracy: liberal democracies, less liberal democracies, authoritarian democracies and undemocratic authoritarian regimes, or something like that.
Still, democracy is a broad enough term that covers many state systems, including those that some political scientists prefer to term ‘authoritarian’ or having ‘signs’ of authoritarianism.
There was a time when Madeleine Albright, who I had a chance to work with at the UN and then as US Secretary of State, put forward an initiative to make an alliance of democratic states.
It still continues to be implemented in some form.
The United States then proposed its own criteria and in fact single-handedly recruited members to join this alliance picking those they saw as eligible candidates for membership.
That was actually an attempt to undermine the authority of multilateral universal organisations, primarily the UN-based system.
The UN is a body with unique legitimacy and almost universal membership.
Its Charter and principles fully retain their relevance.
This is something very relevant to mention on the day when specific negotiations began on its Charter and later signed in San Francisco.
In October 2020, we will mark the 75th anniversary of the fully functioning UN.
Now we are seeing another interesting trend that is linked with multilateral organisations.
Last year, France and Britain suggested creating an alliance of multilateralists in which they invited some participants to ensure a “rules-based world order.
We have not received a distinct answer.
However, judging by what we see, it is possible to reach some conclusions as regards those that are promoting a “rules-based multilateralism.
When France and Britain made this initiative, they announced that the key role in implementing it would be played by European institutions and that the European Union (EU) was the cornerstone of this multilateral system.
Some sectoral systems and alliances are already being based on this philosophy.
The Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace was adopted. 
Over 60 states are taking part in it.
This is being done against the backdrop of our persistent efforts to promote cyber security in a universal format rather than a narrow circle of supporters.
All UN members are taking part in developing measures for responsible conduct in cyberspace. France and Germany have every right to take part in this work.
Yet, a separate mechanism is being created on issues of trust and security in cyberspace.
A Call for Action to bolster the respect for international humanitarian law in which a little over 40 countries are taking part has also been launched.

But doesn’t international law rely on universal conventions in which all UN members take part? What’s the point of creating a parallel structure? A third example is the International Partnership on Information and Democracy powered by Reporters without Borders.
Now 30 states have been included in it at France’s initiative.
Does this imply that other states do not want to support freedom of information? Let me recall that in the early 1990s, the last year of the USSR, the OSCE began to adopt a number of documents demanding that each participating country ensure full access to information for its journalists and the entire population.
But at this point, Russia Today and Sputnik are not admitted into the Elysee Palace, are being fined in Britain and harassed in other countries.
In Estonia, Sputnik was just shut down under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Of course, we all want to have access to information and freedom of information but for some reason our Western colleagues want to do this in their narrow circle and do not want us to discuss the same principles in a universal format.
This is a serious problem.
There is a difference between a “rules-based order” and universal international legal instruments, and also an attempt to create quasi-structures beyond universal organisations such as the UN. Our partners do not want to compromise.
They want their approach to dominate and be perceived as multilateral and universal.

But this is just substitution of notions.
Vyacheslav Nikonov: But you must admit that previously these goals were achieved through conventional Euro-Atlantic organisations, such as NATO or the EU, but now they have gone beyond this format and, I believe, this is indicative of a crisis in what they call the liberal world order, which, in my opinion, was never liberal, since it was unipolar, or global, as it was geared to one camp or country, and was not an order per se, because it was a world of global chaos.
Now, pay attention to the following: the numbers show that the countries that were affected the most by the coronavirus, both in terms of the area covered and the number of fatalities, include the United States, Spain, Italy, France, Great Britain and Turkey, all NATO countries.
Many are now saying that this is a certain manifestation (that’s a trend right there) of a crisis, including of the liberal order.
However, there’s China and the East Asian countries that are waging a very successful war on the coronavirus. They are now saying there’s an even greater shift in the centre of gravity and power from the Euro-Atlantic to the Pacific and East Asia and the US-China confrontation.
These global shifts are clearly taking place because the pandemic is like an earthquake that is sweeping away so many rickety structures, including the ones associated with the liberal world order.
This global trend could lead to a major turnaround in the balance of power in the modern world, given that the economic fallout of the pandemic is most painfully felt in the West.
Sergey Lavrov: I completely agree.
Of course, I don’t want to gloat over the fact that the “teachers of democracy” are going through hard times.
On the contrary, we are on the side of those who are bearing the brunt of the coronavirus outburst. We are helping as much as we can, and on a reciprocal basis, too.
But in general, if we analyse the ability of the states to withstand this threat - yes, of course, the statistics are fairly convincing.
Also notable is the fact that among the countries whose democratic basis is not questioned by any of our Western friends, the most effective are the regimes and governments that are not among the pioneers or ideals of liberalism.
I am referring to Asian countries like South Korea, Japan and Singapore that are countries with a fairly strong state power vertical, although no one is talking about stripping them of the title of democracy.
With regard to the liberal order and it being consistent with the purported ideal of “everything for the people and for the sake of human rights,” long before current developments, we had the opportunity to see that liberal states and countries that profess liberal world order can act very illiberally when it comes to their vital mercenary interests.

Remember how these “liberals” bombed the former Yugoslavia, or later Iraq under an absolutely false pretext, for which Tony Blair had to apologise when he acknowledged that there was no such thing as weapons of mass destruction.
Of course, what happened to Libya, and what the United States is trying to do with Venezuela, are by no means liberal approaches aimed at promoting human well-being as a central criterion.
It is also sad that some neoliberal countries are now trying to take advantage of the pandemic and, when all that matters is saving lives, to provide patients with needed medicines and food, and to do other things that are called for by the sanitary requirements, they are still focused on geopolitics.

We are also well aware of the situation with Russia’s assistance to Italy, provided at its Prime Minister’s direct request.
Some Italian media are bending over backwards as they try to portray this almost as a “military invasion of the Alliance.” We know from a variety of sources about another telling case.
A number of European countries, EU and NATO members among them, wouldn’t mind following in Italy’s steps and asking us for certain types of help in areas, where we really enjoy strong comparative advantages. Their “senior comrades” just won’t let them do so.
Here is another example.
I didn’t believe this when I heard about it, but I saw the original copies of the documents in question.
A major European football club, one of the major European and world football clubs, contacted its friends in Russia, a non-governmental charity foundation which during the pandemic made arrangements for procuring and distributing equipment and medications necessary to fight the coronavirus.
This internationally renowned football club just sent a letter to this foundation asking to look into the possibility of providing some basic items. I think it even offered to buy them, but that’s beside the point.
When the club received a positive response from this Russian NGO, the club then suddenly sent another letter that explicitly stated, “We are sorry, but for some reasons beyond our understanding this deal will not go through, as we were not allowed to do so.”
When liberalism manifests itself in these kinds of things, it discredits itself even worse than any of its critics could ever hope to.
To reiterate, I hope that when we are over and done with this situation, these countries will learn their lessons and voters will come to these conclusions as well.
We need to think about it now.
We will need to come to a place where multipolarity is no longer a slogan, but is instead implemented and embodied in concrete deeds before our eyes. It is important to fill it with proper content.
It is already impossible to turn a blind eye to the fact that there are more major powers and major centres of global growth and influence than one, two or three.
We need to operate based on this understanding and be ready to face the fact that we will still need to strive to reach consensus and to work under those principles that are laid down in the UN Charter and that remain relevant.
This is what President Putin’s proposal which he advanced in January aims to achieve. The point is to convene a summit of the UN Security Council permanent members so that the leaders of the Big Five become more aware of and realise the special responsibility assigned to them by the UN Charter for maintaining international peace and security.
Of course, the summit participants (we are already discussing this with our colleagues) should focus on a broad-based approach to ensuring strategic stability and global security in all dimensions without exception.
I hope this summit will be held this year and benefit the entire international community.
Marina Kim: Will it be a face-to-face meeting of the leaders?
Sergey Lavrov: Yes, we are talking about a face-to-face meeting.
Now, in addition to this initiative, which was advanced without the coronavirus in mind, the possibility of a videoconference is being discussed so that the five leaders can state their approaches to the coronavirus in addition to what has already been said by the G20 and the UN General Assembly.
The President of France came up with this proposal, and we agreed with it, as did the other G5 members.
The date and the communiqué that we would like to release following this conversation are now being agreed upon.
However, this is separate from President Putin’s proposal, which does not concern a specific, albeit rather acute, problem such as the coronavirus, but is about the need to conduct a face-to-face discussion about how we will go about building relations in the modern world in the interests of all states without exception based on international law.
The role that the UN Charter entrusts to the permanent members of the UN Security Council, of course, requires them to show initiative and responsibility.
This is what President Putin’s initiative is all about.
Dimitri Simes: Minister, you mentioned the search for international consensus.
To some extent, the entire concept of the UN was based on the idea that such a consensus is actually possible.
But is it? I recently attended a meeting in Washington.
Under the terms of that meeting, I can’t say who hosted it, but it was an official at your level.
The meeting was serious enough.
I had the opportunity to ask that person when he mentioned that China and Russia are behaving sort of inappropriately in this situation, creating problems for the United States – I asked him what exactly Beijing is doing and what Moscow is doing that Washington is unhappy with.
Regarding China, he gave what I would describe as a rather coherent answer.

I am not saying that he would have convinced you, but it was clear what he meant.

As for Russia, very little was said – basically, concerns that it might again intervene in the US election, because “what else can you expect from Russia.
What is the United States’ main problem with Russia? I think I got a fairly honest answer.
The problem is not Ukraine, nor is it disagreements over Syria, not even any specific oil disputes or Venezuela.
I am not saying these problems are not serious or non-existent, but still, they are mostly irritants.
The main problem, and you have repeatedly talked about this in a slightly different context, is that Russia in recent years, after Vladimir Putin became President, decided to play an independent role in the international arena.
The Russian definition of an independent role meant that the country would not follow the lead of the US or EU in foreign policy, but would seek a new international order.
You actually mentioned something very similar today.
When you look at the situation before the First World War, there were as many specific disagreements as now.
But basically, it was competition for a place in the world and about who was going to set the terms of that world.
It was primarily a dispute between Germany and Great Britain.
So don’t you think that today we have similar fundamental disagreements that manifest themselves in different ways and in different places? 
Russia’s choice to be a major global player that would not have the rules dictated to it explains what is happening now.
I am not saying this should lead to a new world war.
We are in a completely different situation, a different world with different threats.
But doesn’t it seem to you that we need to forget for some time about global consensus and focus on asserting our sovereign interests and managing disagreements that we have no hope of eliminating altogether?
Sergey Lavrov: When you talk about Russia not wanting others to formulate the rules alone, well, indeed, it does not want the rules of the game to be made by just one or two players.
If this is a problem anyone has with Russia, then, in my opinion, it is high praise of our foreign policy.
If, as you said, the French, the Americans and British are dissatisfied because we want the rules to be based on consensus, then yes, this is exactly what we want.
Perhaps this is hardly achievable now, as you also acknowledge.
But by no means should this goal be taken off the agenda.
Otherwise, those who are now defining and formulating the rules will be reassured in their belief that they don’t have to listen to anyone else.
But this will not happen because it is no longer possible: they face strong opposition from those who have every opportunity to assert their rights to participate in shaping the global agenda.
You mentioned the main thing that irritates our Western partners.
This is not some specific crisis or a conflict in the world markets but an aspiration to pursue an independent policy that our Western colleagues discovered after Vladimir Putin became President of the Russian Federation.
Mr Putin said this himself many times.
He also recalled that the Soviet Union’s disappearance was perceived as the end of history.
It was decided that the new Russia and the geopolitical space around it, that is, new independent countries were in the pocket of the Western liberals that we have just mentioned.
Many Western political scientists including you, Dimitri, also said that Russia’s aspiration to be an equal – let me emphasise, an equal – part of the Western world was underestimated.

We appreciate your analysis very much.
But when all attempts to talk and deal amicably were interpreted as weakness, demand built up in our society for someone like Vladimir Putin.
He fully justified and continues to justify these expectations.
You mentioned that they are irritated by Russia's reluctance to follow in the wake of the US or the EU.
To carry on the metaphor, let me say that there are many more wakes, many more solid and powerful ships in the world oceans, which leave a very powerful trail.
Different countries want to follow in their wake.
But I would like to emphasise that we do not consider ideal a model consisting of many options because these ships may collide while sailing in different directions.
Those that follow in their wake may also collide.
Meanwhile, we want to harmonise interests. 
Yes, today these interests are expressed rather aggressively.
It is very difficult to find a common denominator.
This will be a very long process.
But that is precisely why we have said that the formation of a multipolar world is objectively occurring but will take time.
This will be an entire era in the history of the human race.
We will hardly be able to complete this process that basically has not yet begun.
It is necessary not just to think but also to insist and make specific proposals on how to make the world run better and how to be ready to elaborate new rules relying on the sovereign rights of states, respect for each other and non-interference in each other’s s affairs – the principles of the UN Charter.
I would like to be mistaken about this, but if our Western partners put their signatures under these principles of the UN Charter in the hopes of preserving the more than half a millennium of domination of Western norms and rules for organising society, they were not sincere.
I hope this is not the case and that the founding fathers believed in what they wrote and signed.
Now a few words about accusations.
I won’t even go through the arguments on Ukraine, Syria, Venezuela and oil. We have spoken about this many times.
If anyone has a specific question, I am willing to answer it.

I will just mention that there are no grounds for our partners to speak about Russian interference in their election.
From the very start, during the 2016 election campaign, the Obama administration began to accuse Russia of this, we proposed using three trusted Moscow-Washington closed channels to clear up problems that may lead to unintended incidents.

We sent our proposals to the Americans via these channels, told them about our apprehensions and asked them about their concerns.
There was no response at all.
When in 2017 and later we continued to be accused of interfering in the election (and we are still being accused of this now), we suggested faithfully releasing what we sent via closed channels, offering in vain to give a professional, serious response to any apprehensions.
We were told the US did not want to see it released.
Literally the other day I spoke again with US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo following fairly intensive telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the coronavirus, oil and the importance of launching a new, serious dialogue on all strategic stability issues.
Among other things, I reminded Mr Pompeo that we expect our American colleagues to put forward specific initiatives on when exactly we could resume. I also recalled that we put on the negotiating table one more proposal to resume the work of the bilateral group on cybersecurity, in the context of which we are ready to raise any questions and answer any concerns on a reciprocal basis.


I said straightaway that we expect a new wave of accusations of interference in the current election campaign and suggested creating a mechanism that will be authorised by the presidents to review any issues that cause alarm on either side.
These proposals are still on the table.
I hope that this proposal will be analysed by professionals rather than the political operators behind the growing pandemic of Russophobia.

Vyacheslav Nikonov: I think the American founding fathers were very sincere but most of them were slave owners.
The issue of Ukraine.
Yes, this issue is an irritant, but it will always be raised in Russia-US relations.
The ministerial meeting in the Normandy format next week has been announced.
How are the decisions of the Paris summit going? What will be emphasised first? I believe there are some very serious changes in Ukraine: Mr Saakashvili received a proposal to be appointed vice prime minister on reform.
The tragedy of Ukraine is that against the backdrop of the current Ukrainian team he really seems to be a great thinker despite all his failures and being a professional loser.
How has Ukraine’s position and diplomacy changed with the new government? Vladimir Zelensky has been president for a year now.
How has the style and content of Ukrainian diplomacy changed? Is it possible to come to terms with Kiev on anything?
Sergey Lavrov: We really planned a video conference of the Normandy format foreign ministers next week.
When the leaders of the four countries met in Paris last December they agreed that their foreign advisers and foreign ministers would monitor compliance with the agreements reached in Paris.
Of all the agreements only one was carried out on a modest scale: the exchange of detainees.
Fewer than 30 people were exchange by Kiev on the one side and Donetsk and Lugansk on the other side.
To our huge regret, none of the other agreements reached in Paris have been carried out and not through the fault or lack of goodwill of Donetsk and Lugansk.
What am I referring to? The main issue, of course, is the security of the people, the cessation of shelling and violence.
President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky has said more than once that for him the main goal is to save Ukrainian lives.
Now our colleagues from Germany, France, the US and the OSCE regualrly ask us to influence the home guards to achieve a reduction or cessation of ceasefire violations.
To do this reliably we simply need to ensure the disengagement of forces and weapons. We see the statistics on ceasefire violations presented by the OSCE.
These figures in no way confirm that these violations are made only by Donetsk and Lugansk while the Ukrainian military is just an innocent victim.
It is, in reality, the other way around.

But let me emphasise once again that to remove these threats, it is primarily necessary to disengage forces and weapons.
The consensus on doing this along the entire contact line was the first item in the draft document agreed upon by the foreign policy advisors and foreign ministers from the Normandy format countries at the Paris summit.

When this document was put on the negotiating table in Paris, President Zelensky said that as a responsible man, he could not sign a document on the disengagement of forces and weapons along the entire contact line.
Germany and France were perplexed by this statement but Zelensky was adamant.
The only thing he could agree on was to come to terms in the Contact Group framework on three additional sections on which forces and weapons would be disengaged.
An agreement on this was reached for want of anything better.
This was supposed to be done at least by the end of March but has still not been done because at each meeting of the Contact Group Ukraine plays tricks and makes new arguments to avoid coming to terms on the disengagement sections.
The same thing happens during the discussion of another item in the Paris agreements, in the Contact Group. It compels the sides to seriously deal with mine lifting and economic recovery.
However, we are seeing overt subversion of the political part of the Paris agreements where President Zelensky finally committed himself to include the Steinmeier formula in Ukrainian legislation and to start discussing all aspects of ensuring the political status of Donbass in it on a permanent basis.

Ukraine does not want to discuss any of these issues.
Moreover, the sides agreed that by the next summit it was necessary to fulfil everything that was agreed to in Paris and at the same time to come to terms on the future Berlin summit at which our German colleagues are eager to pay primary attention to discussing an election in Donbass.
We recently heard a statement by Vladimir Zelensky who said that there will be no election until some mythical “mercenaries” are pulled out of eastern Ukraine and the Ukrainian authorities establish control over the entire border with the Russian Federation. Only after this is done will it be possible to talk about an election.

A similar idea was expressed by Petr Poroshenko at one point. So, little has changed in this respect.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin has reacted several times to these attempts to turn everything that was written in the Minsk agreements upside down.
We have commented more than once on the desire to introduce UN occupational troops there.
I have to say with regret that for all of our conviction that President Vladimir Zelensky wants peace, as he said during his election campaign, we have not seen that he is being allowed to move towards the honest implementation of the February 2015 Minsk Package of Measures so far.
This is disappointing.
We will certainly talk about this at the virtual foreign minister meeting.
We are particularly concerned that people who are not competent enough begin to start implementing the Minsk agreements.
There is a deputy prime minister who is also the minister on the issues of “the temporarily occupied territories” who is beginning to make statements on Kiev’s approaches to a settlement in Donbass. He bluntly rejects the idea supported by the head of Zelensky’s Presidential Office, Andrey Yermak, at the talks with Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Dmitry Kozak.
I am referring to the idea of creating a consultative council from representatives of the civil societies in Kiev and Donbass. Their task would be to create the appropriate atmosphere for implementing the Minsk agreements with public representation from Russia, Germany and France.
Let me repeat that Mr Yermak added his signature to this but later the forces I mentioned, which do not want to allow the Ukrainian authorities to fulfil the Minsk agreements, balked and now all this is called into doubt.
So, the Ukrainian initiators are once again “backing away” from the Minsk agreements.
But Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Reznikov who is in charge of the so-called “occupied territories” said that the Minsk agreements are not an international legal document, that they are at best political agreements and must be treated accordingly.

In other words, they are not a “sacred cow” and are far from being the ultimate truth.
It would be good if those that are well versed in foreign policy explain that the Minsk agreements have been approved by the UN Security Council and have thus become international law.
Hence, they must be fulfilled as such. I can anticipate what will probably be an important conversation at the ministerial level because we have spoken about this with our German and French colleagues many times.
We asked them to persuade the Ukrainian authorities to conduct honest and constructive work but, to be honest I don’t expect any result from the video conference. I think our Ukrainian colleagues will again insist on meeting in Berlin as soon as possible.

It is important for them to demonstrate that they are meeting in the Normandy format and at the same time to pay less and less attention to the Contract Group where they can directly resolve issues with Donetsk and Lugansk.
They want to avoid this as much as possible and make the Normandy format the only channel of talks on the Minsk agreements. 
They believe that in this Normandy format Russia is an aggressor while France and Germany are helping Ukraine compel Russia to fulfil everything that Ukraine is supposed to fulfil via, let me emphasise this, a direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk.

This is a grave situation.
I will complete my replies with a single phrase.
We will never agree to a new summit unless the decisions made in Paris are conscientiously carried out in full. There is no other way to fulfil them than to act appropriately in the Contact Group and come to terms with Donetsk and Lugansk.
We will facilitate this in cooperation with the OSCE.
Marina Kim: Mr Lavrov, thank you very much for taking part in our programme, for your honest and open conversation, and for the detailed explanations on the current situation in global diplomacy, which is also affected by the pandemic.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s remarks and answers to questions at a roundtable discussion with the participants of the Gorchakov Public Diplomacy Fund in the videoconference format, Moscow, April 21, 2020
I am grateful to the Gorchakov Public Diplomacy Fund for inviting me to take part in the discussion that opens, as I understand it, a cycle of lectures the fund will hold online.
Life compels us to find creative ways to continue the discussion on the future of humankind.
They are highly relevant under the current conditions. The coronavirus pandemic has become a major challenge for all countries and many international organisations.
It should certainly compel us to ponder over what is happening in the world, and also to understand how we should live in the future and how we should advance to ensure peaceful, safe and stable future for all humankind.
It has long been clear, and the pandemic has confirmed it definitively, that we live in an interdependent and intertwined world.

In the age of the free movement of people, capital, services and goods in the whole world, threats also move freely. We have faced terrorism, drug trafficking, other forms of organised crime, the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and now the threat of the pandemic that knows no borders and from which it is impossible to fence ourselves off.

It is clear that under these conditions we must adopt collective approaches to international relations.
Concepts and practices of hegemony and domination are absolutely inappropriate in the 21st century. 
The world is confidently moving towards the formation of a new, more just and democratic system of international relations and a polycentric world order.
This is not happening artificially; it is a result of a natural upsurge of many economies and financial centres.
Economic and financial influence is naturally followed by influence in international politics.
We are seeing these processes primarily in the Asia-Pacific Region, Latin America and also in Africa, whose resources are linked by many with the future of humanity in a very long-term perspective.
The countries that are making strides in this way today and strengthening their national economies and financial opportunities also pursue an independent, nationally oriented foreign policy.
And I must admit that many achieve quite positive and impressive results in this area.
The attempts we are seeing to impede this process are certainly doomed historically.
Understandably, the countries that set the tune in international affairs for almost half a millennium want to preserve their privileged positions when they see their new competitors growing stronger.
They are using different instruments, some of which are not absolutely honourable.
Let me emphasise once again that the attempts to impede the objective process of the formation of a multipolar system are doomed historically.
The understanding of this is reflected in many cases, in part, in the formation and functioning of the G20, where the G7 and BRICS countries are represented.
Without their cooperation and consensus it is very difficult to resolve any serious problems in the global economy and finance, or in international politics, by and large. Other associations in which the Russian Federation takes part also work under the principle of consensus.
I would like to mention the SCO and other integration associations in the post-Soviet space – the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the CSTO and the CIS.
I work under the premise that the current coronavirus crisis is compelling us to consider more seriously and probably more quickly the decisions that many international actors have postponed for various reasons.
In particular, I mean the humanitarian aspects of human development.
Unlawful unilateral sanctions and sanctions that were taken without regard for the UN Charter are doing tremendous damage to the people in many countries. 
I am primarily referring to countries like Iran, Syria and North Korea.
Even now when these countries badly need equipment, medications and special protection gear to counter the pandemic, they cannot receive them because Western countries, primarily the US are categorically rejecting proposals to take a humanitarian pause and make an exception for goods that are essential for countering the pandemic.
This is regrettable.
An appeal to this affect has been forwarded by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet also made a similar appeal.
At the online G20 summit, President of Russia Vladimir Putin proposed green corridors that would be free of trade wars and sanctions so the countries in need could receive medications, food, equipment and technology.
Before going over to interactive communication, I would like to draw your attention to an important conceptual issue that we have paid much attention to recently.

I mean the trend of our Western partners to make fewer references to international law or even remove it from the international lexicon altogether.
Instead of the well-established term “international law” they are attempting to use a new expression, “a rules-based order.  We see how this concept is taking shape and being used by our Western partners in practice.
Their approach to issues goes beyond universal, multilateral institutions. They want to uphold their exclusive position on these issues and do not want to negotiate.
Note that when there is a problem in well-established and universally recognised mechanisms, on which the West is facing resistance, in many cases it stops seeking consensus and simply takes this problem beyond the framework of multilateral structures.
I am referring to what is happening in the OPCW with attempts to initiate votes to change consensus-based Convention documents and many other things.
We will certainly uphold UN-centric universal institutions and the entire system of international ties that have been formed based on the UN Charter.
The principles of the Charter, primarily, the sovereign equality of states, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and peaceful settlement of disputes maintain and even enhance their importance today.
We are celebrating the 75th anniversary of Victory in World War II and the 75th anniversary of the UN.
I think this is a good reason for all of us to unite and concentrate on consolidating universal mechanisms rather than on creating flawed alternative structures in order to replace multilateral diplomacy with different terms, such as “a rules-based order” or the newly coined expression, “the Alliance for Multilateralism.
Those who want to support multilateralism must recognise that the only and true multilateralism is embodied in the UN which has unique legitimacy. 
Therefore, supporters of multilateralism must come to the UN and come to terms with all other countries there, instead of negotiating within the narrow circle of soulmates and imposing their opinion on others as universal and the only correct approach. This is what worries us.
I am very grateful to have this opportunity to discuss these issues.
We are always trying to hear and consider the assessments made by Russian and foreign experts and political scientists.

Thank you very much for your attention.
I am ready for more work.
Question: A question on Libya.
Every unbiased person has long recognised that it is owing to the assistance of the Russian Federation that Syria’s legitimate government and the country have been saved.
There is another hotbed in the region apart from Syria, that is, Libya.
Do you think Russia could build a similar initiative on a specific and efficient settlement of the situation in Libya by creating an international coalition with Egypt, Italy and other countries of the region?
Sergey Lavrov: We are completely open to developing honest, well-balanced cooperation on any crisis issue, including the settlement of the conflict in Libya.
You know this conflict started when our Western colleagues – NATO countries – crudely violated a resolution of the UN Security Council.
The resolution was adopted in 2011 and provided for a no-fly zone over Libya. The resolution explained this provision: the air force of Colonel Gaddafi had no right to be in the air, and they did not fly. To secure the no fly zone, the UN Security Council authorised all interested countries to take the necessary measures to prevent Gaddafi’s air force from flying.


And in order to ensure the regime of a no-fly zone, all interested countries were authorized by the Security Council in order to take all necessary measures to prevent the Qadafi Air Force from flying.
Its aircraft did not fly. Meanwhile, the West flew NATO aircraft into the air, I believe crudely and brazenly, and started bombing Gaddafi’s army on the ground. In effect, the West acted on the side of the extremists (that were in the majority) and they decided to overthrow the Gaddafi regime.
After which Libya turned into a black hole.
Smuggled arms, militants and drugs streamed into black Africa, Africa to the south of the Sahara, the Sahara-Sahel region.
Many terrorist manifestations that have struck root in Africa are linked with this period. 
Many illegal migrants moved northward via Libya. Europe is still suffering from this immigration pattern and finds it difficult to resolve the problem.
What can be done now? I am saying this not to continuously return to the question of who is to blame. 
But the question of what must be done is more important at this point. Russia, our Italian colleagues and many other European states and countries in the region have reached a fairly good understanding.
We agree that this conflict does not have a military solution and that it is necessary to come to terms. Russia and many other countries, including Turkey, Egypt, the UAE and Qatar are working to launch a political dialogue. 
Let me recall that we actively supported the efforts of Ghassan Salame when he was UN special representative on a settlement in Libya.
We tried to promote a settlement by proposing our own initiatives when we supported the Berlin process and tried to facilitate the success of the Berlin conference. At that time, we and our Turkish colleagues organised a meeting in Moscow for Marshal Khalifa Haftar, Fayez Mustafa al-Sarraj, head of the Presidential Council and the National Unity Government and Aguila Saleh, parliament speaker in Tobruk.


Regrettably, at this meeting we did not sign any documents but at least we encouraged them to move towards compromise and consensus.
We played the decisive role in persuading our German colleagues not to ignore the Libyan sides in preparing the Berlin conference.
At first, they did not want to invite either Sarraj or Haftar, or any other Libyans and even their neighbours.
We worked hard to convince them that this would have been a mistake.
This is why the main protagonists – Sarraj and Haftar – attended the Berlin conference. As well as Libya’s neighbours, including our Egyptian colleagues.



To use a common phrase, our main message at the Berlin conference was that we were willing to support any solution if it was backed by Sarraj and Haftar.
Regrettably, we did not receive a straight answer to this question in Berlin. So, we supported the ideas that were formulated in Berlin, but with the reservation that they must not be imposed on the sides, that it was necessary to persuade the sides to accept them.

Unfortunately, we were right again because now the implementation of the decisions of the Berlin conference is stuck again and hostilities have resumed.
We have one simple initiative: let’s continue the political process once again.
Ghassan Salame played an active, if not the main role in the Berlin process, but he resigned as the UN Secretary-General’s special representative on Libya.
Now his duties are performed by Stephanie Williams from the US, who was his deputy.
I believe it is necessary to appoint a permanent representative on Libya as soon as possible. We are convinced that this representative must come from an African country that is located in the same region as Libya.
Now the European Union has decided to help monitor the observance of the embargo on arms supplies to Libya.
This is a noble cause but… we have discussed this issue with our European friends several times in the past few months. I spoke with Josep Borrell, Heiko Maas and Luigi Di Mayo.

I think the European Union must go to the Security Council and say, “The Security Council has announced an arms embargo and it must be fulfilled.
We, the EU, want to carry out one more special operation on monitoring compliance with this embargo. It consists of such and such parts.
We would like to ask the Security Council to support our approach.”

The fact that the EU is doing everything it can to avoid presenting its ideas to the UN Security Council makes us wonder about its motives.
I hope we will soon be informed as to what they are thinking.
To sum up my rather lengthy answer, I would like to emphasise again that we support the idea of creating a platform on which all external players can persuade the Libyan parties to come to terms.
We have seen attempts to bet on one side or the other in the past.
From the beginning of the UN’s efforts to reach a settlement on Libya, we have supported contact with literally all sides. All of them have come to Russia.
We have met with each of these political leaders at various multilateral venues. We are now happy to say that our partners who tried initially to take sides with one Libyan leader or another, now understand that it is much more productive to compel all of them to sit at the negotiating table and come to an understanding.
This is what I consider necessary for all of us to do on the Libyan crisis.
Question: As you noted, we have been observing a perfect storm on a global scale since the beginning of 2020.
How would you assess these trends’ impact on the EAEU countries in general and on Russia and Kazakhstan in particular? What must we do together?
Sergey Lavrov: I am confident that only together can the countries in the post-Soviet space get through this time with minimal losses.
It so happened that the crisis broke out when we were about to take – and I am sure that this will still happen – very important, new steps in the development of Eurasian integration, where we already have the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. In the next stages, we plan to lift the remaining barriers, including the establishment of a single energy market in a couple of years.

I believe that all these plans remain in effect, which was reaffirmed at the recent online summit of the EAEU member countries.
Online meetings between prime ministers and ministers of specific sectors are also in the pipeline.
I believe that we must strengthen joint multilateral institutions, such as the Eurasian Development Bank and the corresponding Eurasian Fund, which exist, operate and address a lot of issues that are very important for the member countries.

I don’t have anything surprising to say here.
Meticulous work to strengthen joint institutions.
And, of course, we must take into account the experience of other integration associations that were established much earlier than the EAEU, above all the EU.
Right now the European Union, like all of us, is going through difficult times, but this crisis coincided with the growing debate about the balance between the functioning of supranational institutions and the responsibilities of national governments.
This is a very important issue; we can see how actively Brussels and many capitals are discussing it, including regarding the rights the national governments should have and the rights that are or will be delegated to central, supranational institutions.
Of course, we also discuss this issue within the EAEU.
We should always learn something useful from a crisis, and the way these issues are solved in the EU will be very useful for us in finding ways to address similar tasks within the EAEU.
Question: As you may know, some people in Poland believe that bad relations between Russia and the EU is a good thing.
Do you think these relations, primarily economic, will normalise during the crisis following the pandemic? And if so, will the Polish government attempt to slow down this normalisation, or will Warsaw decide that the economy is more important than politics under the circumstances?
Sergey Lavrov: Thank you, this is a very interesting question.
You said there are people in Poland who believe it is a good thing that the relations between Russia and the EU are bad.
I can assure you that there are people in Russia who are happy that the relations between Poland and the EU are not so good either.
If we keep looking for things to gloat over, then instead of politics we will be engaged in politicking and trying to satisfy our own or someone else’s ambitions.
I remember the time when I became foreign minister.
Historically, we have always had very complicated relations with Poland but in that period we probably had more cooperation mechanisms with Poland than with any other European country.
We had the Committee for the Russian-Polish Cooperation Strategy headed by foreign ministers with the participation of deputy ministers of the economy, finance, trade and culture.
We had a group on difficult problems, where historians would get together to honestly discuss both regrettable and happy pages of the Polish and Russian peoples’ past.
Moreover, some remainder of those relations still remain.
Fairly recently, definitely after 2014, a Russian-Polish textbook came out on the history of the period of a century ago.
It is not much but it is something. The book had a number of joint articles.
Wherever opinions differed, two standpoints were presented – a Russian and a Polish one.
It is much better than accusing each other via microphones without a chance to communicate.
We used to have a joint award presented by the foreign ministers of Russia and Poland to cultural figures.
I remember that together with Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski we presented awards to Barbara Brylska and Viktor Yerofeyev.
It was in Warsaw.
The ceremony was very heart-warming.
There used to be a lot of useful things.
All that is now “frozen”, including visa-free travel between the Kaliningrad Region and the adjacent provinces of Poland.
I consider it to be a sad fact.
If we all support contacts between people and openness of societies (and I think the Polish leadership also advocates this), how can we shut down visa-free travel? They say it was largely related to commercial interests: some people bought cheaper things abroad and then sold them with a profit at home.
But the important thing is that there was communication between people.
Regarding ways for us to get out of this situation. The European Union – and we see and hear this as it is declared publicly – is approaching the moment when it will have to decide whether to review the “five principles” invented by Federica Mogherini for relations with Russia or to leave them intact.

I know that Poland stands for keeping them in place.
Many other countries also speak in favour of making no changes.
A number of other EU members believe that the situation should be considered realistically, basically proceeding from the interests of the EU nations and the EU economies.
We will be ready to speak with the European Union under any conditions.
In fact, we are doing it now.
But the “five principles” are being employed by some countries to block the resumption of sectoral dialogues, and we used to have over twenty of them: in energy, culture, human rights, transport, healthcare, finance, and so on.
We used to have two annual summit meetings.
We used to have the Permanent Partnership Council (it exists only on paper now) to review assessments of progress on agreements across the whole scope of our relations.
All that is now frozen.
We are being accused, including by Poland, that Russia is trying to undermine the EU authority and speaks with the capitals of member-countries – Rome, Paris, Budapest – rather than with Brussels.
It is not our malicious intent, it is just the circumstances as they are.
If Brussels froze all the channels while the capitals of the member countries advocate the development of bilateral relations, we will definitely respond.
I sincerely hope that we will also overcome the current period with our Polish neighbours and, I dare say, friends (I have many friends in Poland), and attempts to artificially create pretexts for dividing our nations will not prevail.
I assure you that you will see a very positive response from us to any proposals that are de-ideologised and are based on the present vital interest of the citizens of Poland and Russia.
Question: As you know, in the US, there has been a debate for several months about a possible withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty (OST).
It is believed that the United States may make an official statement in September.
In your opinion, is Russia ready to remain a party to the Treaty in the event the US pulls out? If so, under what conditions is this possible? Can the European partners of the Treaty influence this decision?
Sergey Lavrov: This issue is gaining relevance, given the timelines you mentioned.
Experts who monitor the developments believe that Washington has already taken a decision.
We believe that these assessments have a significant element of truth.
We draw almost the same conclusions based on our contacts with the Americans, other members of NATO and the OST.
Like in the case of the Intermediate-Range Missiles Treaty (INF Treaty) and the Open Skies Treaty, the Americans have already begun to actively (and have been doing so for a long time) advance the argument that Russia violates it.
Although they do not have any reliable facts either in this situation or in the case of the INF Treaty.
I will not go into details; if you follow this issue, then you know the compromises that have been reached regarding the main claim that the West presented to us.
I mean flights over Russian territory near the borders with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
We were ready to settle these claims with the understanding that Georgia would also open its skies for such flights.
Then we would have opened areas over the territory of the Russian Federation adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Such a compromise was reached, but then the Georgian side rejected it and said that it would not allow our inspectors to fly over its territory.
This is the only real claim that remains artificially.
It was possible a long time ago to agree on this, as we actually did.
But our colleagues did not keep their word.
By the way, the Americans use a similar trick regarding the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).
Although they officially stated that they would not ratify it, they nevertheless try to use its provisions to accuse us and, more recently, China of violating the CTBT.
What is their purpose? As I understand it, the same as in the case of the INF Treaty.
But as for the INF Treaty, it was necessary to justify the withdrawal from this Treaty, while in the case of the CTBT, it is necessary to justify why the Americans categorically and already officially stated that they would not join it.
The same thing with the Open Skies Treaty.
The current US administration conceptually and fundamentally objects to any kind of control over American military activity.
Especially when such control is exercised on or over the US territory.
Will other countries follow the Americans? I doubt it.
It seems to me that the Europeans understand that the OST has added value as an instrument of trust, predictability and transparency. 
We consider it as such.
Our reaction to Washington’s possible decisions will depend on the wording of this decision, on what it exactly means.
Of course, we will see whether any NATO allies will follow Washington, because the very added value that the Treaty now has will depend on it.
But we will just have to see how it remains in the light of US plans.
Question: As the events in recent years have shown, the people in Kyrgyzstan have demonstrated increasingly less support for the EAEU while being more critical, in particular, about the free movement of goods and capital.
Russia is providing assistance to our migrant workers but meanwhile, it is the poor performance of our national authorities that has become the subject of such criticism and given rise to scepticism among the population regarding the EAEU’s prospects.
Do you think it is time for Russia to adjust its policy in CIS countries, in particular, in Central Asia? 
Sergey Lavrov: What adjustments should be made?
Question: Stepping up the work with political groups and forces.
Sergey Lavrov: We are perfectly aware of the importance of our relations with our neighbours in Central Asia, South Caucasus and the European part of the CIS.
We see the increased activity by the United States, the EU, Japan, China and Turkey in these regions, including Central Asia.
There have been "5+1" formats, with five Central Asian countries and one being the USA, Japan or the EU.
The Russian Federation proposed this format, and our Central Asian friends actively supported it.

Two meetings have already taken place.
This format may seem irrelevant as we have the CIS, the EAEU, the SCO and the CSTO - but none of these organisations allows Russia to directly communicate with all five Central Asian countries.
I think that such a "5+1" informal association (Central Asia plus Russia) will be useful.
We have already held two meetings of foreign ministers in this format.
As regards the EAEU meeting the expectations of its member states, you know that the organisation is receiving a lot of criticism; much of it comes from our Belarusian neighbours.

The EAEU is a rather young association; it is much younger than the EU.
We are slowly proceeding towards developing common markets, including energy markets, and this is going to be a crucial, gradual and qualitative stage in our relations.
You should just take an objective look at the existing advantages and try not to take this for granted.
Migrant workers were active prior to the establishment of the EAEU, and nothing bad happened.
There were occasional problems, with an amnesty announced for migrant workers; this has taken place many times, including recently.
What does the EAEU have to do with it? Actually, the EAEU provided a legal framework for these efforts and now reaps the benefits of the movement of the labour force on a totally solid legal basis.
We have provided substantial assistance to Kyrgyzstan in building the infrastructure required to ensure the free movement of goods, capital, services and the labour force; we also provide humanitarian support, including assistance to support the country's budget.
The sky is the limit.
But if there is an increasingly widespread opinion in Kyrgyzstan that something needs to be changed, it could be a reflection of a competitive process, competition for Central Asia in which our western partners have actively engaged.
We believe that such competition is counterproductive.
It is more efficient to cooperate in order to help Central Asian counties, including Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, which are particularly in need of such assistance, develop their economies, and ensure stability in the economic sector in general.
We are ready to do this - but regrettably, our western colleagues are not.
When the EU proposed its Central Asia strategy, no mention was made of the SCO, the EAEU and the CIS - the organisations in which Central Asian countries are involved in one way or other.
They were just briefly mentioned as a warning which claimed that efforts should be made to prevent the EAEU, the SCO and the CSTO from hindering the EU's activities in Central Asia.
Similarly, the EU's Eastern Partnership joint initiative for Caucasus and European countries in the CIS territory was aimed at competition and holding back Russia's efforts in these territories.
I would not necessarily see any need to take it into consideration if there is an opinion forming in Kyrgyzstan, due to such programmes and concepts, claiming that changes are needed in the country's relations with Russia.
For instance, we are working jointly with China - both within the SCO and as part of cooperation that is developing between the EAEU and Chinese projects under the Belt and Road Initiative - to unite our resources and efforts in order to help Central Asian countries and ensure their national economies' concordant development and their becoming an essential part of the entire Central Asian economic complex.

Currently, together with our Kyrgyz and Chinese colleagues, we are seeking a common approach to developing Kyrgyzstan's railway network, which will make the country not simply a point of transit to Uzbekistan but will run through its cities and towns and thus help create concurrent production facilities and economic opportunities.
If you, as a person who monitors these sentiments, have specific ideas as to how the EAEU bodies' activity could be adjusted in Kyrgyzstan or ideas regarding Russia's more efficient cooperation with Kyrgyzstan in stepping up bilateral relations, you can forward them to us; we will be pleased to consider them and then continue our dialogue.

Question: I would like to thank you for the help Russia renders to Serbia at this difficult time.
This year on April 24, the UN will mark the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace for the first time.
Do you think multilateralism can become relevant again while the status of Kosovo is being determined?
Sergey Lavrov: I did not know about this day.
In my opening remarks I mentioned the multilateralism development initiative proposed by Germany and France.
I am following this initiative closely.
If the UN General Assembly has decided to mark this day, which symbolises support for multilateralism and diplomacy for peace, then I am very glad about it.
The French-German initiative on setting up a group of friends of multilateralism is developing outside the UN, thereby putting into question the universal nature of the Organisation.
I believe that multilateralism is embodied in the UN Charter.
Multilateralism based on the principles of sovereign equality of states, non-interference and cooperation for the sake of peaceful settlement of disputes – is an absolute requirement of our time.
Thank you for giving me the lead: I will certainly find out how this day will be marked.
We will try to make sure it is marked as widely as possible and help convey the ideas of multilateralism to all nations, so that we use this holiday to strengthen the UN and not to create competitive private mechanisms for promoting dubious ideas.
Question: Russia is Georgia’s third largest trade partner but the absence of embassy missions and trade offices has become an obstacle for large-scale movement of capital, goods, services and workforce between our countries. Is normalization of bilateral ties between Russia and Georgia something that might be possible to speak about?

Sergey Lavrov: I fully share your interest in developing cooperation between Russia and Georgia in a big way for the sake of our two nations.

It was not us who were responsible for severing our diplomatic relations.
By and large, we and you have embassies that are called interest sections.
Georgia has an interest section at the Swiss Embassy in Moscow, while Russia has an interest section at the Swiss Embassy in Tbilisi.
There are no ambassadors but as I understand, they are headed by minister counsellor level people in both countries.
This allows us to maintain ties and not only through our Swiss friends.
There are direct contacts both in Moscow and Tbilisi.
Life takes over.
Needless to say, if we had proper working embassies, it would be possible to solve the issues concerning economic, trade and cultural cooperation not only faster but also in a better way too. This is why we are prepared to restore diplomatic relations.
But since it was not us who were responsible for severing these ties, we will just have to wait for our Georgian colleagues to approach this issue.
Trade offices also suggest the existence of some agreements.
I don’t think that the opening of a trade mission will make much difference and be of a great benefit but should such an opportunity arise we will most certainly consider this offer.
You mentioned that Russia is Georgia’s third largest trade partner. Georgia receives gas from Gazprom, this is a well-known fact.
Regrettably, flights for the time being have been put on hold but I hope we will soon resolve this problem.
The most important thing for us is not to be subjected to a Russophobic campaign in Tbilisi. 
There were excesses during the Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy. They made us think about the security of Russian citizens although the Georgians told us later on that they would be safe.

I am closely following the statements by Georgian leaders, including those made by President Salome Zourabichvili,
who recently came out with a rather crude and aggressive statement about Russia and its goals in the region.
Naturally, when it comes to public opinion, such statements do not help create the right atmosphere.
When Ms Zourabichvili moved from France and became the foreign minister of Georgia, she visited Moscow and I went to Tbilisi.
We discussed the withdrawal of the two remaining Russian military bases from Georgia and finally achieved success.
This agreement was later on approved by President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili.
A legal document, an agreement with the participation of our defence ministers was drafted on the basis of our declaration.
I’d like to recall one interesting moment that shows deal-making skills of the sides and our interest in preserving good relations at that particular time.
Let me repeat: we talked about full withdrawal of Russian military bases from Georgia.
Two bases were withdrawn under the 1999 agreement and two still remained there.
A question was raised about them at a round of negotiations and President Putin decided that if Georgia did not want to keep them, we should withdraw them. This was done. 
Mutual consent to establish a Russia-Georgia anti-terrorist centre near one of these former bases became part of this agreement. 
Russian and Georgian specialists were supposed to work in it.
This was a symbol of our partnership: we are withdrawing bases that have lost their topicality for bilateral relations but we are establishing a centre because terrorism is our common enemy (the situation in the Pankisi Gorge and the rest of the region was turbulent). So, we agreed to establish this centre.

All the agreements were signed, the bases were withdrawn but Georgia simply refused to abide by its own decision to set up this Russia-Georgia anti-terrorist centre.
I believe that if the achieved agreements were respected, the subsequent course of events could have been different.

This would have been a gesture that would have created a foundation for confidence and cooperation in a very sensitive area.
This always promotes rapprochement.
We are ready to positively respond to all constructive steps made by our Georgian neighbours.
We are sincerely interested in this.
Question: Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Elmar Mammadyarov said that Azerbaijan is waiting for the international community to take effective steps for implementing the UN Security Council’s resolution on resolving the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
Do you think there are relevant international institutions capable of living up to these expectations, especially amid the current crisis? Which mechanisms are required to make the adopted but not executed resolutions work?
Sergey Lavrov: The resolutions you are talking about are well-known documents.
They were adopted at the height of the conflict and, above all, stipulated a complete cessation of hostilities and transition to a settlement.
Indeed, they reaffirmed the territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan, but they also contained a demand to stop the war and proceed to talks.
Since then, talks were launched many times.
There were so called Key West agreements of 2001 and subsequent agreements in various formats reached with and without Karabakh’s participation.
Now we have a firmly established format of the talks: Baku – Yerevan – OSCE Minsk Group on Nagorno-Karabakh settlement represented by three co-chairs – Russia, France and the United States – and a representative of the current OSCE Chair.

It is a good and useful format.
It was this format that fulfilled the UN Security Council’s demand to stop the war and begin talks.
There are the Madrid Principles as well as the documents drafted by the Russian Federation in 2010-2011, the so-called Kazan document.
There are draft documents disseminated a year ago (April 2019) at the meeting of Russian, Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers as well as the co-chairs in Moscow.
They are being discussed now.
These documents provide for movement toward a settlement using a stage by stage approach, with the resolution of the most pressing issues at the first stage, such as the liberation of a number of districts around Nagorno-Karabakh and relaunching the transport, economic and other communication lines.
I am sure that when we reach a decision to sign these documents it will be a very important step in implementing the UN Security Council resolution that we are talking about and that, I will say it again, stipulates a cessation of hostilities and the start of talks.
The talks have begun.
Now the parties need to reach an agreement.
This is what we are seeking as co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group on the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
Question: I would like to ask you a question regarding Spitsbergen, I mean the famous Spitsbergen Treaty signed in Paris in 1920 and our tug-of-war with Norway.
The Russian position is clear, as are the Norwegian interests.

However, there are over 40 countries that signed the Treaty in addition to Russia and Norway.
At present, the world media holds that only Russia is opposing Norway.
But in fact there are many more dissatisfied parties.
Do you think it is worth joining efforts with other countries and trying to form a coalition with them, given the Treaty violations by Norway? 
Sergey Lavrov: I agree.
Actually, we have never rejected such a possibility.
We acted in parallel: both within the framework of our relations with Norway and in the course of setting up a coalition in defence of the 1920 Treaty.
As you know, we have not yet established a constructive dialogue with the Norwegians.
I have sent several letters to my counterpart, Norway’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ine Marie Eriksen Soreide, including the latest one this past February in which I quoted specific facts to outline our concerns and named the Treaty’s articles which in our opinion should be observed more scrupulously, and suggested holding consultations.
The fact that our Norwegian colleagues and neighbours, who have always been known for their respect for international law, are evading the very idea of consultations does not make their position more convincing.
I will not go into details, but the possibility that you mentioned is in our sights.
Those who want to defend the Treaty more vigorously include the parties who are doing it for their own benefit based on the rights provided by the Treaty, and some would like to use the Russia-Norway situation to push us to the forefront and wait for the outcome.
There is also a third category of people who very much want the Norwegians to infringe on our rights as much as possible and eventually create conditions for us to wind down our activities: to stop carrying out our tourism projects and producing coal through Arktikugol in Barentsburg.
We understand this very well.
We can see the entire set of these geopolitical games and the tasks for protecting the status of Spitsbergen based on international law.
Question: In the context of the Union State, citizens of Russia and Belarus are concerned with the de facto resumption of border control by Russia during the pandemic.
Rumours have been circulating that subsequently, there may be a fully-functional border between the two states, which is an apparent step towards disintegration of the union.
What is your opinion on the issue?
Sergey Lavrov: We do not see any grounds for introducing a border regime.
Our interests lie in the Union State developing in full compliance with the principles, goals and vectors that were established by the 1999 Union State treaty.
Among other principles, the treaty includes the parties’ obligations to create equal conditions for the citizens of Belarus and Russia in any field of activity – be it the economy, culture, legal relations, etc. In the majority of these areas, equal rights were formalised by separate agreements and treaties.
Currently, several spheres remain that require equalisation – specifically, healthcare services for Russians in Belarus (conditions for them are slightly different) and hotel prices.
But these are minor issues and will most probably be resolved.

As concerns crossing the border, about two and a half years ago, when our Belarusian neighbours unilaterally introduced visa-free entry to Belarus for nationals of around 80 countries, that decision was not agreed upon with us and thus created a situation when foreign nationals that must have a visa to travel to Russia entered Belarus without any visas.

With no border control between Belarus and Russia, foreign nationals who must obtain visas to enter Russia, as per the agreement with their country of nationality, could freely and, therefore, illegally enter Russian territory.
It was then that we proposed that Russia and Belarus agree on a common visa policy and share the lists of those individuals who are banned from entry, the lists compiled on a mutual and reciprocal basis. We needed a common approach to granting visa-free travel to nationals of respective states.
We developed a relevant agreement.
It was initialed in December 2018 and has been awaiting signing for almost a year and a half.

The Russian Government granted us the power to sign the agreement back in December 2018.
I think signing this agreement will, to a large extent, relieve the concerns that you mentioned and remove any remaining reasons for those who wish to create a full-fledged border between the Union State countries.
I think our Belarusian colleagues will, in the short run, somehow communicate their stance to us and confirm the fact that they are ready to sign the document that was initialed a year and a half ago.
At any rate, quite recently, Belarus and the European Union (EU) signed an agreement relaxing their visa regime – a readmission agreement.
It was a helpful move.
We have a similar agreement with the EU.
So, the solution to the problem you mentioned has been ready for a year and a half.
We have the powers to sign it and hope that our Belarusian colleagues have the powers to do so as well.
Question: If the European Union falls completely apart, do you think that its current members could be accepted in the EAEU?
Sergey Lavrov: The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) is open for accession to any country that shares the principles set forth in its core documents.

As for the future of the European Union, I cannot imagine such an outcome, even theoretically.
In this context, the best solution would be to establish contacts between the EAEU and the EU.
We discussed proposals to this effect back in 2015, and Brussels is still exploring them.
The Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) has submitted the corresponding proposals on behalf of the EAEU to the European Commission several times.
The response was initially outright negative, but Brussels became more receptive to dialogue with the EEC once it realised that EAEU member countries have delegated many of their functions to the supra-national level. So far this has been limited to technical matters, such as technical regulations, rules governing various sectors, etc. 
But this is already a start.
These are practical steps that we can build upon to build up our cooperation. We stand for promoting a strategic partnership across the Eurasian continent.

After all, Eurasia covers a huge territory shared by the EU, the EAEU, the SCO and many ASEAN countries as well.
It is also here that most of the projects as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative are carried out.
It is for this reason that back in May 2016 at the Russia-ASEAN Summit held in Sochi President of Russia Vladimir Putin proposed establishing the Greater Eurasian Partnership that would be open to member countries from all these associations, including the EAEU, the SCO, ASEAN, as well as European Union countries and the EU itself.
Sharing this vast territory gives us substantial comparative advantages.
It would be strange for us not to benefit from these advantages and instead to continue down the road of confrontation (I have already mentioned the confrontational scenarios, including the Eastern Partnership and EU’s strategy on Central Asia).
What we stand for is building a Greater Eurasian Partnership by gradually reaching mutual understanding in an increasing number of spheres with a clear benefit for all the parties involved.
I think that moving in this direction would make it easier for the European Union to overcome its internal challenges, while the EAEU will be open to cooperation in the interests of its member countries.
Question: In the beginning you talked about the common energy market and the need for EAEU countries to work together in order to overcome the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
In this context, I have a question on the price of natural gas.
We all know that pricing in this sector is not just a question of business, but largely a political matter.
Armenia and Belarus have been watching Russia reduce prices for EU countries, even post factum, for example for Bulgaria. Friendly Moldova currently buys gas at a lower price than Armenia.
This begs a question why Russia does not cut prices for EAEU countries first before extending this policy to other countries? After all, this would provide other countries with an incentive to join the EAEU and to work with it, because this would offer major economic benefits.
Sergey Lavrov: I understand your question and I see your logic, but in this case we need to follow this logic all the way through.
When the price for Armenia and the Republic of Belarus was two or three times below market prices it was regarded as a given, and no one treated it as a matter of politics.
I believe that allies are definitely entitled to economic advantages. There is no doubt about this for me. However, considering the current price, there are contractual obligations that have to be honoured.
I strongly believe that our allied relations will be taken into consideration when reviewing the recent requests from our Belarusian and Armenian friends.
It would be probably unfair to bring this up only when the situation becomes the direct opposite to what was happening three or four years ago when we established this pricing mechanism with due regard for our obligations as allies.

As for Armenia’s case, Russia’s Energy Ministry and Gazprom oversee this matter.
Armenia’s domestic tariffs have been one of the recurring problems for the past several years. These tariffs hinder the application of the most beneficial pricing mechanisms.
I will not go into any details on this right now.
If we are talking about allied relations, it would be fair to suggest that they should cover all areas.
As far as the economy is concerned, we have high hopes that the court proceedings that have been initiated in Armenia over the past few years against joint ventures, including the South Caucasus Railway, will be settled without mixing in things that are unworthy of allies.
I am being completely open when mentioning this, since Russian companies faced a number of challenging situations.
I hope that we will be able to resolve these matters to our mutual satisfaction.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin recently had a telephone conversation with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.
They see a path for developing our allied relations and strategic partnership.
Let me assure you that both sides are committed to resolving all issues along these lines.
Question: On behalf of the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, we would like to thank the Foreign Ministry for its assistance with returning our leading Siberian scientists from their business trips abroad, specifically, from the United States.
Currently, international research and technical cooperation projects and programmes are being curtailed.
What measures and programmes does the Foreign Ministry plan to use to restore international research links after the coronavirus pandemic? What new opportunities in terms of science diplomacy are opening up for Russia in this situation?
Sergey Lavrov: The Foreign Ministry is not responsible for orchestrating links in science.
We always support scientific ties but they are established directly when a specific research community in our country or abroad asks for our help with finding a partner or communicating certain ideas and proposals to a partner that has already been designated.
We always do this and will continue to do it.
However, by definition our work does not cover the substantive nature of the contacts between our academic institutions and their partners abroad.
It is not our turf, as they say.
If our colleagues in Novosibirsk or any other research centre need our assistance with restoring links or transferring information when this pandemic is over and all the restrictions are lifted (although communications are so developed these days that it should not be a problem at all), we will do our best to help.
Don’t get me wrong, we can’t physically say: “Go ahead, go to Italy or France tomorrow to start developing a vaccine or some new mechanism.”
When you feel you are ready and your partners are ready but something is standing in your way, if we can help, we will be happy to do it.
Regarding the second part of your question, I think science diplomacy serves the interests of everybody without exception.
During more peaceful times, before we were lumbered with this calamity, science diplomacy was put in the context of soft power: presumably, we can develop contacts and show how open and interesting we are, we can be partners in important matters – and in this way influence the general political situation.
I think that now science diplomacy is becoming mainly a tool for creating antidotes for common problems that are threatening the whole of humanity. At the same time, science diplomacy has not lost its function of maintaining contacts between people.
But now it is not so much a soft power with which one country can influence another as it has become an instrument for building good neighbourly relations in everyone’s interests.
It is not a means of somebody achieving their goals at the expense of somebody else.
Therefore, we will support science diplomacy in every possible way.
Once again, it is up to scientists to determine how it should develop and the areas where joint efforts need to be applied.
If you keep us informed about your plans, it will be a great help to us when it comes to offering you assistance.
Question: Thank you for this opportunity to ask a question.
It concerns the issue of the Republic of Moldova’s constant neutrality which you are most likely aware of and have heard about in the course of your work.
We are always very sensitive about and watching closely the relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union.
Any tension between Russia and the EU countries directly affects the situation and sentiments in Moldova as well as Moldova’s relations with Russia.
What do you think about the prospects of Moldova’s permanent neutrality? Can we count on Russia’s possible support in this matter, in strengthening this status and promoting it internationally?
Sergey Lavrov: Not only can you count on our support but you already have it.
Since the very beginning of the post-Soviet stage in the history of Moldova, when, thanks to Russia’s involvement, it was possible to settle a fierce conflict in Transnistria; when foundations for solving this problem were built on a steady long-lasting ground, the basic principles determining Russia’s policy were developed.
According to these principles, we support resolving the issue of Transnistria’s special status within the framework of a united, territorially integral and sovereign Moldova that ensures respect for its neutrality.
In other words, this stance means two very simple things.
We will not support attempts to drag Moldova, along with Transnistria, into NATO.
This is absolutely out of the question.
And we will not support any attempts to take away Moldova’s statehood.
Based on these two principles which, in my opinion, fully serve the core interests of Moldova as a state, I guarantee that we will always be able to find a solution to Transnistria’s problem.
If all the participants in the 5+2 process acted based on this premise, I think the problem would have been resolved a long time ago.
Unfortunately, it is not exactly the case.
Some of our Western colleagues are still pursuing a slightly different agenda that is mainly determined by their overwhelming desire to reinforce and expand the North Atlantic Alliance.
Question: Quite frequently, Russian journalists, scientists, scholars and other people are declared personae non grata in Central Asian countries.
One example is Russian anthropologist Sergey Abashin whose stance differs from the official stance of Uzbekistani officials.

There have been similar cases affecting French, Azerbaijani and other scholars in Iran, Pakistan as well as some other countries, too.
The Russian Foreign Ministry’s response has been slightly different from that of your foreign colleagues.
In your opinion, is the MFA limiting its work to consulting in these matters?
Sergey Lavrov: Frankly speaking, I have not heard about it.
If you send me backup material, we will be able to answer your question.
Overall, international law and the Vienna conventions stipulate that any country has the right to declare anybody a persona non grata without providing an explanation.
To be more specific, I will need more information.
Please send me your material on this and we will make sure to give you a response.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s interview with Russian and foreign media via video-conference on urgent international issues, Moscow, April 14, 2020
Like most of our colleagues in other specialties and professions, we are now working remotely.
This is why we have temporarily suspended our traditional forms of diplomatic activity like personal visits and talks and news conferences and comments that follow them.
We receive questions about Russia’s foreign policy activity in these conditions and so we decided to respond to your request and hold this interview today.
Question: Are you considering changing the travel rules for Russians going abroad during the coronavirus pandemic or after the borders are opened? What would this be? Exit visas, mandatory negative coronavirus testing or something else? Are you discussing this issue now with our partners?
Sergey Lavrov: For now, this issue is not being discussed by anyone.
I don’t think any of our compatriots want to go abroad now.
In principle, bans are not possible because freedom of movement is fixed in our Constitution.
I think the main thing now is to reduce the number of infected people and fatalities as much as possible.
The measures that are being taken by the emergency response centre of the Government of the Russian Federation are well known.
We are strictly guided by these decisions. I would like to talk again about exiting the country.
I cannot even imagine a discussion on this issue on a practical plane.
I would not worry about those who would like to use this constitutional right when physical capabilities, such as air service and other travel modes are restored.

Question: Of course, my question is also about the coronavirus.
Washington continues to criticise the World Health Organisation (WHO).
What does Russia think about this behaviour at a time when the whole world, almost every country without exception, is in the middle of fighting the coronavirus pandemic in cooperation with the WHO? Is this criticism useful and constructive or maybe it is counterproductive now?
Sergey Lavrov: Basically, what the WHO has done and when is well known.
The statistics are available.
I believe that anyone who studies the chronology of its actions, statements and specific decisions will be convinced that the WHO was efficient.
Moreover, the fact that the WHO has played and continues to play a major coordinating role in countering the pandemic is reflected in the recently adopted consensus resolution of the UN General Assembly and the final declaration of the G20 extraordinary summit.
In both cases, the United States supported the consensus documents. We can only assume that this is their official position.
I would certainly warn everyone against any attempt to politicise the coronavirus issue.
Meanwhile, such attempts are not limited to the role of the WHO. Accusations are also being leveled against various countries.
I would concentrate today on specific steps to curb the pandemic and its spread and reduce the damage to a minimum, primarily the health and lives of people.

Later, we will be able to analyse the lessons of the “campaign,” the mistakes and the role of multilateral institutions.
One more statement about the WHO: when talking about its actions, let’s not forget that the United States is its biggest financial contributor, and as such always has priority representation in the structures and secretariats of international organisations. 
Most of the WHO’s key posts are held by Americans. They are certainly specialists and make well-considered professional decisions. 
Question: We have also noted that the spread of the coronavirus has impacted international life, both in the economy and politics. What mechanism, in your opinion, should now be designed to help the leading countries combat the pandemic jointly? Is there a threat to peace and stability in the world at large if the pandemic is not suppressed soon?
Sergey Lavrov: Of course, the pandemic has created very serious problems, the most important of which is saving people’s lives, ensuring their security, biomedical safety and the preservation of the human environment, which should be comfortable and pose no threats to life and health.
The second challenge, which everybody is talking about, is the economy: the economy of certain countries, the global economy, and the way the coronavirus pandemic has affected trade and investment, as well as currency exchange rates. You can see what is happening to the demand for various products that used to be very popular, including energy carriers, of course.
We have to find solutions to all these problems at a gallop, so to say, at the level of individual countries and the organisations of which these countries are members.
This is, undoubtedly, the second critical challenge facing humanity.
The third challenge: the current situation is a test not only for states, but also for integration and other associations that include such states.
I think that after we overcome this global threat using joint efforts and work out an antidote in case such developments recur, we will have to rethink a lot of things concerning the operation of multilateral organisations.
Perhaps we will have a better understanding, for example, of what Europeans think of the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance.
We will have a better understanding of how we should approach cooperation in the post-Soviet space, the activities of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and other associations.
Discussions in such formats as the G20 and BRICS will be very promising.
By the way, let me remind you that BRICS decided to draw up a cooperation programme on vaccine development and application as early as in 2018. 
Our Chinese partners and we think that such preparations are in great demand.
Speaking of Russian-Chinese relations in the context of this pandemic, we have been working together since the very outset of the crisis.
In early February we evacuated our citizens from Wuhan and delivered humanitarian aid there.

Now we are accepting assistance from our Chinese friends, who have passed the peak of the pandemic, and the country and the people have returned to normal life.
I firmly believe that mutual assistance is the key principle that all countries should be guided by at this difficult time.
Question: Can the coronavirus situation affect the plans to hold a summit of permanent members of the UN Security Council, which is tentatively scheduled for this September in New York?
Can this summit be held earlier because of the need to work out a joint response to the corona crisis? Are you discussing the possibility of holding this meeting via videoconference?
Sergey Lavrov: I can say that no specific agreements on the summit timing have been reached.
This concerns the in-person summit, physically uniting the leaders of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and all our partners in the group of five permanent members of the UN Security Council agree on this.
There is an agreement of principle for this event to focus on a large-scale, major analysis of global developments in all areas that one way or another bear on people’s safety and strategic stability.
Its agenda is being discussed in the regular course of business at the foreign ministries level.
I know that September was named as its time but no decisions have been taken so far.
This time should be agreed by a consensus of all heads of state.
As for the possibility of a videoconference, we do not rule it out, though not instead of the core summit, but only if the heads of state deem it necessary, first of all, to consult each other at this stage primarily regarding the immediate tasks on additional steps to combat the coronavirus.
Question: Will the Council of Europe foreign ministers’ meeting be held in Strasbourg in May, as it was planned? For example, you German counterpart Heiko Maas recently said that he wanted very much to meet with you in person as soon as possible and is even ready to wear a mask during the talks.
How realistic are these plans for May?
Sergey Lavrov: Since Heiko Maas said this in public and did not tell me anything directly I also want to convey my invitation to him through you to come here any time if he finds a way to reach Moscow.
As soon as he lands here we will ensure complete safety for him and his delegation as far as their life and health are concerned.



Let him come. Heiko, if you can hear me, I am absolutely serious.
As for the session of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (CMCE), which was to be held in May to conclude the Georgian chairmanship, indeed the Georgians themselves asked to hold it in Strasbourg because of their domestic problems, which I would rather not comment on.
However, in view of the coronavirus, the Council of Europe suggested holding the CMCE session in November in Greece, which is to take over the Council of Europe chairmanship from Georgia.
Question: Could it so happen that once the epidemic is over video conferencing will become more popular in diplomatic affairs compared to traditional talks?
Sergey Lavrov: I think that some aspects of diplomatic affairs will shift toward video conferencing.
Even before the pandemic this method had been used, but it will never replace face-to-face interaction.
As I have mentioned on multiple occasions, there are things that you simply cannot discuss in any way other than eye-to-eye.
Modern means of communication will never replace personal contacts, which does not mean that we do not have to master these tools.
After all, in some instances paper or electronic means of communication cannot be trusted. Instead, what is needed is trust-based and confidential dialogue.

Question: During the weekend, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that Russia and the United States had agreed to set up a working group dealing with outer space.
Why has this become so important now, during the pandemic? What specifically does Russia want to achieve through this working group?
Sergey Lavrov: It is not that we want to achieve anything.
The decision to establish the working group resulted from our long-standing dialogue with the United States on what mechanisms Moscow and Washington believe to be adequate for working on global matters, and what questions can benefit the most from Russia and the US working together.
Of course, space and all space-related matters are one such sphere where we are the two leading nations, as confirmed recently during the conversation between President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the Russian and American crew members of the International Space Station, as well as during telephone conversations between the Russian and US presidents. In particular, the two leaders had a telephone conversation on Cosmonautics Day, April 12, 2020. Overall, Russia and the United States intend to resume substantive efforts on strategic stability.
A few weeks ago the US Secretary of State called me on the phone, and I would like to have another telephone conversation with him in the near future. Mike Pompeo touched upon resuming talks on arms control, and strategic stability in general.


We welcome this kind of interest on behalf of our US partners, since we have been urging them for quite a while now to be more proactive in dealing with these matters.
Deputy foreign ministers of our two countries held a round of consultations, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov representing Russia.
That being said, we want our discussions to be more specific, including on the New START and its future.
We are also open to talking about the development of new technology, including hypersonic weapons. Make no mistake, however, that all aspects and factors affecting strategic stability have to be taken into consideration during these discussions.
This applies to the plans to militarise outer space, strategic conventional weapons, the future of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and many other issues.

We want to discuss all these matters, including those related to outer space.
Regarding space matters, in our contacts with our US colleagues we are ready to go beyond the long-standing Russia-China initiative to prevent the deployment of weapons in outer space.
In fact, the Americans do not want to be alone when they give the green light to this initiative.
However, following up on these discussions we are ready to talk about ways to cooperate in the peaceful use of outer space.
We took note of the memorandum signed by US President Donald Trump on the exploitation of off-Earth resources, including on the Moon.

He emphasised that the approach adopted by the United States to this matter was based on the provisions of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.
Russia is a party to this treaty, just like the United States.
In addition to this, just like the United States, Russia is not a party to another instrument, the 1979 Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.
The number of its signatories is in the lower double digits, and not a single major space power participates in this treaty.
However, both Russia and the United States are committed to the principles set forth in the 1967 Treaty.
Consequently, in the light of the initiatives proposed by Donald Trump (in his memorandum, he stressed the need to ensure that plans to explore and use resources, including on the Moon, must be supported internationally as per the 1967 Treaty) we believe this to be a proper approach and are ready to work together on finding mutually acceptable solutions.
Question: In early April, the Prague authorities demolished the monument to Marshal of the Soviet Union Ivan Konev, whose troops participated in liberating the Czech capital, among other cities.
Russia immediately said it would take the monument back. As far as we know, the Czech Defence Ministry has refused.
What will Russia do next? Does it plan to push for the return of the monument?
Sergey Lavrov: Of course, this Prague municipality’s behaviour is nothing short of being outrageous and cynical.

It is at odds with the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, which we signed with the Czech Republic in 1993, and which contains obligations to preserve war monuments and memorial sites, access to them and obligations to tend to them.


The Czech authorities claiming that this Treaty was not thus violated are disingenuous.
What happened can be described with different degrees of negativity.
Notably, President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman said it was a stupid and ludicrous thing to do.

Frankly, there’s nothing ludicrous about it.
But the fact is that the agreements that have been underlying our relations for over 30 years were thereby undermined.
We are being told that this monument was municipal property.
But we know for sure that this is not the case, because before the demolition it was on the republican list of memorial sites.
We believe that this issue can only be resolved in accordance with the above 1993 Treaty.
By the way, public figures in the Czech Republic who care about this have already expressed their disagreement and indignation.
Public associations and non-government organisations in the Czech Republic filed a lawsuit with the local court against the Prague-6 municipality.
Many non-government organisations are sending materials to the Embassy that emphasise solidarity with our position on the unacceptability of this approach to the outcome of WWII.
An interesting detail transpired.
As you may be aware, this decision was made by the Prague-6 municipality headed by Ondrej Kolar.
His father worked at the Czech Foreign Ministry, he was an Ambassador to the United States and Russia, and now serves as an adviser to a US consulting company, which, please note, drafted a report for the Czech municipal officials, justifying the demolition of the monument.
We will push for our Czech colleagues to honour their commitments under the 1993 Treaty.
We hope they are aware of the risks involved in further aggravating this situation.
Question: At a time when the UN, the WHO and leading world capitals are calling for the consolidation of efforts in the face of a common threat, certain forces seem to be looking for an opportune moment to strike.
This is the case with the demolition of the monument to Marshal Konev and the attempts to foment a conflict in connection with Russia helping certain European countries.
What are these forces? Who stands behind them? What are their goals?
Sergey Lavrov: These are Russophobic reflexes similar to the reflexes discovered by our great scientist Ivan Pavlov.
These reflexes manifested themselves before the pandemic, during it and, unfortunately, will do so after it ends.
There are politicians who operate exclusively on the Russophobic field, because they are unable to do much else.
We know from practice that Russophobia gives them the chance to live a comfortable life and receive support from some capitals.
I don’t think we should name names.
This is sad.
In answer to one of the previous questions, I said we will need to reconsider the role and capabilities of countries in repelling common global threats, and the role, abilities and sustainability of multilateral organisations that these states are part of.
This is true of all the associations in Eurasia, the Euro-Atlantic and other regions of the world.
We will need to decide whether we want to engage in moralising or act morally.
This is one of the key decisions to be made. I think there are good prospects for the concepts focusing on unity of humankind.
Our Chinese friends came up with a concept of a community based on the common destiny of humankind which has come under criticism.
Some suspect that nice words are just a front for the real hidden interests.
That may well be the case.
However, this proposal was put forward for general discussion.
This is a concept that is aimed at combining our efforts.
When the concepts of containing Russia, China, or other countries are put forward, they represent a slightly different, negative philosophy which stems from negativity, emphasising confrontation and fomenting differences.

I think that the people who rule this field will become less popular and relevant after the coronavirus pandemic comes to an end.
Question: About ten days ago Russia delivered a plane-load of supplies to the United States to help fight the coronavirus.
Are there any further plans in Moscow to help its US partners?
You mentioned Russia’s intention to expand dialogue with the Americans, including on strategic weapons and outer space. But for that you will need to have contacts.
Have the contacts at the level of deputy foreign ministers continued remotely?
Sergey Lavrov: The delivery of medical equipment, supplies and personal protective equipment to the United States resulted from a direct agreement between the presidents of Russia and the United States.
Donald Trump said that he was interested in receiving these supplies, and Russia sent them.
You are aware that the relevant business structures in Russia and the United States paid for the deliveries.
We will definitely look into any further requests from the United States for assistance in delivering devices or protective equipment, as was mentioned during the latest telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump two days ago.

I believe that this is what partners do, and these efforts deserve our full support.

As for the talks, we are now all working remotely, as I have already mentioned.
There are things, including in all aspects of strategic stability, that can be discussed during video conferences or teleconferences.

However, it would be advisable to postpone talks on some subjects until face-to-face diplomatic contacts can be resumed.
This is the premise we proceed from.
Question: In your opinion, which of the US and European sanctions should be the first to be lifted? How could it be related to the coronavirus pandemic?
Sergey Lavrov: There could be a direct link between sanctions and the pandemic, and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was very clear when he talked about it.
The same initiative came from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet. In the context of mobilising efforts to fight the coronavirus, among other things, she called for rejecting unilateral sanctions hindering supplies of medical products and other essential products people need in order to follow the advice they get from their doctors.

Unilateral sanctions are illegitimate per se, and sanctions bypassing the United Nations and undermining the pandemic response are totally immoral and inhuman.
We are following events such as Chinese businessman and Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma sending help to Latin American countries. It has been delivered.
By the same token, by dominating the market for these kinds of equipment and relying on the US dollar’s role in international settlements, the Americans have been able to prevent the Cubans from buying medical equipment.
At the same time, it is highly regrettable and unworthy of a great nation that the US unleashed a smear campaign against Cuban doctors working in dozens of countries around the world and helping deliver on the most challenging healthcare tasks.
They have been doing this for many years, working in Latin America and other regions of the world, long before the pandemic.
In today’s environment Cubans have demonstrated the best in their national character, working to overcome great challenges in almost 60 countries, including in Europe and particularly in Italy.
This nation deserves the highest respect for its dignified stance.
It is essential that an international instrument is drafted stating that unilateral sanctions, especially those that touch upon the humanitarian interests of ordinary people, are unacceptable.
The UN General Assembly adopted the first resolution on fighting the coronavirus, and I think that another one will follow.
The Group of 77 and China released a joint statement to this effect as an official UN document, and Russia landed this initiative its full support.
This statement clearly says that unilateral sanctions are unacceptable, especially when the entire humankind is facing this threat.
We are also discussing the UN Security Council’s response to the developments related to the coronavirus.
I strongly believe that in all its resolutions regarding the coronavirus, the Security Council should not fail to raise the subject of unilateral illegitimate sanctions imposed bypassing the UN’s main body.
For many years now, Russia has been promoting together with a number of other countries the concept of a humanitarian threshold beyond which sanctions should not apply.
When our Western colleagues push for sanctions during talks within the UN Security Council, and when they impose unilateral restrictions, they claim that they are targeting regimes rather than people, in order to force regimes to change their position.
This is not the case.
Just look at the outcome of the sanctions in Venezuela, Iran, DPRK, Syria, Cuba and other countries. They have made the lives of ordinary people worse.
For this reason, illegitimate sanctions and the fact that neglecting humanitarian criteria is unacceptable will remain a topical issue, especially once we overcome this crisis.
Question: What do you think about the collection of signatures by representatives of the progressive forces in such countries as Great Britain and France as well as the efforts of some countries to lift the US blockade of Cuba, a policy that becomes absolutely cynical and inhumane when the entire world is fighting against the coronavirus pandemic?
Sergey Lavrov: The policy of blockading Cuba that the United States has been conducting for decades is supported by next to nobody.
The UN General Assembly adopts resolutions annually on the unacceptability of that blockade and demands an immediate end to it.
The latest resolution adopted in November 2019 gained a record number of votes – 187.
Only three countries voted against: the United States, Israel and, unfortunately, Brazil.
Two countries abstained: Columbia and Ukraine, which is also regrettable.
An overwhelming majority of votes urging a stop to this illegal practice is a very powerful signal.
Sad to say, such signals have yet to produce any visible result in Washington, but in our contacts with US colleagues we point out that such an approach is counterproductive.
The people of Cuba are interested in good relations with all countries, including the United States.
We come to this conclusion every time we communicate with our Cuban friends.
Of course, this is only possible on the basis of respect for one another and for the key principles of the UN Charter, that is for sovereignty and the right of peoples to determine their own destiny.

Question: Earlier, you warned against politicising the coronavirus pandemic.
However, this is exactly what’s happening, and Russia is being accused of politicising the pandemic.
EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said in an interview that Russia and China are providing aid to countries, such as Italy, in order to promote their geopolitical role.
What can you say about this? How is Russia's foreign policy really changing amid the coronavirus pandemic? How might global geopolitics be affected by this pandemic?
Sergey Lavrov: With regard to the first part of your question, there are a number of proverbs on this account, such as “people tend to make conclusions about things based on how depraved their mind is” or, if you want, on how well they were brought up; or “everyone talks about their own woes.
" I’m saying this about the people who use purely humanitarian matters to promote geopolitical confrontation.
It is sad to see Mr Borrell say what you quoted.
It is sad that there are people who are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and to portray the developments in Italy almost as a military invasion of NATO and the European Union.
Unfortunately, such material gets published in some Italian media outlets as well.
More recently, the La Stampa newspaper carried an article which, without absolutely any grounds, tried to belittle and discredit the importance of Russia’s aid to Italy.
Let me remind those who resort to such allegations, including my good friend Josep Borrell, of a very simple thing.
Russia provided aid to Italy at the explicit request by the Prime Minister of that country, Giuseppe Conte.
I think that says it all.
The fact that our Embassy in Rome receives dozens and hundreds of calls from ordinary Italians with words of appreciation is the best answer to the insinuations that are being used to belittle the significance of what is happening and give it some kind of a geopolitical hue.
You mentioned that such claims are being advanced with regard to China as well.
Yes, we can see and hear that.

This is also sad, because our Chinese friends have overcome the peak of the epidemic in their country, and now they are getting their economy back on track, and are not shutting themselves for the outside world.
They are using every avenue to help other countries and to share the expertise that they have gained in fighting this scourge in China.
When we hear the argument that China “will have to pay everyone for spreading this infection” and “allegedly someone failed to inform someone in good time,” it is beyond the pale.
I heard someone in London throw some numbers in the air and came up with 3. trillion dollars or euros that China allegedly owes to the EU for damages caused by the pandemic.
Some are saying China’s foreign-based property should be arrested if China fails to pay.
There are officials who are saying this seriously and in public too.
I think this is absolutely unacceptable.

One should not hold other people to his or her own standards, as we are hearing this kind of reasoning primarily from our Western colleagues.
Speaking of shining examples of glory, 550 troops on USS Theodore Roosevelt have been diagnosed with the coronavirus.
This is a quarter, perhaps, even a third of the crew. Reportedly, the coronavirus is on the rampage on other US aircraft carriers as well.
I believe, it is critically important not to point a finger at anyone, but to come to grips with the fact that this is our common misfortune, and we can deal with it only if we join our efforts, rather than try to antagonise a particular country.
Question: I have a question about the working conditions at the Russian Foreign Ministry under the circumstances. The US State Department recently said that over 300 American diplomats have been infected with the coronavirus and four have died.



What about the Russian Foreign Ministry?
Sergey Lavrov: Immediately after the emergency response centre made the corresponding decisions, we introduced precautionary measures at our Ministry and foreign missions.
Approximately half of our employees from the central office and territorial offices are now working remotely.
Only the core staff continues to come to work in the building. We observe social distancing and the necessary sanitary measures like everybody else should be doing.
With regard to our foreign missions, we canceled vacations and business trips.
Our colleagues are working at the embassies and consulates general in full compliance with the sanitary authorities’ requirements.
This implies, of course, some elements of quarantine. In particular, the schools at our foreign missions are now providing education remotely.
This does not always work out well, and there are occasional technical difficulties, but we just have to do so under the circumstances.
All our employees working onsite are checked daily.

So far, so good, and I hope that if we continue to comply with the requirements issued by Rospotrebnadzor and the Healthcare Ministry we will emerge from the pandemic unscathed.
Question: My question is about the future.

Throughout the 75 years since the end of the last world war that shaped the current world order, countries, including Russia, have been seeking to stem the outbreak of another massive war.
Unfortunately, it has broken out recently.
This is a war for life, and it has engulfed the entire world, as high-flown as this may sound.

The pandemic will end sooner or later, but the world will never be the same.
Today, every country literally stands its own ground, despite the fact that Russia has been helping Italy, the United States and Serbia, as we have already mentioned.
Russia in turn has been receiving aid from China.
However, there is a lack of global unity and joint efforts to fight the pandemic.
In addition, the existing alliances have proven ineffective in these conditions.
In your opinion, how will all this affect the future world order? What will it look like after the pandemic?
Sergey Lavrov: In my response to one of the first questions I said that apart from fighting the pandemic and resolving economic problems at the national and global levels the third greatest challenge is to understand what lies ahead for multilateral institutions, what role they will play in the future and whether they will remain relevant.
The outcome of the fight against the coronavirus will show which countries and multilateral structures have withstood the test of this horrible threat, this crisis.
I understand your concern that the egoistic aspirations we are currently witnessing in the behaviour of some countries could prevail, leading to future attempts to self-insulate from the outside world.
We are already witnessing anxious debates about Schengen Area countries on their shared future and neighbourly relations.
In the end, I think that a collective approach will prevail.
It may take some time though.
It will require meetings and persuasion.
However, this is the only possible way forward.
At this point in time, we must not lose hope and must do everything to make sure that this crisis inoculates nations against egoism, messianism and the temptation to pursue their interests to the detriment of others.
This will not happen overnight.
There is a growing body of evidence showing how difficult it is to fight these kind of threats alone.
We also need to rely on persuasion.
Russia proposes holding a highest-level meeting of the five UN Security Council permanent members, and their leaders will definitely ponder the future operation and role of multilateral institutions as part of their discussion on international stability and security.
Question: I have a question on humanitarian assistance to other countries.
What has been the response? What have you heard? Can we expect European countries to adopt a more favourable position towards Moscow leading to the possible lifting of sanctions?
Sergey Lavrov: As we have said on a number of occasions, we will not even mention the topic of sanctions.
If the European Union understands that this method no longer serves its purpose and moves away from the decisions adopted in 2014, we will definitely reciprocate.
But we will not ask for it.
Furthermore, I have already said many times that while our partners let us down and waived their obligations on a number of matters, we opted for a path of promoting self-reliance regardless of any shifts in the mood of our Western colleagues.
This will not mean isolation, absolutely not.
We have always been open to full, equitable and mutually beneficial cooperation.
However, considering how the West acted after 2014 it is our duty to shield ourselves from similar excesses on behalf of our Western colleagues.
Let me remind you that regarding what happened in Ukraine in 2014 the West is to blame, since it was France, Germany, Poland and the United States who lobbied for the deal signed between then-president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovich and the opposition, as witnessed by Paris, Berlin and Warsaw and with their written approval.
And when the deal was trampled upon the very next morning, all our Western colleagues proclaimed without hesitation that “democracy prevailed.
I have commented on this subject on multiple occasions.
We reject all sanctions imposed bypassing the UN Charter, but this is not the time for us to prioritise the lifting of sanctions in our relations with the European Union.
We will show patience and focus on acting constructively within our country and in our relations with those who are ready to move forward without any reservations.
By the way, there are quite a few countries of this kind in the European Union too.
I hope that we will all draw the appropriate conclusions from this crisis.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s interview with Novy Vek TV and Radio Company, Moscow, March 22, 2020
Question: Mr Lavrov, how do you estimate the effectiveness of the Republic of Tatarstan’s contacts with the outside world?
Sergey Lavrov: The Republic of Tatarstan is perhaps one of the most pro-active regions of the Russian Federation in terms of its involvement in international and foreign economic ties of the Russian regions.
We maintain very close collaboration.
The republic, first, is itself highly active in promoting its presence abroad.
If I am not mistaken, they have representative offices in 15 countries, where they operate in close contact with and under the guidance of Russian Federation embassies.
The republic has ramified ties primarily with CIS partners, such as Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, as well as with practically all the other former republics of the USSR, which are now members of the CIS.It also maintains close contacts with companies from the US, Europe, and other regions, too. 
Over a period of the past few years, the republic won the first prize for creating a maximally favourable investment climate for foreign investors on three occasions.
Last year, it came second, but it was the leader for the three previous years and I am sure that Tatarstan has preserved its leader ambition that will be manifested many times over.
This is one of the most pro-active republics, one of the most advanced constituent entities of the Russian Federation, which has the taste and skill for operating on the foreign markets and for creating conditions enabling investments to come to the republic.
Question: Russia has 85 regions.
How great, in your opinion, is the Russian regions’ international role?
Sergey Lavrov: As they said in the past, Russia will grow based on Siberia.
Today, Russia is growing – in its activity, in politics, and in the economy – based on its regions, territories, republics and autonomous areas.
What is happening today in our relations with the PRC, 70-80 percent of trade and investment is about ties encouraged by the Russian regions and China’s provinces.
When Tatarstan or other Russian regions promote their goods abroad, when they court high technologies as investment in Russia, when they engage in humanitarian activities (Tatarstan regularly accompanies its economic events abroad with humanitarian meetings), they are strengthening, first, this country’s economic potential, and, second, its prestige in the eyes of international community.
So, one can hardly overestimate the importance of this work.
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s interview with Saturday news show Vesti v Subbotu, Moscow, March 21, 2020
Question: For you, Sri Lanka is your youth.
What did you feel when you came back here? We are now in the new Embassy building, while you worked in the old building.
Still, what memories did it stir up from when you worked here?
Sergey Lavrov: Of course, I mostly remember the old building where I worked for four years.
I was an aide to Soviet Ambassador Rafik Nishanov, God bless him.
We created a tight-knit group of MGIMO graduates and more experienced personnel, including first secretaries and councillors.
We played football and volleyball.
We had a club, which no longer exists.
The leased building was returned to local authorities because the new Embassy has a club on its premises.
There is one thing that comes to mind first of all. A small viper crawled into my office in the old building.
The air conditioners were installed in the wall and the snake crawled through a small gap between the air conditioner and the wall.

We got rid of it very quickly, but after that all offices were inspected to see if any gaps in the walls needed to be closed.

In addition to the club where we met every weekend, I also have warm memories of our sports games.
By the way, we also watched films at the club.
It was a good tradition.
Nowadays the embassies seldom hold film screenings.
Everyone can watch what they like at home.
Question: What films did you watch back then?
Sergey Lavrov: We were sent good Soviet films, which are shown on television even now. We also liked to play beach football.
Diplomatic couriers delivered mail and collected our mail once a month.
Many of them were good athletes, including football players who held the title of merited athlete.
For example, Dynamo player Vladimir Savdunin played football with us.
Others included players from the Spartak club.
It was fantastic: we were very young then and we had a chance to play football with world famous athletes.
I also remember the trips we made.
Sri Lanka is a beautiful country.
It takes a few hours’ drive to the mountains where people use wood-burning stoves, or tea plantations, the former British settlements which have been turned into recreation spots open to all.
There is a place in Sri Lanka that is known as World’s End.
It is believed that Adam lived there after he was expelled from Paradise.
There are many interesting places on the island.


I would recommend travelling there, if possible.
It is a bit like Sochi, with both the sea and the mountains nearby. They don’t ski there, but the mountains are certainly good for hiking.
Sri Lanka has a very interesting history.
I also recommend visiting Sri Lanka’s old capital, Kandy.
We are developing bilateral tourism.
I have held talks with President of Sri Lanka Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and my colleague, Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, and it turned out that the number of Russian tourists in Sri Lanka increased by 30 percent to some 85,000 in 2019.
Our colleagues are delighted, first by the increase itself and, second, because, apart from absolute figures, Russian tourists spend more money per capita than tourists from other countries.



So, we have good prospects.
Our mutual trade is growing as well.
I remember that the idea of a new embassy building was aired back when I was working at the Soviet Embassy here in 1975-1976.

In other words, things were not moving fast enough, but it is the result that matters.
I believe the result is quite good. One can live and work here very well.
Question: Do you still remember any behests or advice you received from Rafik Nishanov?

Sergey Lavrov: He is a wise man.
It is difficult to formulate his behests, but he showed what diplomacy was by his very behaviour and the way he worked and communicated with our foreign colleagues.
Always courteous, he never offended anyone even with a hint and he always showed that he heard what his interlocutor was saying.
When your response includes minor details your interlocutor used, it shows that you listen to and hear what is being said.
Rafik Nishanov also has a fine sense of humour.
When he greeted me with “Hello, Marxist” upon his arrival at the embassy – I usually sat at my desk by that time – it meant that he was in a great mood and everything went very well that day.
In general, he seldom lost his temper.
Of course, there were some critical situations; we had our ups and downs.
There were car accidents involving our personnel, which is a nervous situation, but he always settled any problems we had, bless him.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s opening remarks during a joint statement for the media with Foreign Minister of Hungary Peter Szijjarto, Moscow, March 18, 2020
Ladies and gentlemen,
We have held some very useful talks.
We have discussed a wide spectrum of our bilateral relations, primarily in the context of the efforts being made to implement the agreements reached on September 30, 2019, during President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Budapest and following his talks with Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
We have confirmed our shared interest in thoroughly developing our trade, economic, investment, cultural and humanitarian cooperation and we have mapped out specific steps to encourage the advancement in all these spheres.
We have discussed in detail our cooperation in the military memorial field, something that we regard as particularly important in the light of upcoming events dedicated to the 75th anniversary of Victory in WWII.
Russia is consistently advocating – and President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said as much – the preservation of historical memory and is opposing attempts to falsify history and international legal results of the WWII.
We have exchanged views on the measures being taken by our two countries in connection with the coronavirus pandemic.
We have spoken about relations between the Russian Federation and the EU. We see eye to eye on the fact that these ties are far from being rosy.
There are numerous reasons for promoting mutually beneficial projects in a number of areas.
Russia-NATO relations are of no small importance in the context of European affairs.
We have invariably favoured them to be built on the principle of equal and indivisible security, as was repeatedly reaffirmed within the framework of the OSCE.
Proclaimed at the top level in the OSCE, this objective is at odds with the eastern expansion of NATO’s military infrastructure and its attempts to view joint work as a zero-sum game.
We value Hungary’s position with regard to the situation in the Euro-Atlantic region.
Budapest has always advocated dialogue and is against an artificial confrontation.
This, as I believe, is the only reasonable stance.
Russia and Hungary hold rather similar positions on the settlement of various crises in the Middle East and North Africa, including the Syrian settlement and the Libyan crisis.
Today, we have agreed to invigorate our efforts with a view to implementing the joint initiative that was discussed during President Vladimir Putin’s visit last October.
What I have in mind is rendering assistance to Christian communities in the Middle East.
In Ukraine, we are committed to implementing the Minsk Agreements approved by the UN Security Council and the decisions accepted by the Contact Group and the Normandy Four.
Both our countries are concerned with Ukraine ensuring the rights of ethnic minorities, including educational and linguistic.
This is required by the Ukrainian state’s international obligations and the Ukrainian Constitution.
On the whole, I regard this visit by my colleague and friend as quite timely and I am satisfied with how we have discussed the situation regarding bilateral relations and on the international arena.
