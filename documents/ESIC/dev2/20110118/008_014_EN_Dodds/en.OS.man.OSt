This report highlights the need for food security and for the citizens whom we represent.
It also emphasises the important public goods which farmers produce, often with little or no recognition.
However, I feel that there is going to be a problem.
I have heard recently major speeches which indicate that the common agricultural policy should actually shift to become an environmental policy.
This I think will ultimately lead us to be mistakenly believe that we can do without European farmers, maybe just import the food from outside of the EU.
This should not be the case.
Our farmers should be supported to produce food in a way which is not harmful to the environment.
And as for importing food, world markets are simply too volatile, both in terms of price and in terms of consistency of supply.
There are a number of things that we must do.
We must have a strong budget for the common agricultural policy.
We must encourage young farmers into the industry to secure a future for it.
We must have more research and innovation to make production methods more efficient. And we must have less red tape, and certainly no green tape to tie up our farmers.
