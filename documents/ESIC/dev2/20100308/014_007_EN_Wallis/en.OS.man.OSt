It being International Women's Day, I wanted to raise a particular female health issue that persistently still remains a Cinderella issue.
I stood here two, maybe three years ago talking about a silent, unseen, painful and debilitating female illness, endometriosis.
An illness that destroys lives, families and fertility.
You see, some women don't even have the chance to be mothers.
Maybe it's because it's about women's menstruation that we don't want to talk about it.
Don't even want to name it.
So I'll say it again: endometriosis.
It still has no known cause, still no known cure and still affects up to one in every ten women and rising.
This week is also Endometriosis Awareness Week across Europe.
So, when are we going to take those women, their families and their sufferings seriously?
It's good that you are here, Commissioner, to hear.
Perhaps proper dedicated funding and I hope, before next year.
