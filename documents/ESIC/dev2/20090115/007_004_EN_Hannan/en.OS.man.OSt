Mr President, first of all I was delighted to see that no action was taken against Members who decided to demonstrate during this vote with their "Stop the war" placards and their Palestinian flags. I hope we have now set the precedent that, unlike those who demonstrated for a referendum, we accept the right of making a peaceful point in a eh eh in a suitable manner as part of the democratic process. Like everybody else in this Chamber, of course I am horrified by what's been happening in the Middle East. The losers are not one side or the other but people of good will throughout the region. There are eh Gazan families peaceably trying to bring up their children, who are horrified at the hell unleashed on them by the rocket launches. There are Israelis who understand that one day an independent Palestine will be their neighbour and that actions of this kind are unlikely to make it a benign neighbour. But in the current circumstances, nobody wants to listen to such voices. I would just say that I'm puzzled by the resolution's insistence on proportionality. I'm not sure what proportionality means. Would critics of the Israeli Government be happier if it had rained an equivalent number of rockets randomly on Gazan villages? I see your gavel raised so I will simply say that I hope that the that the cease fire is quickly negotiated and that we can get back to talking and to resolutions peacefully.
