Mr President, the European Parliament is the only EU institution that is elected directly by the citizens of the EU.
It has also been called the conscience of Europe.
This conscience has been burdened throughout the years with the conflicts provoked by Russia.
Remember the war in Chechnya, remember Ukraine, trucks queuing up for weeks on Finnish, Estonian and Latvian borders, the frozen conflict in Transnistria cyber attacks on Estonia a ban on Polish meat.
All that been topped up with Russia's aggression against Georgia.
I am worried that the EU is displaying only timid reactions, tiptoeing around instead of discussing sanctions.
We are only encouraging Russia for some more irresponsible behaviour.
Mr President I am convinced that a clear conscience in relation to Russia is not a luxury that the European Union cannot afford.
Thank you.
