Dear Mr President, Madam High Representative. I was good to hear what you said and we fully agree what you what you said And it's very important that the European Union has been able to react to the failure of the Belarusian pre presidential elections. I wish that we had the courage to be as vigorous, firm and principled also in the case of a neighbouring country of a Belarus Where the suppression of the democratic opposition, violations of the rule of law and of human rights have also become commonplace. The deterioration of democracy in Russia might also be the very reason why the Kremlin has recognised the Belarusian presidential elections and described the violent repression as an "internal affair" of Belarus. Such indifference to the appalling situation in Belarus is a significant sign of tendencies in Russia. Ladies and Gentlemen, the European Parliament has become up with a strong resolution that proposes targeted visa and economic sanctions against criminal regime of Lukashenko. It is vital that the European Union stands united on this and that the same that the Member States cease pursuing any bilateral initiatives with Lukashenko and his regime. We must suspend the Eastern Partnership and other cooperation until the political prisoners are released. At the same time, we must increase the support to the civil society, NGOs and independent media in Belarus in order to prepare them for the build up of Belarus after the downfall of Lukashenko. That will hopefully take place by means of democratic elections. Therefore, I would like you to support calling for a pan European... Thank you Madam forum on the future of Belarus. it's end of time. Thank you very much.
