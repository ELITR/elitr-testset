Well, let me start from the last question.
It's Commissioner Barnier, who is dealing with this question.
Of course, I will be following very closely to what he will do.
And I understand he is going to present a Green Paper in 2011 in order really to start the consultation on this very important issue.
And I assure you that because of my interest in my portfolio, I will follow very closely what will happen.
Of course as I said in my introduction, I'm going to present a communication on sport.
It will be the first ever communication presenting the political agenda on sport.
Hopefully beginning of January, and all these issues, all these issues which you have mentioned Madam will be discussed in the course of this communication.
And the first presentation and discussion will take place, as indeed I said, during the structured dialogue in the context of the sport forum in Budapest next February.
Thank you.
