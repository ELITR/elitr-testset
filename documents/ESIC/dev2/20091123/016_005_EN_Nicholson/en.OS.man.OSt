Thank you very much President.
The point I want to rise is a serious problems concerning the "right of ownership" continue to cause to many European Union citizens who have invested in property in countries such as Spain, Bulgaria and Turkey stress, financial ruin and general heartache.
This is despite the concerted efforts of many MEPs working on behalf of their constituents and lengthy investigations by the Parliament into the issue, which, we know, has culminated in the well-received Auken report in March 2009.
I have received complaints from many constituents regarding the problems arising from property deals in all these countries.
Countless people have found themselves in situations whereby complex zoning laws, urbanisation policies have meant that their properties have been seized without any compensation.
I am greatly concerned that more definitive action has not been taken by the EU to attempt to address this problem, despite the overwhelming consensus that it violates the basic rights of European Union citizens.
The legality and morality of these practices are the best questionable and most unveils the corrupt approach by urban development.
Thank you President.
