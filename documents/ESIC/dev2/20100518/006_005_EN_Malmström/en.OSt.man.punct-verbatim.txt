So I will start... Ehm Honourable members, Honourable Mr Coelho, Mr Alvaro. Thank you very much for for your interventions and thank you for the very constructive way that we have been cooperating on this extremely complicated file that I inherited. It is complicated indeed, but I am determined to work together with you in order to get this right in a transparent way and to see the project completed. The vote tomorrow is very timely for the SIS II project. The Council has confirmed that the Milestone I test was successful and that the development of SIS II should continue on the basis of current technical solutions. The legislative proposals before you con contained three substantial elements. And Mr Coelho made reference to them, and that will change the development of the project. First, as Mr Coelho said, the initial expiry date of the instruments, 30 Junel this year has become unrealistic and will therefore be changed. This will allow the SIS II project to continue in the light of technical requirements and a global schedule which are currently being redefined with the Member States's experts. And it will be available for the Council 3 and 4 June The rapporteur calls for a specific deadline for SIS II development. And I'm sorry to tell you that the Commission is yet not in a position to take up that proposal. The Commission's experts, together with all Member States, are in the process of finalising the adaptation of requirements and the new global schedule. Once this is done, the Commission will make appropriate suggestions in the light of the new global schedule to be presented at the next Justice and Home Affairs Council in two weeks. Secondly, the Global Programme Management Board is a group of technical experts advising on SIS II development and that should be formalised. The global management board has already proven to be a very good tool of cooperation and technical analysis between Commission and Member State experts. The proposal will make sure that this is continue whilst streamlining the board's role, composition and procedures. For this reason, that it is a purely technical body, it is not appropriate to open the board to MEPs and other parliamentary officials. We will continue to move forward on SIS II in a transparent way with the European Parliament, but we must keep a clear distinction between the technical work and political transparency. But in this spirit, the Commission is open to provide full technical information to the Members of this House by making available the reports of the board to the Parliament, in line with what Mr Coelho suggests. Thirdly, the necessary legal flexibility to carry out the development through an alternative technical scenario would be foreseen. And I believe that we all agree of the rationale of this. As regards the budgetary aspects of continuing SIS II development, the Commission shares the rapporteur's aim to make the most efficient use of taxpayers' money. And in this context, the report requests to reserve Parliament's right to put funds for SIS II development for 2011 in budgetary reserve. This is, of course, entirely within the discretion of the budgetary authority. From the point of view of budgetary implementation, I would only ask Mr Alvaro if it could be some sort of clear and efficient de blocking procedure for the case then when we would need the money. And I would like to end by thanking the LIBE committee, Mr Coelho and the rapporteur of the COBI Committee, Mr Alvaro, for their excellent cooperation on this file. And let me know, Madam La president , if you agree to say a few words. Eh I'm sorry that Mr Tavares is not yet here. We had possibility to discuss with him on this extremely important subject, the EU resettlement programme. As you know, a large majority of refugees worldwide are hosted in countries like Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Many of these refugees find themselves in insolvable situations. They cannot return to their country of origin, nor can they integrate locally in the country of first asylum, since many of these countries are themselves victims of conflict or poverty. For these groups of refugees, resettlement can be the only solution. And through resettlement, the Member States of the European Union can demonstrate concrete solidarity with these often over burdened countries of first asylum. At the same time give protecting to some of the most vulnerable refugees under sustainable and humane conditions. Today, resettlement is carried out, but there is no structural coordination at EU level. The Commission believes that the EU can play a bigger part and be more active on resettlement by strengthening the Union's role globally a and showing solidarity with the most affected regions. The proposal tabled in September 2009 aims to improve the situation. We are very satisfied by the very positive response which European Parliament and the Council has given to the proposal. And I would really thank Mr Mr Tavares for his strong work on this and the strong political consensus among the different groups on this matter. The idea in the proposal is that the EU will, in partnership with the UNHCR, contribute to more strategic use of resettlement on the basis of an annual decision on the common priorities for resettlement. By pooling the national quotas, the EU can help to alleviate some of the most difficult conflicts eh in the world and in the refugee situations. The programme leaves to each Member State the final choice on the the number of refugees, of course, to be resettled, it although it will enable them to coordinate and mutualise experiences and best practices. And through the annual acces exercise, the EU will be able to be more reactive in evol to evolving challenges and global refugee needs to render more efficient the Member States's use of the European Refugee Fund. The programme will also help in a more targeted and practical cooperation project through the Asylum Support Office, both between national administrations and civil society organisations. And I share the idea of the rapporteur to create a specialised unit in the office to be established in Malta. The Joint EU resettlement programme is discussed at a crucial moment. Since 2007, five Member States, in addition to those who already had the programmes, have decided to start national resettlement programmes. And several other Member States have resettled Iraqi refugees over the past year in response to a commitment agreed at EU level in 2008. And it is crucial that we maintain this positive momentum and that the adoption of the proposal is not delayed. We regret, however, that there are some divergences and questions of procedure and they're hampering a rapid adoption of this proposal. It is of course of great political significance that we can have this proposal. The decision by the Commission to establish annual priorities for resettlement is of implementing nature, as part of the financial management of the European Refugee Fund. And with respect to the so called "delegated acts" procedures, we are concerned that the procedure would be considerably delayed, making management of the fund very difficult. This is a first step towards a common approach. A review of the experience will of course be be made. And the presentation of more ambitious initiatives are also foreseen in the light of the Stockholm Programme. Thank you very much, Madam President.
