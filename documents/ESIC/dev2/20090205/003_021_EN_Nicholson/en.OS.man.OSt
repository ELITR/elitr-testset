...very much President.
First of all I welcome the report and wish to congratulate the rapporteur.
I think to be commended for this report and hard work he presented.
Yes Mr President we do need transparency, we must knowwhat is in compound feed, there is no doubt about that.
I have no problem with a keeping the company's intellectual property rights confidential.
But events recently in the Republic of Ireland, with the dioxin problem, bring home very clear to all of us the need for control.
The farmer can have the highest possible standards of livestock husbandry and do everything right.
But, as we witnessed, all can be lost when events way beyond their control destroy all their good and hard work.
