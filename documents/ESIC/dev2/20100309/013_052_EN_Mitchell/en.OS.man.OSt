Thank you Mr President and thank for her reply.
Look, as far as I am concerned, hammer the terrorists, hammer the criminals.
I have no problem with that whatsoever.
But what I am concerned about is that we, as parliamentarians, are not stressing sufficiently, either in the European Parliament or in Member States, that we expect that to be done in a way that protects the public.
Not undermine the public or their privacy, that data is protected, the privacy is protected and that citizens who are innocent and law abiding are not subject to intrusion by the State.
It is imperative that this is included.
Thank you Mr President.
