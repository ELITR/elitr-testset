Thank you mise Mr President. We are taking that exercise very seriously. I think it was now very important to agree on this called what we called the European Semester. Because Member States have now agreed unanimously that matters of economic policy of one may also have an effe effect on others, and the others have an effect on their own policies. And so of course we are going to make recommendations in this matter, depending also on the programmes that the Member States will present to us. But we are doing that to make the live of our citizens better. We are of course making it clear that all the efforts of fiscal consolidation, all the efforts of structural reform, are in fact for growth, sustainable growth, inclusive growth. This is the goal of the European Union. And this was the overall agreement on what we have called the Europe 2020 Strategy. And it is at the light of these priorities that we are going to judge the eh national programmes that are now going to be presented. And that upon which we are going to work in partnership with our Member States.
