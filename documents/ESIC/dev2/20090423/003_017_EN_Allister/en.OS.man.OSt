Thank you President.
I join in the best wishes to our rapporteur, wishing him a speedy recovery and return.
Obtaining the best service for our constituents is, I'm sure, in the interests of us all.
But for me it is vital that this directive gets the balance right between freedom of movement versus patient safety and accountability.
I have no interest in promoting medical tourism.
I do believe, that therefore national autonomy on regulatory aspects must be protected.
And we must avoid the harmonisation of standards to the lowest possible denominator.
We must also guard against increased pressure on local services to the detriment of indigenous patients.
And that is particularly relevant in areas where there are specialisations which people would seek out.
Moreover, the issue of follow-up care as resulting from foreign treatment must be adequately addressed.
Because I do have concerns that services such as physiotherapy and matters like that could be overstretched because of the follow-up care demands
