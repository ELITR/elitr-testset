I really would like to join the chorus of thanks and congratulations, because this evening there are not a formality. Commissioner Tajani for your personal commitment, the Council for your flexibility and, of course, colleagues, that have been reaching this compromise in first reading that is so important for us business. Ma≈Çgorzata, in particularly you, my friend from the EPP. Being a businesswoman myself before entering this House, I really know that late payment is one of the main obstacles for small companies. Sometimes, it means bankruptcy. Other time, at the best, it means uncertainty and damaging business. I it of course a major achievement that we could limit 60 days of payment period for administration, as public authorities, as Commissioner Tajani just said, have it in the pipeline, so it is a matter of reducing bureaucracy. But I'm also glad that we have introduced BtoB as small businesses now have a clear legal framework to be able to dare, sometimes they didn't even dare claim the late payments towards big companies. I believe that we have found a good balance between respecting freedom of contract, which is absolutely important. But at the same time we have provided the necessary tools to small companies to avoid being held hostages by bigger company or public administration. Instead of spending their time chasing debts, they can now devote their resources to effectively exercise their right of payment, interest and compensation. I believe this agreement should be a tool to deter late payments. Rather than being a tool of paying late payments. An to us har as Malcolm Harbour was saying, to really create a culture of paying in time which will make a better functioning to the internal market and, of course, benefit all the stakeholders. We have shown thatthe Parliament can take concrete measures that can really make a difference and create more jobs and facilitate SMEs. Now, Mrs Chair, the real important issue is for the Council and the Member States to take their responsibility to make sure that these rules are properly enfo enforced home. Thank you.
