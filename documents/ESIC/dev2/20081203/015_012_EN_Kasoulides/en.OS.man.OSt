Chairman, thank you. If the debate today had a subject the situation in the Gaza Strip, I might have joined Mrs De Keyser and all the other colleagues across the floor on claiming the same positions. But I'm afraid I am afraid that this political linkage with the upgrading of the participation of one of the ENP countries, and particularly the countries in the Mediterranean, has created a precedent where I don't know how we're going to come out of it. We have not listed political conditionality on issues of bilateral relations within the EU ENP policies. In the case of Morocco, for instance, we have never mentioned for instance Wester Western Sahara or human rights. In the case of Egypt, in the case of any country in the Mediterranean. And I cannot understand why this time we have chosen this political linkage. Secondly, it is of my view that the more you engage in dialogue, and in cooperation and in in trust, as Minister Jouyet has said, with any of the countries' partners, the more you have influence on them. We have shut a door today and I don't know how we are going to open it. And thirdly, I am sure that the way we are proceeding today, we have put a condition. It's just a deferral, we have said, we are going to come back to it. How are we going to come back to it? When will the situation in the Gaza Strip be so satisfactory that we will decide to come back to it? When, as you have said, Mrs Napoletano on the issue of the of the settlements. Or so many other issues we want to influence positively Israel, when are we going to feel politically satisfied in order to bring back this fine eh resolution prepared in Foreign Affairs? Thank you.
