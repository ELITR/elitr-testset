Thank you Madam President.
I think our expectations at this stage from Copenhagen are being lowered, but it's true that our ambitions can't be lowered.
And I think if we could accentuate the positives, in the climate change debate as other colleagues have said, for economies and for citizens, there might be more traction.
Because there are positive sides to this debate.
And while there may not be a binding agreement out of Copenhagen, I think there is no doubt that there is a momentum for change.
And we have to make sure that the momentum is not lost.
On the issue of land use, agriculture and land use change, this is a key area of concern.
And obviously, agriculture is both part of the problem but also a big part of the solution.
And I think we have to link this debate with our concerns about global food security.
And the answer is to develop sustainable production systems which manage climate and also provide us with food security.
This is a key part of our concern.
Thank you.
