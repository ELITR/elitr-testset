...on an agreement between the European Union and Pakistan.
The agreement appears to enhance the ability of nation states, or Member States I should say, to return illegal immigrants to Pakistan.
On the face of it, that would seem to be desirable for the United Kingdom, but it should only be for Britain, as an independent sovereign nation state, to decide who can and cannot enter her borders.
To vote in favour of this agreement would be to cede that right to the European Union, something I could not possibly do.
Britain must gain control of its immigration policy, legal and illegal, and not surrender it to the European Union.
