...President. Tomorrow we will be voting on the Draft amending budget number 7, which covers the guarantee that the EU has been asked to provide for the European financial stabilisation mechanism. This mechanism, which makes it possible for the Union to borrow funds in the capital market and then loan to Member States in financial difficulties, implies that if a Member State is not able to reimburse the p the loan, the European budget would be used to cover the debt. Colleagues, I call your attention to the fact that the guarantors of this financial stabilisation package are actually the Member States, many of which are themselves in the middle of a financial crisis. We are talking about 60 billion euro. This is not a token. We are planning to find the money if the guarantee has to be honoured, where? How can we vote in favour of such an amending budget when the Commission has not established priorities for spending from the budget in case the European Union was called to honour the guarantee? If we act with responsibility in defence of constituents' interests, even if we are being told that the risk is low, we should vote against this resolution. Thank you.
