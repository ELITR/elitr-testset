Mr President. In case of online gambling, there must be clear and unambiguous laws that serve to limit, control and account for the nearly 3 billion euro in yearly gross revenue realised by the gambling industry. However, according to Mrs Schaldemose, this 3 billion euro is only 5 percent of what the total gambling market in the European Union is. Therefore, the importance and influence of this industry is obvious, as are the dangers of it. Gambling is often correctly associated with the crime on the international level. Cross border gambling rings which are much easier to run via Internet jeopardise the laws of vari varying nations and harbour risks to national sovereignty. It is also important to note the negative health effects associated with gambling. As a medical doctor, I am well aware of the da damaging characteristics of obsessive or addictive gambling. These are not issues that the European Parliament can underappreciate. When it comes to tackling the fraud, criminal behaviour or financial and medical issues that correspond to online gambling, I call upon the E European Parliament to vote repeatedly and better and better in future on solutions. Thank you very much.
