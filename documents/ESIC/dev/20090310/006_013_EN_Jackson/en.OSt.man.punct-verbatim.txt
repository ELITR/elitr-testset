Thank you President. At the heart of this directive is the problem of control and of costing. How can we ensure that laws adopted by the EU as a whole actually are applied. And how can we legislate without knowing the cost of what we want? The rapporteur wants to bring in a universal system of uniform emission limits. Which would have to be worked out in a huge bureaucratic exercise that would take at least eight years. No one knows how much it would cost. It's called the European safety net. I Amendment 134 staying outside the high emission industries with standards based on best available techniques, leaving the implementation of such measures to the discretion of the Member States. I think this is realistic and affordable and observes the principle of subsidiarity. If the European safety net is adopted, I hope the Council and the Commission put pressure on the Parliament to have an impact assessment done on the idea. The question is whether we have the will to make a uniform European Union wide system, a European safety net, work. The answer is that all the evidence so far shows that Member States lack that will. They are they will not support a European environment inspectorate. They want to stick with national enforcement agencies. The right answer to our quandary is not to invent a huge new bureaucracy that will never spring into life. But to use our money to bring up the standards of morale of national enforcement agencies to do their job in helping to put EU law into practice. I commend to you the Amendment 129 which exempts standby generators in healthcare facilities from pollution controls. That would treat them as though they were operating 100 percent of their time. This amendment will save money at a critical time for health budgets. I commend to you the amendments on large combustion plants. Unless we get them into the directive, my country will face power blackouts. We have enough to blame the EU for without that! Final point on compromises and Mr Turmes's attack on me. The first reading is not a time for compromises. The first reading is a time when we fire off all our amendments and our ideas and discuss them. We cannot have compromises which prevent discussion. And finally, I commend to the future of this Parliament the current Rule 55, which will allow us to have a renewed first reading of this very important directive. It seems wrong to me to have the first reading in the old Parliament and only the second reading in the new one. Look at Rule 55. Thank you.
