Thank you. I would like to thank Commissioner. And I suppose... You know I don't for one minute doubt that the Commission is doing an awful lot on IT information. And what I think there're lot of you can see a lot of the work they do. And I'm a recent eh participant in the "Twitter" site and I have to say that I am more than surprised and impressed about how much eh information is on that site from the European Union. It gives a huge amount of information and I'd like to congratulate them for that. However, we still do have a problem as I said with people from disadvantaged backgrounds and elderly people using and accessing the the Internet and and new technologies. It's changing all the time, but we I think we have an opportunity, or a challenge, between now and June, when we have an election coming up. And I'd just like to ask you have you any plans to try and get more people to ehm participate ehm on the Internet and promote at the at the June elections ehm in the European Union.
