Gracias Presidente I think I'll in English in honour of our rapporteur. With this with this very interesting report, I think we the Parliament is doing three things. First of all, taking realities into consideration. We are speaking now about privacy in the era of Internet and not privacy as an abstract notion. We are taking into account the use of the Directive 1049 which has been, for some time, applied then with problems but also with good use. We are taking into account the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the proposals of the Ombudsman and of other agencies, and the case law of the Court. And we are also taking into account the real proposal of the Commission which with its possibilities but also its drawbacks. And I think there are some drawbacks. The second thing is, that this report, this is very interesting, is based on principles and not technicalities. A balance between the access to documents and the safeguard of of private life. A generalised access to documents but on very precise rules. A distinction, very important distinction between public and private interests and this notion of European public interest which to us who love Europe is is very important. A distinction between legislative and non legislative procedures which is only which is also interesting. Parity between EU transparency and Member States transparency. And lastly, the most important thing I think is that this this report tries to establish a complete system of transparency. Not transparency for every institution separately, but transparency on an interinstitutional basis where all the institutions are taken into account. Where the principles of good administration are also taken into account and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. And also this very important common set of classified information, albeit with spy movie names as EU Confidential, EU Top Secret. But it's important to have a common set of eh of rules also in this in this matter. So what we are trying to achieve here is to have of course transparency as a general rule. Of course with exceptions where those exceptions are justified by the protection of other rights. But to hov to have a common set of rules whereby transparency is the most important one but other exceptions are also taken into account. Thank you.
