Thank you President. Well, colleagues will receive an e mail from me on Monday describing my experiences during an informal visit to Cairo last weekend. It was a privilege to be there as Vice President for Democracy and Human Rights. And Mr Kasoulides referred to the role of young people in the recent revolution in Kairo in Egypt. He is absolutely right. They played a fundamental role. But eh I spoke just a few moments ago to one of them one of the organisers and said, "Are you still optimistic?" He said, "Of course I am. Things are going in the right direction." But there are problems. The timetable for elections is wrong, the timetable for reforming the Constitution is far too short. We need much more time. Mr President we're talking about Egypt, but this process is spreading. It is like 1989 and the European Union needs special procedures. This House, the Commission, the Council, EAS and we welcome Cathy Ashton's down payment for democracy, but we need to do more. We need to re reward reform. And as I said in Cairo on Sunday, and I hope to be saying it among other peoples: "I am not here as a Briton or as a European, I'm here as an honorary Egyptian." I still am. Thank you.
