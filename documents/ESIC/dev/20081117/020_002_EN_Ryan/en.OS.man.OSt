Thank you President.
One of the key elements of the EU White Paper on Sport is the elimination of racism, particularly at football matches.
And unfortunately racism has raised its ugly head at the Scottish Football League and all very much regret that.
Some players who have declared to play for Ireland have been subjected to racist abuse and also to the singing of the "Famine Song," which is a huge insult, not only to the players, but to Irish people.
I welcome the fact that the Scottish FA are taking action on this and also John Reid who's the former British Home Secretary.
But racism cannot be tolerated no matter where raises its ugly head.
And I believe we all have to stand up and say that this is completely unacceptable and cannot happen no matter where it takes place.
Thank you.
