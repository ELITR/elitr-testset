Thank you Chairman. First of all I would like to congratulate Madam Berès and Mr Langen for the work that they have put into this very important report. Ehm It is an excellent report and one that should be taken notice of. When this topic was first reported at committee level, we were experiencing a very diff difficult different economic climate. The subcrise subprime crisis in the United States of America had emerged. But I don't think anyone foresaw the repercussions and the extent of of the effect it was going to have on financial markets right across the world. As the financial situation has worsened, the tone of our debates here in ICON Committee have changed. The current crisis is a global one, and to get through it we need a coordinated global response. And I very much welcome the initiative that was taken at the weekend and the outcome of that. And I think there's a lot of more work needs to be done, however I think that is a very very good start. For Ireland, certainly the stability brought about by the euro currency, notably as regards interest rates and foreign exchange rates, is a key factor in enabling us to emerge from the tur turmoil, not unscathed, but certainly still standing. If there is still anyone in Ireland or Europe or elsewhere in the Euro Zone that doubts the benefit of e of euro membership, just look at the north west of Europe and take note of what is happening in Iceland. If if we took or if people in Ireland had listened to those who have opposed the Lisbon Treaty and also opposed the Maastricht Treaty and the Nice Treaty, where would Ireland be now? We would be outside. We would not be in the Euro Zone and we would be se ehm ehm very badly affected economically because we we wouldn't have the stability of the euro which has brought to the country. It's ve I don't expect an answer, Chairman, from the from those parties like Sinn Féin who have consistently opposed Europe and the steps we have taken. But I really believe that it's time that they stood up and said whether or not of what exactly and where do they stand on the whole issue of Europe and our economic future. Thank you.
