Thank you very much Madam President. I will start first congratulate congra congra congratulating you Miss Madam President for your contribution as the co rapporteur of our Peti Committee. Distinguished members that Mr Commissioner Vice President of the European Commission. As you may know, citizens initiative was a major priority for our S&D Group. First, I would like to congratulate all four co rapporteurs of the of the AFCO and Peti Committee for the joint work and for the remarkable delivery the succeed at. Also for the way in which they negotiated with the Council and the Commission for such a good result. I would like eh also to mention the very special role played by the Vice President of the European Commission, Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, for his readiness. For his openness, for the commitment to negotiate with both sides, the Commision the Council and the Parliament. I'm glad to vote today only few mo months after the beginning of the procedure on this unique and key instrument for the parti participative democracy in the European Union. The European Parliament had highly contribute to this text. Two third of the text it's coming from the European Parliament, showing once again its constant commitment to involvement of the European citizens in the political debate and to bring the European Union closer to them. I consider this document well balanced and contributing to our common goal. Giving the citizens initiative an important role in the practice of European democracy. And the capacity of the European citizens to impact the European policies. Indeed, this instrument is designed for creating an in depth debate through the civil society. And as our group has emphasise it from the beginning, this instrument it's accessible and simply designed. And in the meantime clear and detailed in order to avoid creating frustration. I would like to thank you very much and to wish success for this remarkable beginning. Thank you.
