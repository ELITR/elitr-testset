...Chairman, I would like to touch the issue that has been raised by many colleagues. And that's the suppression of rights of Christians. I I very much wish, in the name of consistency, that colleagues would be equally interested in in repressing the rights of of representatives of other religions. Because we are very often told by other countries that we are one sided and biased. And I think this is a question of real eh coherence and credibility. So I wish that the the guiding line of the EU human rights foreign policy woul would be avoiding any double standards. And I hope that the European Parliament will stick to that. Now, lastly, can I please ask Baroness Ashton: Are you going to respond to the many questions that we have about the new human rights structures in the EAS, as they will be put together in the very coming weeks?
