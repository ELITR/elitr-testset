Thank you Madam President. I speak as the European Parliament's Vice President for Democracy and Human Rights and thank Ms AndrikienÄ— for her excellent report. Lady Ashton in her speech eh talked about the new structures within the EEAS, or at least she didn't talk about them. I when I founded the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights many years ago, I believed it was necessary to have a structure to deliver democracy and human rights. That still exists. But Lady Ashton talks about ...the Commission wanted to abolish it and mainstream human rights and democracy through all external programmes. Now Lady Ashton doesn't talk about mainstreaming in her speech. But I fear that, when she talks about a silver thread so thin that it risks breaking at the first pressure, she is talking about a sort of filigree foreign foreign policy. And I think we need more than that. We would like to see, as others have said, right around the House, a directorate for human rights and democracy within the EEAS and, possibly, a special representative. Like Mrs eh Hautala, I was in Oslo last week and I'd like to just reflect on one single point. There were about a thousand people, I sat just behind Mrs Pelosi, united across the Atlantic: politicians, diplomats, happily united around the European Union, civil servants and NGOs. When there was a standing ovation, it was unanimous, no wave, no fragmented approach. Everybody stood up, because we stood as Western civil society behind a set of principles. So in the future, when the EU projects its soft power, it must also project principles. And we look to you, Mrs Ashton, to bring those forward. Thank you so much.
