Thank you very much Chairman.
And let me welcome the High Representative to the European Parliament today.
And I want to warmly congratulate Mrs AndrikienÄ— for her work.
Which was excellent team work, and that's why it could be adopted nearly unanimously in the Foreign Affairs Commitee.
So, I have been very fortunate to have been invited this autumn to participate in the discussions between the Member States on how the EU human rights policy could be made more effective and more coherent.
And I believe that we have now the historic moment to go for a review of our human rights policy, as you have indicated, Madam Ashton.
And my suggestion is that this process should be as inclusive as open as possible.
And I would very much recommend to you that you would give a communication in due time.
Not too late, of course, to the Parliament and to the Council, so that we can have real high-level discussion and engagement.
Now, today is very important to be reminded that the Treaty of Lisbon places the respect for human rights at the core of the Union's external policy.
And for this reason, we need to have the proper structures in place.
We know that you, the High Representative, are committed to human rights and democratic structures at headquarters.
Could we please be told what that might mean in practice?
And are you able to give us the commitment that you have given the Parliament in the summer?
I would also very much urge you to go for the decision to establish the Brussels-based COHOM, which is the working party of the Council on human rights.
Because if we need to have more coherence, which we do need, we definitely need to have this permanent structure in place.
And lastly, I would like to thank you for your efforts of bringing the Member States together last Friday in Oslo in the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.
I have reason to believe that, without your efforts, it wouldn't have happened.
And it's a very good basis for our human rights work so that the Union will have a clearer and louder and more effective voice in the world.
