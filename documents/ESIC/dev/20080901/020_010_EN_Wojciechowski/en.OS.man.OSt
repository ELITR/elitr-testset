Thank you very much Mr Chairman, ehm Commissioner, Mr Minister. I come from a country whose history is marked by war and suffering. Poland supports endeavours for peace everywhere. It is imperative that this goal be achieved. The East European countries, or the so called "Baltic States," inspired by their leaders, want the European Union to show that Russia will pay some unspecified price for its military action in Georgia. This can be depicted as a classic example of political orthodoxy which assumes that Russia pursues nothing but imperial goals. Traditional mindled mindlessness with respect to Russia, full of empty platitudes, seems to be humiliating because it can be perceived, for example by Russia, as a clinical example of some hot headed politicians. The European Union as much as it needs Georgia, needs Russia, if not more. Therefore, it is imperative that the European Union should not be a party to this conflict or to take sides with either Russia or Georgia. The European Union must show the world that its policy is independent of the United States and, at the same time, based upon a full partnership and friendly. Russia is the EU's third biggest trading partner, with half a trillion dollars in European goods. Can we afford risking that kind of relationship? There is no doubt that the European Parliament is a genuine co legislator with Council under the procedure of codecision. However, is it really an equal partner in the matter of the EU's foreign affairs? Minister, you spoke to us after all seems to have been decided on Georgia. Let me ask then: is the voice of the European Parliament supposed to mean nothing? What is this debate for when everything has been arranged and done? Thank you.
