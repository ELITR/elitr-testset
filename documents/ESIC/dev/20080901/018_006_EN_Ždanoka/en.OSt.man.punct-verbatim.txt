On behalf of the Greens Verts Group I would like to thank Mr Brejc for his great report. And we appreciate his point that consulting the VIS using the number of the visa sticker in combination with verification of fingerprints will create a lot of problems. And therefore we welcome introducing of derogation in exceptional cases consulting the VIS without verification of fingerprints. Nevertheless, in our opinion, the report is not as ambitious as it should be. The derogation must be a general eh rule instead. We suggest that the VIS is to be consulted in exceptional cases when there are doubts as regards one's identity. As it is well known that the Greens Verts strongly opposes extensive introduction of biometrics until its necessity is proven beyond reasonable doubt. We believe that it has crucial implif implications for personal data security and for fundamental rights. And therefore we can't vote in the now in favour of the regulation. Thank you. Thank you.
