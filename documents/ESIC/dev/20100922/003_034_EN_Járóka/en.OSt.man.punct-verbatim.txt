Thank you Mr President. I would like to warky warmly welcome the statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orb√°n, about launching the European Roma strategy during the upcoming Hungarian Presidency. This Parliament has been the propelling force behind developing a common European programme for Roma inclusion. And, after the announcement of the representatives of several Member States, I sincerely hope that the Council will also support the next EU Presidency in providing a common European solution for a common European problem. The primary cause behind the social exclusion of the European Roma is not mainly racism or discrimination. But the interdependence of several historical and economic factors. Therefore, the strategy must define its target audience not by ethnicity but on the basis of its common economic attributes. And must focus on alleviating geographically concentrated deep poverty distressing Roma and non Roma alike in certain disadvantaged micro regions of the European Union. This strategy must permit an EU coordinated chain of complex development programmes, based on a clear and unambiguous indicators like the Laeken indicators. With proper Community monitoring, and taking advantage of the multilevel governance. In the short run, the pan European action pas pe plan must prevent the reproduction of deep poverty through generations. And in the medium term, it is necessary to equalise the regional lack of the underdevelopment of micro regions. Slightly slower Madam, please slower. But it's OK. Keep it slower. OK. In the long run, as I said, the hopeless poverty stricken masses of today must become the equal taxpayers of tomorrow. It will require a sustained, enhanced and shared effort by all the stakeholders, the EU institutions, Member States, NGOs and also the Roma themselves. Europe cannot afford politics as usual. Not at the moment, when the demographic and the social challenges we are facing are so great and the consequences of inaction are so dangerous. We must act quickly and we must act boldly to transform our entire approach. Thank you very much.
