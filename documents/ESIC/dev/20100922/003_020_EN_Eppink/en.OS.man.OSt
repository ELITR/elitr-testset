President, I would like to ask Mr Verhofstadt to stay in the House and in the room.
The Romas is a deep-seated social problem in Europe, and I would warn for too much hypocrisy.
We have heard the sweeping statements of Mr Verhofstadt at the previous plenary session.
He accused Mr Sarkozy of things he did himself.
Mr Verhofstadt, as a prime minister in 1999, deported groups of the Romas back to Slovakia.
They were dislodged in groups.
Belgium was condemned by the European Court of Human Rights.
NGOs protested against it.
Ladies and gentlemen, the House has a right to know.
The people have a right to know, and that's why I'am saying this.
Because we have sweeping statements about everything.
That's the reason why Mr Verhofstadt is not listening.
Because he doesn't want to be reminded of it.
And that's precisely what I am doing.
And that's why I have been elected: to remind him of what he did.
And if Mr President there's ever going to be a Nobel Prize for hypocrisy, I am quite sure that Mr Verhofstadt will win it handily.
Thank you very much.
