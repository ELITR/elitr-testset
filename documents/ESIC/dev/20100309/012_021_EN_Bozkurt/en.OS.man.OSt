Roma, the largest European mino minority, are suffering from institutional discrimination, anti Gypsyism, extraordinary levels of pow poverty and social exclusion, segregated system in housing, education and social welfare. Short term solutions are not an answer to the widespread and deep rooted problems of Roma. We need to ev evaluate existing good practices, as well as the negative effect of existing policies for the Roma population. One, but not the only, example is taking Roma children away from their families and putting them in separate boarding schools. These measures do not solve problems. Rather they lead to more segregation, and impact deeply and negatively in lives of Roma families. Europe needs an ex an effective long term Roma strategy. This summit gives us a new opportunity for affirmative action, different from the first Roma Summit, that did not include real political commitments in the EU. The EU star should start by giving a good example, by offering more positions to Roma people and including Roma and civil society in the strategy. Thank you.
