Thank you Mr.
By this sheer coincidence, Transparency International, the anti-corruption watchdog, released its annual corruption perception index today.
An this is estimating that levels of corruption are adding about 50 billion USD to the cost of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which is an absolutely staggering amount of money.
It's approximately half of the annual global aid outlay.
I mean even if that figure is exaggerated even if it's half of what they're saying, it's still a staggering amount of money.
And do you not think Minister that more needs to be done to try and tackle this?
Because whatever, you know, we need, one thing we don't need is for the general public in Europe to feel that the money that they are giving to aid programmes is in some way being mislaid or being, you know, retaken away abused.
And I think it's very very important that you know something of this staggering figure needs to be addressed in a more coherent way.
Thank you
