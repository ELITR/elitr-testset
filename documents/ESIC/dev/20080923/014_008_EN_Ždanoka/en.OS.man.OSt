OK, thank you Chairman.
Dear Chairman, dear colleagues.
I would like first of all to thank Mr Coelho for his productive as usual work on the reports concerning transition to SIS II.
The reports cover mainly technical things, and I would like however to look at SIS II from a broader perspective.
First of all, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the Portuguese presidency has provided an opportunity for the 10 new Member States to join the old version of SIS.
Otherwise, the new Member States, including my own one would have to wait at least until September 2009
In other words, almost for two years more.
On the other hand, "late" does not necessarily mean "bad."
SIS II will operate under two pillars.
Nevertheless, we still do not have legally binding framework decision on data protection within the third pillar.
As SIS II introduces processing biometric data, the issue of data protection remains largely unresolved.
I would like to stress that my political group is extremely cautious in what concerns biometrics.
Maybe we really have to wait for a solid legal background for data protection because we start using SIS II.
Another field where operation of SIS might be useful is entry bans introduced by the Member States for third-country nationals.
According to the Schengen Convention, national law is applicable when one seeks deletion of alert concerning him or her.
In this respect, regulation on SIS II provides for better procedural guarantees at the European level.
To sum up, in some fields SIS II gives us better Europe.
Nevertheless, we have to continue working on various significant flaws.
If we have to wait in order to get more guarantees, maybe we must be ready to wait.
Thank you.
