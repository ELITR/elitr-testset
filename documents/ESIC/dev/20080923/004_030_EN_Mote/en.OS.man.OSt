Two weeks ago the Chairman of the Muslim Council of Great Britain addressed a meeting in this building, when he categorically rejected reciprocity between faiths. He demanded that the indigenous population had an obligation to welcome newcomers, and that those newcomers had a right to remain separate. He made no reference whatsoever to weeding out the Islamic fundamentalists in his own community, despite knowing, as he must, that Muslims, and only Muslims, have the knowledge to find and stop their fanatics. It was not Scottish rugby players who blew up the tube trains in London, nor Welsh farmers, nor even English cricketers. It was a bunch of brainwashed Muslim youngsters who were looking for 72 vestal virgins in Paradise, believing that they had a God given right to slaughter non believers. We are not fighting terrorism. We are fighting a war of religion, and it is about time we faced up to that distinction.
