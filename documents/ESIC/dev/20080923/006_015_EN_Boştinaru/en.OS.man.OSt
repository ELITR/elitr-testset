Thank you very much Miss Miss Madam President. Today's vote was an important moment for the citizens fighting for their their rights, their European rights. National governments at times abandon their citizens and reject their legitimate claims. Through petitions European citizens can raise their voice, can hold their government accountable. Ultimately they can have the justice they deserve. But this is not an important moment only for the European people. It is crucial time for the European Parliament too. Today the European Parliament, by voting in favour of the Hammerstein report, shows its commitment to defend and to protect European citizens. Today the European Parliament has the opportunity to regain at least part of the confidence and trust some in Europe have lost. Many of our fellow citizens have worked hard to be in the EU, but membership is not only about duties. It's also about rights. And we are here today to show our commitment for the Europe our citizens expect from us. Thank you very much.
