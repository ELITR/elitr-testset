Thank you.
I wish to thank everyone who have been working really hard on the seemingly never-ending story of SIS II Mr Coelho and those in the field.
The issue of reoccurring delays and cost overruns is very worrying and, if not this, what else could be more telling about Mr Barroso's management skills in his first Commission?
I believe we should take these lessons which can be learnt here today and project them in the creation of a new IT agency, which could be situated in Tallinn.
Which would be a win-win situation: while the French colleagues could keep the servers in Strasbourg and the new programming work would be done in Tallinn by competent specialists with low management costs.
With avoiding the monopoly and embracing the idea of EU integration, also will guarantee of data protection.
Finally, I'd like to express my confidence in Madam Malmstr√∂m's ability to resolve these complicated issues.
And thank you.
