...you eh I'll also speak on Schengen Information System, honourable President, honourable Commissioner, dear colleagues. First of all, of course, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work. And I would like to stress that my group, from the very beginning, was quite cautious to accept SIS II, due to many implications concerning data protection. Now it seems that the long SIS II se saga is far from being finished. We see time delays and cost overruns, we don 't have any positive results. We even don't have a consensus about evaluation of test results. As Austria, Germany and France don't see them as successful. In our opinion, the approach taken by the rapporteur is absolutely right. We have to be ho honest and admit that the current project might fail, and we have to discuss the alternatives. We should also investigate carefully the reasons behind this failure. If we need to invest 30 millions euro more, the Parliament should have all the information necessary for informed consent. We must also maintain an sunset clause. We cannot continue investing money into a lifelong project. Of course, certain flexibility should be there, but we must have clear criteria for evaluation and to react quickly if, again, something goes wrong. Thank you.
