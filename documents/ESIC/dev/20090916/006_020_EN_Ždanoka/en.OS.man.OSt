Thank you d Chairman. As an MEP elected in Latvia, I do welcome that the first example of a strategy for a macroregion is targeting the Baltic Sea area. Nevertheless, in my opinion, a number of Community objectives have been forgotten here. For instance, a high level of social protection. Some of the region's Member States, including Latvia, are severely hit by the economic crisis. Our financial sector is interconnected with the Scandinavian one. It means that our problems will create problems there, so this is not a national issue. Recently, Latvia have received medium term financial assistance for balance of payments, provided for by the Commission. Unfortunately, there are no social conditions for such assistance. As a result, the government is reducing pensions and benefits, but the Commission tolerates this. My second concern is about fundamental rights. Mass statelessness and minority protection is still a topical issue in two of the region's Member States: Latvia and Estonia. And so I can the I think that the strategy must be more ambitious to raise all the objectives of the European Union. Thank you.
