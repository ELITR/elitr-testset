... you very much Mr President, Mrs Minister, Mr Commissioner. I welcome the idea of a strategy for the Black Sea region as a pilot project for the macro regional strategies. Initiatives of this kind allow the coordination of EU policy instruments in order to have a coherent, stable and sustainable development of the regions involved. On the occasion of the last Council, it was said that a strategy would have been developed for the Black Sea region by the end of 2009. This is an extremely important initiative as it can bring along harmonised development and prosperity for the region that, in comparison with the Bla Black Sea area, it's far more complex in terms of actor involved and relevance for the security, stability, energy and the environment. So I would like therefore to ask the Swedish Presidency. When such a strategy for the Black Sea region will be delivered? And when the European Parliament will be informed and involved in this issue? Thank you very much.
