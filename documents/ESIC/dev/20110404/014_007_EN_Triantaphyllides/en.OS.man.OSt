I'm very pleased Mr President to be having this debate today, in a view of the vote on Wednesday.
Hopefully, our work will shake Council out of its inertia and trigger productive negotiations, allowing us to fulfil our objective of having a common European asylum system by 2012
Thus taking into consideration the hard work we have all put into this file.
And nowing this I would like to warmly thank Mrs Guillaume for her excellent work and her conciliatory approach.
The result is on the whole a good text including significant improvements with respect to the asylum procedures currently implemented in the EU, which vary enormously from Member State to Member State.
To name but a few, new provisions have introduced to ensure each applicant is provided with adequate means to substantiate his or her claims in order to reach an asylum decision within a six-month period.
Such as the personal interview and free advice on procedural and legal aspects in first- instance procedures, including the preparation of the necessary procedural documents.
Thank you President.
