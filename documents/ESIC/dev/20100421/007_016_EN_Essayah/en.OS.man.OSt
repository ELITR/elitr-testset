Thank you Mr Chairman. I agree that one should not create such tailing dams which cause the accident in Baia Mare in the year 2000. Finland is a big gold producer in European standards. The new mine in Kittilä is the biggest in Europe with a yearly production of 5000 kg of gold. Now we have to remember one scientical scientifical fact. Gold does not dissolve in other liquids than cyanide. Therefore, the extraction process in Kittilä also involves cyanide, but in closed processes. Cyanide used in processing the enriched slurry is reused and the residuals of cyanide are destroyed after the process. Even the residuals of cyanide in the water recovered from tailings dams are purified. Bacteria based extraction would be more nature friendly, but it is not yet used for gold. The first mine in the world to use microbial extraction from heaps of nickel ore is in Talvivaara, Finland as well. Microbial purification of residual cyanide is being developed with good results and I strongly recommend moving in that direction. Therefore, I don't support an intention to ban the use of cyanide totally. But I would surely encourage strict environmental controls with best available technology and closed processes.
