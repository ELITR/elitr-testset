... you Mr President.
With all due respect, can I remark that this debate is largely misdirected.
Let me notice that the matter that stands before us is a very curious object.
It reignites an accident that took place 10 years ago.
Why?
Why is this long silence?
And why now?
Why a debate now?
If we follow this pattern, we could and we should ban anything and everything that can be linked to a past accident.
I find the whole matter unjustified.
And I think it uses environment as a paravan and it counts on the mass fears so fashionable nowadays.
In my opinion, and I think in truth, it is just a poor political plot.
Thank you very much.
