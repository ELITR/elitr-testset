Thank you very much, Chair. High Representative Ashton, you have very clearly heard this morning that the Parliament will fully support your leadership role. And is demanding and asking that you take the initiative in in our common foreign and security policy. Now you have also heard the many questions by colleagues about who and which Member States are blocking our common efforts. My suggestion to you would be that, now that the European External Action Service is putting in place its rules on access to information, access to documents. Please make this a modern organisation which is accessible to citizens. Which doesn't deal with foreign policy as if it would be only the domain of some secretive diplomats. I'm sure this would be the best way to boost our common efforts for a truly common foreign and security policy.
