Well I know I know this kind of argument, you know if you criticise a government, you criticise its people. This is the way I know it also from from former times in my own country too. Be clear. It was not us who started the debate. It was the Hungarian Government with this, I said here, contested law. This is very much disputed by many Hungarian citizens. Many Hungarian citizens who suffered in Communism. Who suffered those in the Nazi regime. They are afraid that their expression the liberty of expression is in danger. And that is the element that you should take care of. Thank you very much.
