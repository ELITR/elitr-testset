...you very much Mrs President, Mr Commissioner
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia represents another important step in the process of integration towards the EU undertaken by Serbia.
We are talking about a country whose progress in the recent years has already been impressive.
And I think that further political and economic integration on the basis of the SAA will give the final boost to Serbia EU path.
But considering the important role Serbia plays in the Western Balkans, the SAA will have a positive influence not only on the EU and Serbia as such.
But also on the whole region by facilitating its security, stability and development, as well as posing solid foundation for the enlargement process in the Western Balkans.
I hope that, after it the green light of the European Parliament, the SAA agreement process can be concluded as soon as possible.
I would therefore ask the Member States to ensure that the ratification process can run in the smoothest and rapid manner.
Thank you very much.
