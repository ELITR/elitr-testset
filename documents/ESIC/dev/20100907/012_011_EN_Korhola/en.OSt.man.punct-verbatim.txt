Thank you Madam President. At first I would like to convey my sympathy to the people of Pakistan over the tragic loss of lives. I would also like to thank Commissioner Georgieva for her devoted work in making Pakistan an urgent priority on her agenda. It took the world and the EU some time to comprehend the full scale of the disaster. Now, as we understand better the needs of the affected people, our response should be urgent and match match those needs. We need to provide more financial and material assistance while ensuring that help will will reach everyone, including minorities, according to their needs. We must also not forget that Pakistan is a frontline country against international war on extre extremism and terrorism. If we fail to assist them, poverty and despair may strengthen militanty militancy. One time humani humanitarian assistance will not do. It should be combined with help to rebuild the country's infrastructure roads, bridges, schools, etc. We also need to take urgent measures to help Pakistan in reviving its economy and trade. Enhanced market access for Pakistani exports and new debt arrangements could turn the tide. EU Member States should seriously reconsider debt trade off as a way to iffer offer help in this tragedy. Thank you.
