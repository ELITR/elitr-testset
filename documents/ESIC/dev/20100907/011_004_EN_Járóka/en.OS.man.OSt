...much Mr President. I'm glad that the EU institutions appear so sensitive for the plight of the Roma today. For that very reason, it is a pity that the policy makers of all sides of the political spectrum seem to use the Roma issue as a weapon against their counterparts. We all agree that freedom of movement is one of the fundamental principles of Community law, and accept that this right is not unconditional. As the Commission has confirmed, all EU countries have the right to take security measures regarding foreigners residing on their territory. The core values of the Euro European Union, such as the non discrimination, tolerance and solidarity, must be fully respected. And the expulsion of any EU citizens must be implemented on the case by case basis on the grounds of proper proper judicial decisions. Or with free, complete and informed consent of all the individuals concerned. To quote the Commission again, "nobody should face expulsion just for being a Roma." Political opinions and legal judgments are separate issues. We might find that expulsions dis distasteful or far fetched. And we must draw the attention to the safeguards and principles to be acted upon. But judging the legitimacy of the French measures is the sole responsibility of the Commission. Large scale repatriations might be repulsive. But even more repulsive when the empty human rights lip service of the last decades when technically, nothing has been done to alleviate the terrible poverty of Roma. Except for chanting of a few cold words about anti discrimination and tolerance when it became politically handy. We, the European Roma, refuse the political misuse and misinterpretation of our issues. Roma must set the discourse about themselves to reveal the problems and articulate what actions and measures has to be taken. As proclaimed several times by this Parliament, and more specifically by the European People's Party, the poverty and the social exclusion of the Roma is a European issue and requi requires a strategy of its own. A common European solution needed for a common European problem. This strategy must tackle the economic features of socially excluded Roma and equally non Roma Such as structural unemployment, low qualifications, dwelling in seriously disadvantaged micro regions and barriers to self employment. All the issues which our people escaping from when they migrate. Thank you Madam. Thank you.
