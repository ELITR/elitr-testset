Honourable President, Commissioner, colleagues. Our political group supports the visa facilitation agreement between EU and Georgia. But preserves reservations on the agreement on readmission. We voted against it in the Liber Committee and submitted our written minority opinion. Because the agreement contains numerous ambiguities which might be clarified in the Joint Readmission Committee. It does not include strict safeguards concerning the violation of fundamental rights and guaranteeing high standards on of reception, which are poor in Georgia. It aims at returning people to a country where sexual and gender based violence is rife and police ill treatment tolerated. It applies also to those former residents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia who do not have any de facto links to Georgia. And now some few words on visa agreement with Russia. Three years ago, when the report on visa facilitation with Russia passed, my own amendment saying that the requirement of the mandatory registration procedure is a serious obstacle to travel within Russia and the EU was adopted. Unfortunately, nothing has been changed since that time and this is crucially important for my electorate who travel to Russia for private visits. Thank you.
