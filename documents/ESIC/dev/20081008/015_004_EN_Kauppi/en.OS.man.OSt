Thank you Mr Speaker, thank you Mr Commissioner. I think it was Mrs Tumpel Gugerell who said in Nice in mid September that the worst mistake we have done was that we didn't include the financial supervisory architecture into the Maastricht Treaty. We should have dealt eh this eh issue already, together with the EMU final phase decisions. I completely agree with e with this view, and it's a Mrs Tumpel Gugerell is definitely not the only one who has said this. But who are we to blame on the lack of progress on supervisory architecture? I don't think that is the Community soldiers we need to blame. And I mean by Community soldiers are the European Commission, whis which has delivered, and also the European Parliament. Like Mrs van den Burg said, we have dealt with this issue already since the beginning of 2000. And we have made several proposals to the Council, but Council seems totally reluctant to move. I still wonder how it was possible to eh have the Lamfalussy regime in place. Maybe it was the the deal between UK and Germany to offer CESR location to Paris which finally made it. But I think that in in Council they have been totally unwilling to move forward on this issue. So now it's the right time and maybe it's too le too limited and too late. But at least something is now done also in the Council. The European Parliament has made eh several very important eh eh eeeh important proposals. I would say in priority order, that these three are the most important ones. First, the mandatory colleges to all cross border financial institutions, with legally binding rules on how they operate. How they share information and what kind of decision making procedures they use. Second, improved legal status of the Level 3 Committees, and more effective working methods also for them. Maybe in this issue, Commission could li give a little bit more room for manoeuvre to Level 3. That it's not only eh eh consultative body but they should be also decision making bodies in the future. And third, strengthening the role of the ECB in financial stability. ECB should get more information. It should be linked to the CESR and cips CEOPS and they should work more together. Finally I want to say something about the transatlantic dialogue. Now it's not the good time to put the transatlantic financial services on hold. I know this is not the fault of the Commission but this is mainly depending now on the US actions. But I think that the more you can do to keep that discussion going, the more eh the the better it is. It's very important for the future... Thank you.
