... would go all in relation to many other issues that are going on in the Parliament. We are discussing the poorest of the poor, the European Roma, and we are all facing with the new Hungarian Presidency European Roma strategy. And agriculture is very very rarely addressed in inter sectoral issues when it comes to the poorest of the poor. And eh especially because no lands are earned by the poorest of the poor in Europe. And in this sense it's not only about about the food security but having the food on the table. As one of my other colleagues has already said, is an is an essential question of the EU today. So I believe that the agricultural sector and the Commission working out these documents has to be in line with all the other micro regional development projects of the EU. Which are trying to fight poverty and secure food on the table of the future generation. Thank you very much.
