Gracias Presidente
Dear colleagues this is a very important decision that we are about to take.
And I think that the Socialist Group is in favour of postponement for four reasons of principle.
The first one is the credibility and the role of our own Parliament.
It is very important to say, from the outset, what the Parliament can and what the Parliament cannot do.
And what it can and must do is control democratically the accounts of also the Council.
Notwithstanding this gentlemen's agreement that has been in place.
The second reason is the interinstitutional equilibrium.
It's important that we do not do something that we cannot do as a Parliament.
But it's also very important to say that it is in our right to have a view.
To have a mind in the accounts of the Council.
When these accounts are operational and where these operational accounts must be accounted for.
This is the democratic principle and this is what we are about to do.
So we are not saying we want to do something else.
We are saying we want to do our duty.
The third reason is the respect and the preparation of the Treaty of Lisbon.
You know very well, colleagues, that, with the Treaty of Lisbon, the common external policy acquires much more depth, much more momentum.
It's a much more important common policy and we cannot from the outset say that the Parliament will not have a bearing on that policy at all.
We must have now the opportunity to say what the role of the Parliament is.
And the last, and probably the most important point is transparency vis-à-vis the citizens.
Our role as a Parliament is accountability vis-à-vis the citizens.
We cannot, and we must not, say to the citizens that the big common policy, like the external and defence policy, will lie outside the democratic control of our Parliament.
So for those four important reasons of principle, we think that we must vote in favour of postponement.
Thank you.
