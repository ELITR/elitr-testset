... to congratulate Mr Skinner on this report.
I think he's done an excellent job.
It's been a huge undertaking but I think he has really delivered on this very very complex piece of legislation.
Also to the European institutions and Member States, who have brought us this successful conclusion of Solvency II.
I think it's good example of how Europe must work together towards financial recovery.
And burdens will be shared, as will solutions.
This European approved response is a good example of a closer relationship on financial cooperation.
I think we have to work to make sure that there is never again a banking crisis like the one we are going through at the moment.
I did notice with great interest the Commission's approval of a mortgage support scheme for UK homeowners.
This scheme will allow householders who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments to defer all their principal and up to 70 percent of their interest payments for a period of two years.
We should carefully follow the progress of this scheme and learn from and implement any effective measures that would ease the burden we carry.
I think it's something that all Member States can look at, but also I think that financial institutions in Member States themselves could make it easier for people to move to interest-only mortgages if they found themselves in difficulty.
And I think that the financial institutions, considering the support that they have from Member State governments, could do a lot to help people who are...

Thank you.
