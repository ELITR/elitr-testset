Yes, like Mr Nassauer has already said, PPE-DE Group is very happy about the contents of the annual legislative programme.
I think it's because the improved process, that now Parliament has been already on board in a process.
And that makes it very easy for us to improve the annual legislative programme.
As a representative of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, I would like to concentrate on your first pillar - growth, jobs and competitiveness of Europe.
I think that the key is of course how we respond to the financial crisis.
In the PPE-DE Group we think that, financial crisis is...
We have already quite a good legislation in place in Europe, so everything what we do now should be based on the existing legislation and improving it.
We don't see the need for very radical overhaul of things in Europe.
We think that, first of all, soft-law measures should be considered because that is also most effective way to respond to global issues.
Financial markets are very global and we can't act in Europe like we would be in a vacuum.
We also think that there are many improvements in the present regulatory and supervisory framework.
The so-called "Lamfalussy Framework," and we completely support the work of the Commission on that area.
The second issue is climate change.
Climate change will influence growth and jobs in Europe.
We shouldn't take these fundamentalist view about climate change that Europe must act now and must do everything at once without the support of the global scale.
Thirty percent of emissions, even if we would go to that.
That's not enough to tackle the climate change.
We need a global, effective deal and that probably is coming from Copenhagen.
Before that we shouldn't punish ourselves.
We shouldn't punish European competitiveness too much, but we should take a realistic approach to climate change policies in Europe.
And finally, the third thing, SMEs.
SMEs are the key to European growth.
And for example, the social package we should always take on board their views and how they see the social framework environment in Europe.
And social package should not be a burden to European middle-sized and small companies.
