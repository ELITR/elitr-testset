Thank you Mr President.
The whole climate change programme has given EU yet another excuse to flex its muscles and show the world how important it is.
Claiming that this is an issue that nation states cannot deal with alone.
The 20 20 20 slogan is a typical example of a catchy phrase to work with.
Twenty percent of energy in the EU from renewable sources, a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions, all by the year 2020.
But you are missing the most important point.
Is any of this necessary?
We were told recently by the IPCC that 2500 scientists were all in agreement that CO 2 was responsible for global warming and that we humans were the culprits.
Al Gore's infamous film confirmed that view.
However, since then over 30000 scientists and climatologists have signed the Oregon Petition and the Manhattan Declaration which directly challenges the IPCC conclusions with some very compelling evidence.
So whilst we are urged to believe the IPCC's 2500 scientists, we've being told to completely ignore the 30000 scientists who are painting a different picture.
The EU is persuading nations across the world to spend billions of taxpayers' money, at the very time when the world is facing dire financial problems, on something that might not only be totally unnecessary.
But could well prove to be counter-productive if the latest evidence of global cooling proves to be correct.
We must have a full and open debate to prove exactly who is right.
What do supporters of the IPCC's position have to fear?
You will no doubt be pleased to hear that this will be my very last speech in this Parliament since I retire after this session.
Thank you.
