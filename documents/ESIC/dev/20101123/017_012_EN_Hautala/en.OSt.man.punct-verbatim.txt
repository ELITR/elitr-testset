Thank you very much Chair. Awarding the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo testifies to the personal cost of human rights advocacy in China today. This is imperative that he and all other human rights defenders in China be released immediately. There are other pending cases. I remain painfully aware of the situation of Dhondup Wangchen, the Tibetan film maker, who suffers from hepatitis B and is in need of urgent medical attention in the prison. In particular, the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Xiaobo must be considered as a strong support for the struggle for the freedom of expression in China. It however also serves as a reminder to the international community on the need for reform in China. Even Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, has warned that China may lose what it has already achieved through economic restructuring. If there is not going to be a consequent political restructuring. And, colleagues, he was censured by the Chinese media. Delay in such reform has a terrible human cost. Besides, pressuring of the countries to stay away from the Peace Prize ceremony shows that China has not yet matured into an international actor. China is a superpower and it should start acting like one responsibly. And Chairman, I am very humbled to say that I've been invited to the ceremony as one of the 50 persons who are going to represent Liu Xiaobo at that ceremony.
