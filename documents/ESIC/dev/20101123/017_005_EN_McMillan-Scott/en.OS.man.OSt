Thank you Madam President.
This debate in a sense catalyses several years of effort by many Members who are present here, and others, to try and focus attention on the real China.
It's encouraging the sense of unity being displayed by Council and
Commission, and by the diplomatic representatives in Oslo, concerning the ceremony which may take place on 10 December.
Of course we hope that Liu Xiaobo will be present, but it is unlikely.
What we've seen in the last few weeks, in diplomatic terms, is a car crash organised by Beijing.
It is one of the most disastrous, cack-handed episodes in the history of diplomacy.
But at the heart of this lies the clash between the free world and what remains a dictatorship.
On my last occasion in Beijing, all the people with whom I had contact were subsequently arrested, imprisoned and, in some cases, tortured.
There are between seven and eight million people imprisoned across China, at least 5000 executions a year.
And I've seen a list of more than 3400 people who, in the last 10 years, have died under torture in that regime for their religious convictions.
In sum, this is a terror state.
So we want to congratulate the Nobel Peace Prize Committee for its courage in making this award.
And I hope that in Oslo, on 10 December should the ceremony take place, we have the most muscular presence on behalf of the European Union, standing by its foreign policy priorities of human rights and democracy.
The world's most populous country deserves what we enjoy in Europe.
Thank you very much.
