Murder of prisoners of war and of civilians captured during wartime constitutes one of the most severe violations of international law.
The third and fourth Geneva Conventions state clearly that such acts fall far below the standards of international legality and render the actor responsible liable in the eyes of the international community.
It is in this same spirit that Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights declares the taking of life a flagrant violation.
The recent confession of the Turkish actor Attila Olga√ß for the murder of 10 Greek Cypriot captives during the Turkish invasion in Cyprus in the summer of 74 unmasks for once more the crimes committed by Turkey.
And renders the opening its archives for the investigation of the fate of all the missing persons and an inescapable responsibility
The international community, of which the European Union is a significant actor, must put all possible pressure on Turkey to comply with international law, the related decisions of the Strasbourgh Court as well as all relevant UN resolutions.
Thank you.
