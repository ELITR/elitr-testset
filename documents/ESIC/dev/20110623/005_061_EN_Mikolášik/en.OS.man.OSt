Dear colleagues, Mr Commissioner.
The implementation of the programmes is a continuous and dynamic process that can be influenced by means of identifying frequent shortcomings in the whole process and areas where reforms are needed.
In this context, strategic reporting, as a new instrument, increases the accountability in delivering policy objectives and shows that the cohesion policy should address all European regions and societal challenges to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the whole EU.
The cohesion policy relies upon good governance at European, national, regional and local level.
Smooth cooperation of all these levels is as highly desirable as the simplification of the whole process.
The funds must not remain unused due to the superfluous bureaucracy or onerous rules and procedures, of course.
The well-financed cohesion policy should be closer to the EU citizens and should continue to address all European Union regions and societal challenges.
Both helping the poorer to catch and delivering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the whole European Union.
The strategic report 2010 constitutes a strong incentive to improve the current implementation of the cohesion policy programmes.
It also encourages the Member States to correct the delays in investing the EU funds and to develop more efficient action plans to deliver agreed results.
Therefore, I hope Ladies and Gentlemen that today's result of our vote on the strategic report 2010 will send this message to the Member States and the Commission.
Thank you very much.
