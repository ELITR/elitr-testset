And let me turn into English.
First of all I would like to thank all for your interesting inputs and especially all the shadows for their excellent cooperation.
There were many inspiring and relevant ideas expressed in amendments, as well as in opinions.
So I devoted special attention to create a well-balanced approach that would capture their essence and variety to the largest possible extent.
Strategic reporting represents a new feature of cohesion policy, introduced in the present programming period 2007-2013.
With the strategic report 2010, the European Parliament has first occasion for analysis and evaluation on the outputs and results of cohesion policy implementation.
This is also an opportunity to express Parliament's opinion on Member State spending priorities, highlight areas where more efforts are needed, including the Commission's tackling of the implementation and the strategic reporting itself.
The 2010 strategic report is mainly focused on the implementation of programmes during the current programming period and the strategic reporting exercise.
However, it also provides several valuable insights into the future of cohesion policy.
Firstly, is to the implementation of the programmes, the reported financial volume of the selected projects is 93.4 billion euro, representing more than 27 percent of available EU resources in this period.
This can be considered rather reasonable, given the context of serious deterioration in the socio-economic situation in 2008-2009 due to the global crisis, but also the reform made to the policy for the period 2007-2013.
Nevertheless, the progress varies significantly between countries and across themes, with aggregate selection rates about 40 percent in the case of nine Member States and below 20 percent for four Member States.
It is clear that European regions are still facing striking economic, social and environmental disparities.
On the other hand, this average rate of project selection is closely respected in three objectives.
Convergence, regional competitiveness and employment and European territorial cooperation.
And equally applies to the rate of selection of the Lisbon categories.
The higher absorption of the environmental programmes under the European territorial cooperation programmes shows an added value of cross-border and interregional cooperation.
And as such it should be encouraged in future.
On the other hand, more efforts are needed in certain areas, especially to strengthen the performance of the implementation, avoid excessive delays, ensure tighter financial discipline and to increase synergies with other EU policies.
Secondly, as to the strategic reporting itself.
Strategic reporting is a tool for reflecting strategically, and discussing, thematic dimension of cohesion policy based on concrete evidence provided by Member States.
The strategic reporting is also the evaluation of the ongoing process.
It is carried out during the programming period with the view to provide an overview of the progress of the Member State in delivering the EU's goals, and to provide a useful basis to improve performance.
Therefore the report highlights many good practices that can contribute to the enhance quality of the reporting exercise, increase ownership of stakeholders within Member States, and in the end improve efficiency of implementation.
I conclude Mr President I would like just to mention that just one of the many good practices, which is use of core indicators by all the Member States.
Thank you very much.
