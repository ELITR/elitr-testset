Dear President, dear members. The volume of complaints regarding misleding misleading directory companies shows that this is a serious problem for SMEs. Rogue business directory companies are inflicting both financial dama damage and harassing small companies. In the period 2003 to mid 2008, nearly 14000 complaints and enquiries were documented. Hundreds of letters of complaint are still being received from new victims. The difficulties involved in tracking down activities of this nature undermine the very functioning of the Internal Market. Misleading practices are illegal under the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive and Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. But there is a lack of effective legal remedies and enforcement. The INCO Committee, as the committee responsible for the legi legislation, has recently taken up this issue with the Dutch authorities, drawing their attention to fraudulent practices by business directory company established in the Netherlands. The answer of the Dutch authorities clearly shows that Member States are mostly concerned about what happens in their own territory. I believe that given the cross border nature of the problem, more coop cooperation between Member States on enforcement would also be absolutely crucial to stop the fro fraudulent practices. The Commission could itself take a more active role in working together with the Member States on cross border enforcement using existing EU wide networks to facilitate cooperation between the Member States. More emphasis should be on effective and dissuasive sanctions for such fraudulent practices in all Member States. Which would put directory companies out of the business and enable those who run them to be punished. It should be envisaged to extend the scope of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive so as to en encompass all commercial practices in a business to consumer relationship. Whether aiming at the protection of consumers or competitors. In that way, most if not all business to business unfair commercial practices in the retail sector would be covered and governed by the same set of rules as business to consumer unfair commercial practices, with which they generally coincide. It is important to help businesses to combat the scam also by improving access to information and awareness raising by improving redress mechanisms. I wish to ask the Commissioner: what are the major obta obstacles for stronger engagement of state authorities in cross border enforcement cooperation. And which measures does the Commission envisage in the fight against rogue directory companies? Thank you.
