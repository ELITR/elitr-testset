The Commissioner informed us just before the vote on the thrombin issue.
And I wonder if you could ask him to provide the statistical data to justify his statement that it's economically beneficial to consumers.
Because replacing cheap meat parts and put them in beef-similar structures, rather than using them today in sausages and other products.
I would like him to show the statistical evidence that it's economically better for consumers, because they have so far not proven that.
And also the Commissioner made a comparison with minced meat but we know that the hygiene standards for minced meat are not the same as for prepared meat products.
So both of the statements of the Commissioner I would actually question if they are correct.
And then by if he misinformed the Parliament, just before the vote, that would be a serious error.
So I'd like you to ask him, you to write a letter to the Commissioner to justify those statements.
Thank you.
