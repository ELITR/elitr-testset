Thank you very much President.
The President just asked: is there an exit strategy from this crisis?
And I would say yes, there is.
It's called fiscal conservatism.
The structural problem of ours has been that the public overspending was due on too long.
The public sector was out of control for during many years.
Even in good times, the German Government of Mr Schröder went through the 3% ceiling.
And Greece, of course, struck all records, because the Greek political class is utterly unable to manage money.
Now we had the Stability Pact.
What did Mr Prodi say about the Stability Pact in 2002?
You know it.
You were head of cabinet of Mr Liikanen.
He said the Stability Pact was stupid.
So we had to change it.
It was the guardian of the treaties.
We did change it, and we put it on the slippery slope and we see the results today.
The EU will be faced with a track of fiscal conservatism for many years to come.
And that's going to be very important.
What we need is innovation, is more free markets and is more entrepreneurial skills, Mr Schulz.
Do we need taxation, Mr President from Spain?
No, it makes it makes things even worse.
It pushes the EU in stagnation, and you're going to be the Robin Hood in reverse.
So I would say and I understand the anger of the people.
The people with pensions, the people with savings.
I understand the German taxpayers.
They know that they will have to pay, but German taxpayers cannot always pay.
And I find it a bit pretentious of Mr Verhofstadt if he's still there to tell Mrs Merkel to shut up talk about the euro.
This was said by a former government leader who messed up his own country.
So what is he trying to prove?
