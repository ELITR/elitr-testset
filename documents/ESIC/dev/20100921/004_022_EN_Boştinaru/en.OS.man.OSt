Madam President, dear colleagues, MR Commissioner.
I have always said and I am repeated once again today, that the relations between EU and China are of extreme importance for both sides and for the whole world too.
And this has become even more true today, with the China continuing with its fast growth and the EU still struggling with the crisis.
The EU needs China and China needs the EU.
Until now, no real strategic agreement have been reached by the EU with Beijing.
And my hope is that the forthcoming summit will finally be the right opportunity for us to speak one single voice and to give a strategic approach to our relations with China.
And Mr Commissioner, because the agenda it's so close and so important.
Were the strategic partnership ist the most needed for this fall and for the next spring.
First, is the G20, where Europe and China need to build up a strong and effective partnership.
Number two, Canc√∫n who has the lessons drawn from the EU failure on climate change in Copenhagen.
And number three, international aid and development and these not only for Africa.
And so together to make out of the Millennium Development Goal reality, rather than just a holy promise.
Thank you.
