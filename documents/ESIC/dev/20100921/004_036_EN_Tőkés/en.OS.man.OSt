Thank you Mrs President.
As we know, the EU is China's largest trade partner enjoying our support in their economic reforms.
But let us not forget that these reforms cannot move forward without reforms in the field of respect for human rights.
Europe successfully put an end to its nearly 50-year experience with Communist totalitarianism that deprived people of their identities, distorting the natural course of so many lives.
Therefore, in dialogues with China, as well as in the upcoming summit, we must continuously focus on the Communist China's failures to respect human rights.
Our statements must reflect a stronger and more defined common position in order to provide a meaningful engagement on the issues such as freedom of the press and religion, discrimination of ethnic minorities, the issue of Tibet, the Uighurs, the death penalty.
I therefore ask the EU representatives ensure a better integration of human rights issues in EU- China relations.
