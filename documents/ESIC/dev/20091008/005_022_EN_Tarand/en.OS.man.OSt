Thank you, that's an interesting question and takes historical research: have the centre left governments done anything about it? But in my speech, I pointed out that the centre left party is doing the same what Mr Berlusconi is doing in Italy. So the debate is about Europe, about freedom of speech not and about threats coming to freedom of speech whatever side, it is left or right. That's my opinion. Thank you.
