In my opinion, freedom of the press in a country can only be properly assessed considering every aspect of the question. Including a thorough analysis of the markets, including advertisement markets, and the habits of the population, like average time spent watching TV, spread of printed press, levels of literacy, etc. And here we would notice certain spectacular differences about those factors in Italy compared to many other Member States. As long as there outstanding differences, for example, concentration of media ownership and party political power over the public media, will not be openly discussed, the Italian pattern will insidiously convince many people. I would like to compare it to a virus. Not dangerous enough to kill the bearer, but definitely sickening him and with the potential of infecting others. Members of European Parliament here should know that in Estonia, one centre left party has recklessly followed the Italian current model by concentrating all public and private resources under the party's command and spreading unilateral messages all over the capital city of Tallinn. I would have nothing against a European discussion on that issue here as well. This is why, unlike the EPP Group, I believe it is time to speak about freedom of press and to adopt a resolution. I really think that the forthcoming resolution should not be considered as some settling of scores between political parties in one or another Member State. But rather considered that the resolution will be an opportunity to promote the values... Thank you ...on which our Union is based on.
