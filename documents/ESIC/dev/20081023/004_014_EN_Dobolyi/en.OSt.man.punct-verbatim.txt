Thank you very much. I'm extremely satisfied with the work of the Ombudsman as explained in his annual report and in his speech. The European Ombudsman is one vital part of the democratic structure and functioning of the Union. The largest proportion of the Ombudsman's inquiries concern lack of transparency and refusal of information. This is an area of our activities that we must improve if we are to become more credible in the eye of the citizens. It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman as well as to support the work of the Petitions Committee. Both deal with the handling of complaints and petitions of of EU matters from citizens that help us to find what is not working at the European level and to take corrective measures. Cases being brought to the Ombudsman and to the Committee on Petitions are of increasing complexity. And therefore require greater investment of resources by the institutions in order the that the citizens concerns are properly addressed. If these concerns are properly addressed, then we will be making some progress towards improving the credibility and confidence in the Union as a whole. Thank you.
