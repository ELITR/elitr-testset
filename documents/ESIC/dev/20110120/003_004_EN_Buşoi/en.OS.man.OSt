Gracias President I would like to start by congratulating the Commission for its flexibility in applying the competition rules during the current financial and economic crisis. It is very important that the crisis was not used as a pretext to eliminate competition. And the Commission has already shown a very firm attitude against cartels, which is a good thing. We need to make sure that there are exit mechanisms and that we come back to normal market conditions as soon as possible. There are some areas, and you said about that, Commissioner, where competition can be enhanced. Such the energy market, where regulated energy prices still distort competition. The completion of the single railway market can also bring important benefits to European travellers. The Commission should also be particularly careful concerning competition on the medicines markets. Especially to those practices of originator producers restricting the entry of generic medicines. Furthermore, I call on the Commission to be firm in securing competition between public and private hospitals by bold action against cross subsidies which favour public hospitals. The Commission needs to better communicate the benefits of competition policy to consumers. Thank you very much.
