Thank you very much President, that was a clever one. I just wanted just relate to to to the issues as far as assent is concerned. I mentioned CARIFORUM. And everyone is feeling very comfortable and and optimistic about the CARIFORUM Agreement, but of course there is still need for certain safeguards. And certainly, in our recent meeting in Guyana, that was absolutely clear from the President and others in in that country, as well as Members of Parliament. Ehm the issue of bananas was raised. And you said there will get duty free and quota free access, fine. But the issue is that case Bar Baroness Ashton the issue is that the agreements that have been signed with Central American, and subsequently with Mercosur and the Andean Pact countries, will reduce the tariffs for them. And whatever we do then is going to make it impo impossible for the banana producers in the ACP to be to remain competitive. So that is a critical issue, and the agreements have been made before the ink has even dried on the CARIFORUM Agreement. There are also deep concerns in the Caribbean about the implementation units, which still hasn't been set up. And there're still problems and that is caused by the tensions that have been created between the various countries in the Caribbean. There's also the issue of Haiti. The Donors' Conference did not produce as satisfactory outcome as we would have liked. And I think there are some concerns about whether the EPA can be fully agreed or worked upon as long as Haiti isn't in there. Just secondly quickly on C么te d'Ivoire, I can just just say that we would like very clear assurances on C么te d'Ivoire It is a country that has experienced over many many years great deal of turmoil and uncertainty and instability And I think it's very i important that we give assent, but also that we have reassurances that you can send in the form of a letter to the negotiators in C么te d'Ivoire and to the Government of the C么te d'Ivoire That we will remain committed to negotiating in good faith for a decent outcome for the people of that country. Thank you.
