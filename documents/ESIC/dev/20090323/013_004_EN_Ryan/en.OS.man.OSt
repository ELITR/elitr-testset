Thank you Mr President. I wish to raise the issue of the sniping and remarks that are being made by is from some quarters about the Irish banking and financial system. The Irish system works within a legal and regulatory policy directive framework dictated by the EU. The system in Ireland is as strong, or as weak, as E as that EU framework. The regulatory system has failed as we all know globally. Ireland is no worse, or no better, than any other place. But I object to hostile comments about Ireland emanating from London, New York and the German media. All these places have experienced regulatory and banking challenges and problems equal to and, in many cases, far worse than those we have faced in Ireland. The constant sniping from some of our EU neighbours has been based on prejudice rather than objective fact. And does little for EU solidarity at a time when Europe is going through enormous financial and economic challenges.
