Thank you very much and thank you to the Commissioner.
And I think I can confirm, as others have done, what we have seen since Cathy Ashton has been Commissioner as we have seen a sea change not only in style and tone, but in vocabulary and now increasingly in substance.
But I'm sure the Commissioner will agree with me and many of us in this room that we still face a formidable task.
As we try now to build and rebuild trust after years of negotiation which have created enormous amounts of tension and acrimony.
In the almost exactly 10 years since Cotonou was signed, we have to remind ourselves what actually was said in the agreements about the trade prospects between ACP and EU.
The wording was "a new framework for trade which is equivalent to their existing situation and in conformity with WTO rules."
And we have to really work much more towards fulfilling those objectives.
The policy of concluding separate deals with separate countries has led to serious inconsistencies.
And I can confirm to those who don't know the JPA, who do not have as much contact with parliamentarians in the ACP as I and others in this room have.
That it has created really very difficult situations and severely damaged the cohesion that I perceived amongst the ACP in the past.
And I know that just a few weeks ago the new President of Ghana wrote a letter on behalf of the entire ACP group to the EU Presidency.
And he claimed that the EPA process continued to threaten the very existence of some of the regional integration groupings.
And that is a recent comment by a new president.
And president's ACP parliamentarians tell us at every single one of our meetings that there has barely been any engagement with them and little, if any, consultation with them.
I'd like the Commissioner to tell us what she might think is appropriate in the future on this.
I'm pleased to see what has happened in the SADC negotiations, but of course clear commitments on the modification of texts, transition periods for tariff regularisation, safeguards, rules of origin etc. all of those things are now there open for grabs if you like with SADC
And hopefully you will confirm that they are options for all the ACP countries who will be continuing to negotiate.
Will you tell us please, Commissioner, that you will insist on precise commitments in an EPA to development programmes and that trade liberalisation has to be linked to development benchmarks?
If that is the case, how will you do it?
Will you see to it that there are legally binding commitments in EPAs to the provision of time-scaled and predictable funding?
Commissioner, I think the ACP countries, as you said to us earlier, they face a period of slower growth and, for the first time in 25 years, efforts to reduce poverty are being brought to a close.
I have just two final quick points, one on the CARIFORUM EPA.
It's not a perfect outcome but it still needs safeguards.
Dženkuje barzo I'm very sorry but...
Just quickly on Côte d'Ivoire, we need to have the reassurances that Erika Mann asked for...
