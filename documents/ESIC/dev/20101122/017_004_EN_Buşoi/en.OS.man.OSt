Thank you very much.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the other colleagues who have contributed to this dossier.
I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Dalli.
I think we have come to good result and now the report is much more patient-oriented than the initial proposal was.
Nowadays, patients increasingly tend to seek health-related information so that they can be actively involved in the decisions concerning their health.
Patients also tend to seek information online.
And this information on internet is not something easy to control.
But sooner or later we have to deal with this problem, which will not disappear if we simply don't do anything because it's too complicated.
I therefore support imposing strict rules for the registration and monitoring of websites.
As well as making available a list of registered websites so that patients can be sure of the reliability of their source.
Safeguards are also needed, and the report provides them.
Namely by limiting the information that can be made available to information approved by the competent authorities.
To this end, we have adopted in INCO number of amendments covering advertising, concentrating on changing the wording from "disseminate" to "make available" in the context of non-promotional information according to the "pull principle," whereby patients have access to information if they need it.
Thank you very much.
