Thank you Mr Chair.
Nowadays we are faced with a paradox.
Although a majority of European consumers repeatedly profiled themselves against GMOs, surveys show that they do buy GM foods when they are available in supermarkets.
Many consumers are just not aware that GM food is sold in Europe.
Or simply fall in the trap of illegible labels and end up not to knowing what they buy.
A possible solution would be to allow to mention on the labels the absence of GMO in foods.
But currently there are no common provisions in GM- free labelling, leaving the Member States the freedom of choice.
This leads to confusion of consumers and distortion of the internal market.
As while some countries have already introduced non-GM labelling provisions, others refuse to allow this kind of information to be given.
People want to make food choices based on their own values and not according to safety assessment studies.
If we care about the consumers' concerns, then we should be transparent all the way and give them a real choice.
Therefore I call on the Commission to provide the legal framework for voluntary GM-free labelling at the European level.
Thank you.
