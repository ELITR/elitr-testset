Mr President, ehm it it gives me pleasure to speak on this most important debate this morning. Eh And I would emphasise how very important to the North West of England the transportation of live animals is. We would much rather as the Chairman of the Agricultural Committee said, have these animals slaughtered and transported eh eh after they died and be processed away from the base if the movement of the meat is needed. But in the North West, we have a lot of horses, we have a lot of sheep and a lot of cattle. Lot of movements of animals. And I was a national Member of the Parliament for 18 years. This was a continuous problem, raised time and time again with me by my constituents. And I submit that things have not really improved over the last 10 or 20 years. Ehm I am delighted that this question has been tabled. Because the first year was 2007 and reports had to be in by June of nine 2008, but I submit that really we are behind programme. I listened to what the Commissioner said. That he will have a look at the advantage of the satellite monitoring. And that is a good idea. But when I put to you, Mr Commissioner that there are so many detailed checks that are engrained in the Regulation, quite rightly. Things like the fitness for transport of the animals, transport practices, means of transport, eh about sea containers, integral journey times, resting periods, space allowances. These are all matters that cannot be viewed from satellite. They need detailed inspections, and lessons learned. And I would have hoped that we would have a date in his final remarks. Whereby he hopes to wind up and put his proposals and conclusions at this early time in this implementation of the Regulation. Because, the sooner something is done to improve the situation, the better. It is appalling that these long journey times eh have to be faced by animals in their last few days of life. The consumers want to see, as they want to see with free range hens and eggs. They want to see that we are being humane as ehm humans. And they will pay an added price for the meat because they want to see us being caring for these animals that are so precious and needful for our food needs.
