European Obesity Day is an initiative which brings together medical, patient and political communities to support overweight and obese European citizens.
Its objective is to establish 22 May as the annual European Obesity Day, to raise awareness of the need for action at European level and to ensure that the voices of overweight and obese patients are heard.
Obesity is a disease, not a problem.
Each Member State should face the challenge and provide efficient support to this population group.
According to the World Health Organisation, the statistics of obesity in the whole of Europe, not just the EU, are staggering, reaching epidemic proportions.
If no action is taken, there will be an estimated 150 million obese adults, 20 percent of the population and 15 million obese children and adolescents, 10 percent of the population in the region by 2020
We must therefore strengthen the voice of obese and overweight patients.
