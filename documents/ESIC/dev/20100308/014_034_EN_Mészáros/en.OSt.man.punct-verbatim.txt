Thank you Mr President, my contribution addresses the need for unified approach to Kosovo recognition. By adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, our Member States have accepted a lot of new commitments. One of these is the new integrated and unified proceeding in foreign and neighbou neighbourhood policy. Kosovo has been recognised as independent state, so far, by 65 countries of the world, including 24 out of 28 NATO countries and 22 out of 27 EU countries. This is the right time to encourage our hesitating Member States, namely Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain, to pus to put aside their concerns in this matter and join the majority in Kosovo recognition as soon as possible. This would be an important signal in demonstration of the increasing unity and integration of the EU. Thank you.
