Merci President
As a shadow rapporteur from the Liberal Group, I would like to thank Malcolm Harbour and my other colleagues for their excellent cooperation.
This dossier has been of great importance for all electronic communications users in the European Union.
And I think that the compromise that we agreed in the end with the Council, and it was not at all easy discussion and negotiation, was a balanced one.
We have some important achievements as a result of the negotiations with the Council.
One of the great improvements compared to our first reading is related to the access to the 112 European emergency number.
And the obligation for operators to make caller location available without any derogation on the grounds of technical feasibility, at least for fixed and mobile telephone operators.
This is a major achievement since it will help emergency services to respond more efficiently.
And will enhance the protection of all citizens lives wherever they are in the European Union.
The provisions on traffic management policies were a controversial point of the report.
But I strongly believe that the compromise protects users rights to access content and use services of their own choice.
I think all the members of this House agree that nobody ever wanted to restrict freedom on Internet.
Our objective was to allow traffic management procedures, as long as they are necessary, to ensure the best possible online experience for end-users.
And as long as they do not restrict competition between service providers.
I consider the compromise to be totally in line with this objective, which is why I fully support it.
I also believe that all measures regarding access to end-use and services should respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens, and this has also been safeguarded in the report.
Some of us may not be happy with this compromise.
But I'd like to stress that, despite that shortcomings you may find in it.
It's still the best we could achieve with the Council, and I strongly advise you tomorrow to vote for.
Thank you very much.
