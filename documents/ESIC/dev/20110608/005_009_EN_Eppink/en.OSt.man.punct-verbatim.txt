This morning, Mr Daul came running to speak here in the plenary on the need of a bigger EU budget. But he was running so fast that he was running out of breath and he had to stop speaking. It reflects very well the debate on the multiannual budget. The EU budget is fixed at about 1 percent of EU GDP. Commission and Parliament say: "that's not enough, we want more money." Yet the EU is unable to spend the money available. Billions of euros in regional cohesion funds remain unspent. Some money has to be returned to Member States. So why do you need more money if you cannot spend the money you have? But then, here in this Parliament we have a couple of "Pavlovs." Mr Schulz, Mr Daul, Mr Verhofstadt, all absent now. They have run away instead of speaking here to focus the budget on quality rather than quantity. For example, limut limit regional and cohesion funds to the poorer Member States. Saving 30 percent of those funds, and invest that money in innovation and future oriented policies. But I'm sure Mr President, that the EU Pavlovs will yet again run into the brick wall of the EU Council later this year. Thank you.
