Thank you Mr President, Commisioner. First of all I'd like to congratulate Mr Klinz, the rapporteur, for this excellent report. I think that he has worked extremely hard to get a compromise, an agree an agreed compromise and I congratulate him on that. The revised UCITS directive will, when it enters into effect, serve to reduce much burdesome burdensome red tape and unnecessary costs. During compromise negotiations, certain specific concerns of some Member States were recognised, allowing for the production of a strong and widely supported proposal. I believe it not only protects consumers and also it is good inve for investors. And as has already been said by some speakers, an open market is a positive thing and can be a very good thing for all of us if it's well regulated. UCITS revision is yet another recognition that the financial markets of today are so integrated that we need common rules and standards for the effective regulation and operation of the global financial services industry. And I think that that's not only ehm re rec in Europe but also globally, as we go through unprecedented financial times. I think it's very very important that we work together and at a global level to try and resolve the problems. Can I just say that today is a great occasion that we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the euro currency, which itself serves as an illustration of the importance of ec economic cooperation. It is fortunate that my own country, Ireland, is a member of the euro zone as the current currency has been a source of stability for Ireland and other countries at a time of unprecedented turbulence and during the current global recession. If Ireland was not in the euro zone, unfortunately we'd probably be in the position sadly of Iceland, but that is not the case. I would like to remind some of the Irish Members in this House Sinn FÃ©in in particular that if they had their ti their way, we would not be in the euro. They described it at the time as a backward step. Ireland would not be in the monetary union and Ireland's economic po position would be as bad as Iceland's. I'd like to remind those who opposed the European project in Ireland that many countries around the world are now using Ireland's rejection of the Lisbon Treaty and exploiting the confusion over its possible or perceived repercussions to win over new eh projects, new contracts at the expense of Ireland. Economically, Ireland must stay at the centre of decision making in Europe, where we have traditionally been and where our enterprise needs and wants Ireland to be. Thank you.
