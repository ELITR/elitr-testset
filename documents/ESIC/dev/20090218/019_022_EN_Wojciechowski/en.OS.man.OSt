...-resident, Madam Commissioner, High Commissioner.
The citizens of Europe need a strong Union with a competitive foreign, security and defence policy.
This will not happen if our Union keeps idle in one place.
China and India are not only growing in economic power, but also in military might.
Europe's competitive advantage should be based on knowledge and innovation.
This should be nurtured and supported by all of us.
In an effective security strategy, our European forces should have access to equipment and resources of the highest quality.
While the United States spends trillions of dollars on security, Europe are slow or idle in developing our own strategy.
In a time of crisis, we are closing firearms factories, like in Radom, Poland.
We should instead be investing in advanced technologies, such as the recoilless technologies developed in Poland as we speak.
Innovation creates new business and jobs.
We can't build European capabilities by shutting down our own factories.
Thank you.
