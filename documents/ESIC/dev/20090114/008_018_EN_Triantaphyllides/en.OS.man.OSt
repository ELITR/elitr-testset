Returning from the Gaza Strip after seeing massacre predominantly of civilians I feel the urge to express my fullhearted solidarity with the Palestinian people. They for 17 days have been facing the enormous Israeli war machine that is flagrantly violating international law. I also express support to the peace forces in Israel calling for an end of this war. After a long closure and siege that converted Gaza to the largest open prison in the world, the building of the shameful wall around the West Bank, the continuous expansion of the settlements, after effectively dividing of the Palestinian land, the occupying forces have moved to the fiercest military operation. In this, the rocket attacks against southern Israel, and I stress that I am against any attack from whichever side on civilians, served as the pretext. The ending of the ceasefire on the background of the power games in view of Israeli elections is an insult to a whole nation. The UN Security Council has adopted a resolution. Israel is a state, not an organisation, a member of the United Nations. It has a responsibility towards the international community, and has to comply with this and all other resolutions adopted by the United Nations. There should be respect of international law. No impunity should be permitted any longer. There should be full international investigation. The international community demands the immediate ceasefire, the immediate withdrawal of the military forces, access of humanitarian aid, freedom of movement of the population. Let UNWRA carry out its mission. The EU has taken steps, but only on the humanitarian level. It has to show decisiveness on the political level. Use the clauses of the association agreements. Stop the upgrading of relations with Israel. Stop arms exports to Israel. There can only be a political solution to this conflict. There should be full return to international law, which means ending the 42 year long occupation of Palestine, establishing a sove a sovereign and viable Palestinian state, hence building a peaceful future for both Palestinian and Israeli children. But to save the future, President, to save the future generations, we need to stop the war now.
