Thank you Chair, honourable Commisioner, honourable colleagues.
We welcome the progress made by the Republic of Moldova and hope that the forthcoming electoral process can further consolidate the democratic institutions and and provide the respect of rule of law and of human rights in Moldova.
We know that broad support for Moldova's future EU membership, not NATO membership, within Moldovan society exists.
In spite of the different political platforms, all parties represented in the Moldovan Parliament declares that they are for European cooperation and integration as well.
But, taking into account my own country's Latvia's experience in EU membership, I have tried to explain during my conversations with Moldovan politicians that the EU membership can't be an end in itself.
It is very important to step up efforts to implement deep and consistent economic and judicial reforms, notably with the fight against corruption.
The Moldovan society is multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic and plus essential differences when estimating historical events exists.
Therefore it's quite dangerous to create additional dividing lines within the society.
By my opinion, a recent decree establishing 28 June as Soviet Occupation Day, that have triggered off negative reaction of a big part of Moldovan residents, did not consolidate its society, but had just opposite consequences.
Moldovan society varies by state belongings of its residents as well.
A big proportions of those having double citizenship creates additional differences in the rights as well.
And so we have to make all efforts to abolish these differences and to provide a visa-free regime for all Moldovans.
Thank you.
