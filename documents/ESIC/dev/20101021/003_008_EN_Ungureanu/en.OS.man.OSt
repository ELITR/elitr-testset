...you Mr Chairman, thank you Mr Commissioner.
There is ample proof that Moldova's commitment to European values and standards is genuine and effective.
Moldova is actually the best example of implementing pro-European policies among our Eastern neighbours.
In actual fact, Moldova's euro-credentials make it fully compatible with Western Balkan states.
The positive precedent set by Moldova should be acknowledged and encouraged.
The deterioration of democratic institutions in neighbouring Ukraine increases the importance of Moldova for EU's policies on its eastern flank.
In this context, it is vital that the general elections on 28 November confirm Moldova's continued drive towards European integration.
Mr Chairman and Commissioner, it is indeed high time for the EU to send a positive signal towards Moldova and the Moldovans.
Thousands of Moldovan families are divided by a visa barrier.
The EU-Moldova visa dialogue presents us with a huge opportunity.
This dialogue should enter an operational phase.
Let's hope that the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 October will invite the Commission to elaborate an action plan for visa liberalisation.
A pro-European, integrated Moldova would have a beneficial effect on the EU's eastern frontier, where weak governance and unsolved conflicts are a continuous threat to European stability.
Thank you very much.
