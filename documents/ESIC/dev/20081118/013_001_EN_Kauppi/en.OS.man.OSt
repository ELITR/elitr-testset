Thank you very much Mr President. I have problems in finding my seats. So I'm lucky that I'm here at the right place. Eeh yes. This report is part of the simplification package of the company law. It's very important that in the European Union we try to simplify the environment for companies to flourish and to create growth for European economy. The aim is to diminish administrative burdens as regards publication and translation obligations of certain types of companies. The proposal is part of the wide ranging administrative burden reduction exercise. It would free up and redirect business resources and thus enhance the competitivity of the European economies. Nowadays, under the First Company Law Directive, companies need to publish certain information in the national gazettes that has to be entered into the Member States' commercial registers. In most cases, publication in the national gazette entails additional costs for the companies without providing real added value. The obe objective of this proposal is therefore to remove additional publication requirements in national law that cause additional costs for the companies. Anyhow, the Commission leaves flexibility for Member States in in terms of this additional publication requirements. It is still possible for Member States to have additional requirements eh but they should be covered in the single fee which would be proposed to the new electronic platform. Member States should all have electronic platforms containing the full information and providing access to this information in the companies' electronic file in the register. This would be a cost effective and an easily accessible way to provide all the necessary information regarding the companies. In some Member States we already have these electronic re registers and databases, but in some Member States we we still have not this kind of dig digital database. This proposal... The most important thing is to introduce the single fee set by the Member States that covers all the costs related to the publication and administration requirements. This single fee should also cover these possible additional national requirements eh which publish of information on local and regional newspapers as well. However, eh in the Legal Affairs Committee we have also wanted to introduce some flexibility in terms of these costs. And we now say that, if there are well founded reasons, eh that would be possible for Member States to have additional additional fees. Regarding the 11th Company Law Directive, this proposal deals with the translation requirements for documents to be filed in registers of company branches. When registering a branch, companies need to file certain information also in the register of the company branch. This often leads to remarp remarkable additional costs for companies as they not only have to ensure the translation of certain documents into the language of the Member States where the branch is situated. But also have to comply with sometimes excessive requirements for certification and notarisation of that translation. So now we try to eh ease translation o eh translation obligations by having this certification and authorisation abolished. The objective is to reduce the costs for translation and certification to the minimum. This leads also to benefits for companies by achieving a certain reduction in costs while ensuring the reliability of the translations. I try I agree with the Commission proposal and try to keep my wording as close as to the Commission proposal as possible. However, it was not possible to reach a consensus based on on the Commission proposal here in the Parliament. In the report eh we have now introduced some amendments to clarify the practical implementation of the provisions related to publication costs and translation provisions. And we also introduced some technical amendments in order to ensure that correct cross referencing with the Second Company Law Directive is there. The Legal Affairs Committee introduced also three compromise amendments effected by fellow of the colleagues eh that we can eh eh have these additional publication requirements if they are well grounded, and there are reasons for that. But we put them into recitals, they are not in the articles. And I think it's very important that this is a recommendation in the recitals for the Member States to use this flexibility, but we don't ask them to do that. If the Member State feels that they they their companies really need to have also this publication in the national gazette, regional gazette. And this is really something that Member States eh wants. They can do it, but we don't put them to the articles. The second issue is that I, personally, tried to introduce a transition period, which I still think would be a very good way forward. That eh in the transition period eh these publication requirements would be there, but when when the transition period is over eh we would have only the electronic database. I think this kind of proposal for a transition period would be in line also in the internet penetration. Some Member States have better internet penetration than others And maybe we could then after the transition period eh make sure that there is enough distribution of information in all Member States. So we could take into account the fact that internet penetration in all the Member States is not on the same level. Thank you very much.
