Thank you very much.
I would like to make a comment about the procedure.
Mrs van den Burg already told that the French presidency has not really behaved very well with this dossier.
We have tried to propose several possibilities for trialogue meetings to discuss about possible compromises.
Unfortunately the French presidency is unwilling to come to these meetings.
They are unwilling to organise meetings in the Council working group in order to discuss the way forward.
And also they are not present here today to discuss about this very important matter.
The Legal Affairs Committee view gives a lot of flexibility for the Member States.
It gives much more flexibility than my personal view actually is.
But that is ...
The Legal Affairs Committee view is going as far as possible we can go.
This is the only proposal on table in Parliament at the moment.
So my view is: if the Council which we have tried to request them to do.
If the Council is not able to accept the view of the European Parliament, which we are going to vote tomorrow, which is the legal Affairs Committee view.
If they are not going to able to vote on this particular proposal, we have to go to the second reading.
We cannot allow Council to play us.
If this is not accepted like the European Parliament now will vote tomorrow, we will certainly have a delay in the process.
We don't have this project ready maybe even before the elections.
And also there is a risk like we have heard that the Commission withdraws the proposal.
And I think that it's very disappointing that the Council doesn't have a qualified majority behind it and they are not coming up with the proposals how to reach a compromise.
We would be willing to discuss about compromises.
I would personally be very happy if the Council would propose us something in the trialogue meeting on which we could then base the compromise on.
But they are simply hiding and they are not coming to meetings and they are not organising trialogues.
And it leaves us in a very difficult situation.
So that is why I really upset about the discussions about the procedure.
I hope that we don't have to go into that that the Commission withdraws the proposal.
I hope there will still be an opportunity to have a compromise which would suit all the Member States and also the European Parliament.
