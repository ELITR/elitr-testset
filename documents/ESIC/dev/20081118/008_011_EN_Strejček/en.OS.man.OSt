Thank you Mr President. Let me explain why I voted against the report Ber√®s Langen. There are at least three points that I'd like to stress now. The very first one is that the report calls for a higher and deeper coordination of economic and financial national policies. The second one is that it will entail highly coordinated fiscal policy which will need political unification. And the consequence of the political unife unification is the third point why I voted against. I do not share the view that political coordination that eliminates natural differences among Member States will become the remedy and a healing answer to current European problems. Eh the current European problems are free movement of labour, free movement of capital and services. Thank you very much Mr President.
