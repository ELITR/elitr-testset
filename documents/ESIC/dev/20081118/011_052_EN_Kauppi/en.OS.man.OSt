...you very much, Mr Speaker. I think lots of things have been said about the financial crisis but it's very important to have one viewpoint. We are too self critical at the moment in this Parliament and also too self critical vis Ã  vis the EU institutions. Let's not forget that we have done a very radical overhaul of our financial services legislation during the last eight years. We have proper laws. We have proper regulations and also the supervisory system has been improved. Of course we could not avoid the crisis, but we were not also the birthplace of this crisis. It was born in America. It was born in United States because their lack of regulation, their lack of supervision and their lack of proper imple implementation. We should avoid over reacting in Europe. This is not the proper time to give in, eh having good impact assessments and better regulation agenda, as Mr Bushill Matthews just said. This is the perfect time to have well targeted, well prepared proposals and take them through. If we are doing the wrong reaction it might have seve serious consequences. It might eh eh bring us even more serious crisis. For example, if we are accepting legislation which makes it more difficult for financial markets to recover, it is not in the benefit of European citizens. We should now take it eh cool and we should try to avoid eh having improper, eh not well targeted, well prepared legislation and not be too self critical. Commission needs really thanks that they have dri driven through this very important change in European legislation and supervisory regime.
