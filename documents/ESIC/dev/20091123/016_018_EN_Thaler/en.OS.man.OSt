Thank you Mr President.
Two Azerbaijani youth activists and bloggers, Emin Abdullayev and Adnan Hajizade, have been sentenced to two and a half years and two years respectively, in an unfair trial.
The charges against them were fabricated and they have been imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and association.
The Azerbaijani authorities must release the prisoners of conscience, Adnan Hajizade and Emin Abdullayev, immediately and unconditionally.
The Council, the Commission and the Member States of the European Union must raise the issue of democracy and human rights with Azerbaijani Government.
It must be reminded that democratisation is one of the goals of the Eastern Partnership, and Azerbaijan is part of this initiative.
Azerbaijan has to live up to its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and a partner of the European Union.
Thank you.
