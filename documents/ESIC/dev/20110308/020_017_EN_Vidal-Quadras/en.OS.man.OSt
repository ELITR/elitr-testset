In terms of energy, in which the Union is facing high import dependency, much has been done to reduce this constant risks associated to our vulnerability.
Out of which the most recent and clear example was the approval of the regulation on security of gas supply.
With the view to reducing our energy import dependancy no option on our agenda should be neglected.
And this is why I present it together with other colleagues, Written Declaration No 67 on the possibility to exploit alternative sources of gas in the European Union.
In this regard I would like to share three facts with you.
First, renewables represent an increasing part of our energy mix which is positioning gas as the major backup fuel.
Second, the US has proven the existence of technological know-how as well as the economic viability of these unconventional sources.
And third, the Union has a great potential of unconventional sources of gas.
In terms of energy dependency, we are not in the position to miss any opportunity.
