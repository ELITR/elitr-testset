Dear colleagues, Madam President.
I would like to thank you all my colleagues in the European Parliament and also in all the civil organisations for their support and valuable inputs in drafting this heavy report.
If you will allow me for personal comment.
This is the place and time where I have to thank my colleagues in the office, Dr ?? Oskar who has been my political advisor in the LIBE Committee and has been behind this strategy for years.
And Vera ?? who has lead my cabinet in the last few years and fought with me.
I also owe gratitude to my family who allowed me to be in the forefront of this fight.
A fight, in the end of as a result we have an agreement spanning to 6 political groups, 27 Member States and 5 very important committees of the European Parliament.
In this way, I believe we are able to send a message to the Commission, to the Council and the Member States that must be reckoned with and have therefore made a great step towards an EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of our continent's largest ethnic minority.
A significant proportion of European Roma face such substandard conditions.
Almost totally disconnected from the economy resulting in their exclusion from the basic human rights.
That fostering social inclusion cannot be viewed within the framework of general policy ratifications.
But must be handled as bridging one of the hugest gap in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe.
The EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of European Roma must therefore place its primary emphasis on the fulfilment and promotion of the fundamental rights to employment, housing, healthcare and education.
Let me briefly outline the most important principles and recommendations of my report.
Above all, the strategy must be an internal EU strategy.
The general oversight of priority areas and objectives therefore must be within the Community structures.
And it should in no way be divisive for the EU, creating splits among the Member States.
On the contrary.
Establishing a new body to coordinate and supervise the strategy would be unnecessary and would create a wasteful overhead.
The role of supervising, coordinating and monitoring must therefore be fulfilled by the Commission.
And, to this end, it would be worth considering to retain the Roma task force as a permanent body.
The Commission should annually report on the progress of the strategy, evaluate the results and submit its upgrading proposals to the Council.
In this regard, the European Roma strategy scoreboard, a mechanism similar to the single market scoreboard, could be developed.
The appointment of an administrative body or a government official to be the national contact points for the implementation of the objective of the strategy.
And furthermore to act as a source of advice and reflection for the Commission supervisory strategy, would also bring along significant practical benefits.
The strategy must also take into account the territoriality of exclusion.
Since the geographical distribution of social disadvantages is not uniform throughout the Member States.
But poverty and social exclusion is concentrated in underdeveloped micro-regions, which, in many of the new Member States, are predominantly inhabited by the Roma community.
Common, comparable and reliable indicators are essential to present a realistic analysis of progress and to meet the requirements of effective monitoring.
I recommend adopting the Laeken indicators and their complemented components to measure social and territorial exclusion, as well as to evaluate progress.
Livia, please speak slowly.
Slow down.
Thank you.
So I recommend adopting the Laeken indicators and their complemented components to measure social and territorial exclusion, as well as to evaluate progress.
An all-European crisis map is necessary to measure and identify the micro-regions by their distinctive attributes.
Part of the cohesion budget should be set aside in the next multiannual financial framework in a performance reserve for the strategy.
This could provide vital resources and devisive incentives for implementations by allocating funds on a competitive basis defined by the criterion how the proposed project or intervention supports and implements the objectives of the strategy.
This way, on the one hand, we could depart from the general practice of large contributions maximising their returns from the unabsorbed funds.
And, on the other hand, a direct link could be created between the allocation of financing and the reproduction of results.
These are the principles and the priorities I believe the European Roma strategy must sustain and I'm looking forward to your comments on my report.
Thank you very much.
