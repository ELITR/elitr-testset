Thank you Madam President.
I would like to point out one minor moment or aspect where we could save money.
And if we calculate how much do we pay annually to Mr Bill Gates for using his Windows software.
It's a huge sum of money.
Even though Bill Gates is a nice chap he donates a lot of it to good causes.
But if we use open software more bravely in this House, it would be a step towards cleaner, cheaper and modern management.
Thank you.
