Thank you Mrs President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues. First, let me wish to all women a happy anniversary for this important date, 8 March. The day which marks 100 years of life, 100 years of struggle for women's rights. Then I would like to thank to all my colleagues, to the shadows, to the members of the secretariat for their contributions to this report. My report deals with an issue which is both general and eminently concrete by its consequences: female poverty. 85 million Europeans live below the poverty line and 70 percent of all women in the EU are as living in poverty. These are the facts. The economic, financial and social crisis affect all of us, but it particularly harms women in the labour market and in their personal lives. Since they are more likely to be in insecure jobs, more likely to be made redundant and less likely to have social security. This is how things stand at present. What can we do? The women are waiting from us for concrete proposals, for concrete measures. It's 8 March and I try to summarise my report in eight points. First and foremost, we call on the Member States to take into account the gender dimension in their plans for recovery from the recession by promoting and boosting the employment of women. And adopting specific measures as well as to adjust budgets to ensure equality of access to public sector expenditure. With a view to both enhancing productive capacity and meeting women's social and environmental needs. Second, we call on the Commission and the Member States to take the appropriate measures to eliminate gender inequalities in employment as part of the EU 2020. I strongly encourage establishing as an objective the reduction of the gender pay gap by 1 percent each year, in order to achieve the target of 10 percent reduction by 2020. I stress also the need for positive actions to increase women representation in political, economic and corporate decision making bodies. The third issue is related to the reconciliation between private and professional life. I call on the Council and the Member States to renew and fulfil their commitments related to the Barcelona targets for the provision of accessible, affordable and high quality childcare. And to develop new targets for the care of dependent persons. Fourth point, we call on the Commission and Member States to frame health policies which aim to combat and prevent practices that harm women's health and are cause of social excla exclusion and poverty. Fifth issue, we call on the Member States to adopt the necessary measures in order to offer better opportunities for women in education we while fighting stereotypes as well as eliminating traditional role models in school curricula. The sixth point is the there is a direct link between the social conditions of the families and children's growth. Therefore, we call the Commission and the Council to develop and implement a strategy to halve child poverty by 2012. Seventh point, we should not ignore violence against women. It has an increasing impact on the risk of marginalisation, poverty and social exclusion. I call on the Commission to establish a European Year for combating violence against women. And eighth point, let's underline the importance of the Structural Funds, in particular, the European Social Fund, as key tools for assisting Member States to combat poverty and social exclusion. I think that we can do it. We have the power. We have the force, the intelligence to tackle this important issue at European level and all Member States. Thank you very much. We have the strength and the intelligence to tackle this important issue at European level and in all Member States.
