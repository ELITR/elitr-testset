Thank you Mrs President.
With about 1.5 million members of this minority, Romania is home for the largest Roma community in Europe.
The social integration of Roma lags behind, being considered an Utopia by many, both in the administration and in the community.
Actually, the Romanian Government deals fully with the integration of this minority.
Therefore, we need a European strategy to frame the national efforts aiming to provide the socio-economic inclusion for the Roma, education, training opportunities and job assistance, especially for women.
It is crucial to support the retreatment and continued employment in order to avoid social exclusion and poverty.
And I strongly support the initiative that the Commission to present annually a follow-up of the EU strategy on Roma inclusion.
I would like also to congratulate Járóka, also Kinga Göncz, and I welcome the commitment of the Council and the Commission.
Thank you very much.
