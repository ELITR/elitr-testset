Thank you very much, I'll be very short.
I would like to thank very much all your valuable comments.
Reinforcing my and my very good shadow rapporteurs view that political slogans will never become a reality without a proper legal basis, financial support and incentives.
As well as an EU mechanism to coordinate the actions of the stakeholders, ranging from local governments up to the Council.
And harnessing the advantages of multi-level governance.
I think it will bring a new aspect of the whole story.
I firmly believe that, on the grounds of the tasks, objectives, principles and instruments defined by all the Treaties and the Charter of the Fundamental Rights.
And furthermore based on the shared competences as well as the supporting, coordinating and complementary actions of the Union, a very strong European Roma strategy, strategy on Roma inclusion, can come into existence.
As a conclusion I would like to say my 6 years hope, that the Communication of the Commission is going to be able to endorse these points.
And it's going to be a very good basis for the Hungarian Presidency to pledge to their commitment to launch this European Roma strategy.
I am very grateful for this.
I'm aware that this European strategy is not going to solve the problem.
I know that huge amount is depending on us, on Roma.
Words and promises mean nothing without actions outside of Brussels and even in the Roma settlements.
Governments and Roma must do what they have signed up to.
To take the determined action to deliver tangible results.
We understand our responsibility in this and we are fully for our common partnership.
This process for us Roma, and I believe it's for the whole European Union, is much more about the mutual trust.
It's also about building a community of values that we can all share, and that we can all enjoy.
To be able to really challenge these difficulties that we have been discussing here in the last 6 years.
And I thank you very much for all your support.
And I would like to join Renate Weber and the other shadow rapporteurs in thanking the Libe secretariat and all the advisers who, with us, have been fighting on this very very strongly.
Thank you very much.
