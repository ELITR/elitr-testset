Thank you very much President. I would like to thank to Commissioner Reding, the Commissioner Andor for their strong commitments on these important issues. I would like to thank to all my colleagues for their strong messages on this important debate today. First of all, I would like to say that gender equality it's not only a matter of social justice. But it's a matter for progress and we need to build together a fair society for all of us. Then I would like to say that I strongly support the quotas. Yes, we need the women in the top positions, but let's not forget the poverty. We have to tackle, we have to prevent and reduce the poverty and we need concrete measures. the by pre Preventing and reducing the poverty this is an important component of social solidarity and I strongly believe in women's solidarity. We need the support for all of the citizens. We need the support from the whole society and I would like to thank to the NGOs, to the social partners. To all women and men in the society who are fighting year by year, day by day, to achieve the gender equality. We have to make this gender equality to become a reality. We can accelerate on the track today. Let's make together things happen. And I wish again, to all women happy days. Thank you very much.
