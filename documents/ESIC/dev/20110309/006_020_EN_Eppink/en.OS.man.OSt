Thank you Mr President. We we all agree that Mr Gaddafi was a murderer, and I agree with Mr Schulz. And then I just wonder why, over the past years, our EU leaders was were trying to charm him. Here I've got a picture of Mr Van Rompuy, just in his office and already in the wrong company. And here we have Mr Verhofstadt receiving the dictator with military honour, which he certainly likes. And here we have Mr Berlusconi, Mr Cohn Bendit. We know that Mr Berlusconi likes kissing, but he is kissing entirely the wrong person. Now I also have got here Mrs Mrs Ashton, I've got Tony Blair, your former boss, kissing the dictator. Now my point is: I agree that you have to meet people nastier than yourself, but you do not have to kiss them. You do not have to hug them. You do not have to charm them. And you have been feeding the monster that people are now fighting, and that's why they are getting killed. So I say to all these EU leaders having kissed and hugged Gaddafi: shame on you!
