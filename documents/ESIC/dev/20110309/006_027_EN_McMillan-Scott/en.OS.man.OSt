Thank you Mr President.
Since I was appointed as Vice-President for Democracy and Human Rights, I have tried to use my voice to speak for those who cannot speak.
And as it happens, today in the Chamber we have guests from the National Interim Council of Libya who met the High Representative last night but who cannot take part in the debate.
In my view, and I think in the view of many in this Chamber, before the weekend the European Union must recognise the National Interim Council of Libya.
Whatever else it may do, and I have seen some of the ideas Mrs Ashton will bring forward.
Mr President the defeat of president Gaddafi is not only vital for Libya.
It's vital for the millions of Arabs elsewhere in the Arab world who are struggling for freedom.
If we recognise the interim council officially, it allows humanitarian and other needs, as well as the strategic necessities of the time, to go to that interim council.
The EU must be unequivocal in support of democracy wherever it begins to flower.
Thank you.
