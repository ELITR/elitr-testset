Danke Thank you, eh thanks to rapporteur, Tanja Fajon. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, people have the feeling of being trapped in a cage after the war in the 1990s Now, finally, the door will open for them to get out. Tomorrow is the day that the European Parliament can give a clear sign that people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are welcome visitors in Europe. The European Commission concluded that both countries have fulfilled the benchmarks for visa liberalisation. The reforms are of importance for the country but also for the EU. There is significant progress made in securing the borders, improving the cooperation in combating cross border crime, like human trafficking and drug trafficking. And it will be possible to return persons who are illegally staying in on European soil. The experience of visa liberalisation showed that leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina were willing and able to agree to process the required reforms with speed. The cooperation and effectiveness of these reforms will, hopefully, serve as an example for further reforms needed for EU integration. But this also of huge importance for people who will finally be able to visit their families. Especially with regards to the big diaspora that Bosnia and Herzegovina has in Europe. But also it is essential for the youth and students to envisage their European future. They will have the chance to look over the walls of their own country. Hopefully, they will voice to the new leaders that EU integration should be high on the agenda. Last thing we want is a black hole in Europe. The European Commission and we in the Parliament want to lift this isolation. We promised the countries visa liberalisation when they would fulfil the criteria. With the Commission and the European Parliament's consent, two thirds of the European institutions will recognise their effort and progress. I want to see that the Council will also fulfil its promise so that, finally, Bosnian and Albanian people will see that there is light at the end of the long tunnel. Thank you.
