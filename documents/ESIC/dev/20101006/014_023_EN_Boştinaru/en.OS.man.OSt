...you Mr President, Mrs Commissioner, dear colleagues.
I think that we should support the visa-free regime for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina. And I welcome very much the report of Tanja Fajon.
But with regard to Albania, we must make sure that they get the message that a positive vote in the European Parliament does not in any way mean a reward for the Albanian Government.
It is instead only a relief for the Albanian citizens, who, for over a year, have had to bear the consequences of a never-ending political crisis.
It is anyway clear that the positive outcome in the European Parliament would only be half of the way for Albania, unless they make concrete progress for the and some members of the Council will end up with their reservations.
Until now, the Albanian Government seems do not have made any progress or shown any effort to solve the political crisis.
Despite the resolution adopted by the European Parliament in June.
The only field in which there has been visible progess was corruption.
But unfortunately, in the opposite way of what we expected, with cases of high-ranking members of the Albanian Government daily brought to the public opinion by the media recently in the last months at least, Mrs Commissioner.
This is not the right way towards EU and Albania should listen to the warning before it's too late.
Thank you very much.
