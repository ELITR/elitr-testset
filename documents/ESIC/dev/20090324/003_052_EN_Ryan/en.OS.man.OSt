Thank you Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the the rapporteurs who are involved in this very important report.
I think the economic crisis has forced us to take a long, hard look at our past and economic behaviour.
And that, in turn, I think offers us an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes.
I suppose when our economies were powering ahead, we unfortunately left certain groupings behind.
Addressing and improving access to microcredit offers us the opportunity to address these past mistakes.
Reshaping microcredit framework can help us reinforce and rebuild our economies from the community upwards.
In Ireland some commendable work has been done in this regard.
And in my own constituency of Dublin there are four enterprise boards that have set up since 1993.
And they have been supplying local-level support to microenterprises all over Dublin City and County.
The Association of County and City Boards in Ireland announced its own financial stimulus package earlier this year, aimed at supporting 3000 enterprises around Ireland and creating 15000 new jobs.
The project also includes training for nearly 50000 people.
On a European level these are small figures, but our microcredit enterprise in Dublin and Ireland is hugely significant.
I sincerely hope that, following on from this excellent report, we see significant and coordinated action at Community level to support the invaluable work that is being done by and for microenterprise at local and national level around the European Union.
As it is a very important part of our economy today and a very important part of our economy into the future.
