Danke schön Herr Präsident, Madam Präsidentin.
Dear colleagues, before we open the debate on the report on the implementation of the Structural Funds Regulation 2007-2013.
Allow me to seize this opportunity to thank the Commission for the concrete communication paper and the country fiches as a solid base on work on.
And I would especially like to thank those who worked with me on the report, especially our EPP-ED adviser, Ms Stoian, and our committee administrator, Mr Chopin, who both devoted long hours to this report.
And now let me briefly recapitulate making of this report, which has obtained, withholding few compromises, full support within the Regional Development Committee just last month.
As you may already know, the aim of this report is to show the way in which the Member States understood and follow the 2006 Community strategic guidelines on cohesion when drawing up their 27 national strategic reference frameworks and 429 operational programmes adapted to meet their specific constraints and requirements.
Therefore I have decided to base this report on three main documents.
Communication from the European Commission.
Second the 27 country fiches provided to us by the European Commission.
And third, the Council decision from the year 2006 on the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion.
Which represents an indicative framework for the Member States for the preparation on the national strategic reference frameworks and the operational programmes for the period 2007 and 2013.
The three leading priorities that were clearly set by the previously mentioned Council decision are.
First making Europe and its regions more attractive places in which to invest and work.
Second priority is to improve knowledge and innovation for growth.
And third priority is to attract more people into employment or entrepreneurial activity in order to create more and better jobs.
Before I share what I have observed while working on this report, it is important to underline that the scope of it is partly limited by the fact that the operational programmes were actually approved only in June 2008.
And it will take at least a year before any real advances in their implementation can be assessed.
Nevertheless, I can already assess that the general priorities have been adhered to by all Member States, with specific particularities imposed by their level of economic and territorial development.
Also this is important to note that they might suffer certain changes in the sense of increasing focus on investments in areas with immediate growth potential and urgency in the context of European economic recovery plan.
The Community response to the global financial crisis, and the current economic slowdown.
In other words, it is important to remember that each Member States, and even more regions, have diverse needs arising from their geographical location and economical and institutional development.
Therefore, the resulting tailor-made national cohesion strategies in the operational programme have without doubts significantly vary according to these necessities.
It is known that Member States were required by the general regulation of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Funds to earmark 60 percent of the total expenditure for the cohesion objective and 75 percent for the regional competitiveness and employment objective.
However, I gladly observe the efforts made by the national authorities which have ensured that the average allocation of expenditure for achievement of the Lisbon Agenda constitutes 65 percent.
This is more.
And the available funds in the convergence regions, 82 percent in the regional competitiveness and employment regions, which is in fact more than it was initially requested.
I see my time is over.
I had much more prepared.
I will finish at the end of this debate.
Thank you very much.
