Dear Mr Chairman, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues. The directive that we discuss aims to limit animal tests and improve the conditions of animals used for research. In Europe, we already have the highest animal welfare standards in the world and this directive will raise those standards even further. This is very plausible. Nonetheless, we must bear in mind that human beings and our human prosperity mean more than the well being of animals. And there is a fundamental difference in dignity between animals and human beings dignity. I appreciate a balance between stricter rules on animal welfare and the use of animals, while still allowing research under strict conditions. I support the "three Rs" principle: replace animal tests where wherever possible with other methods. Reduce the number of animals used to a minimum and refine standards for breeding, accommodation and care. Animal tests will only be allowed if no other alter alternative method is available. At the same time, medical research will still be possible. Which will provide balance between the ethical necessity of the reduction of animal testing and the requirements of modern medical research. Here, I would like to strongly oppose alternative methods to animal testing which could include tests based on the use of human embryonic stem cells. I am concerned about those Member States where domestic laws does not explicitly exclude from the compulsory alternative testing methods those which involve the use of human embryos. With this directive coming into force, Member States could be obliged to ensure that these alternative methods will be applied, no matter whether or not they are based on stem cells coming from embryos. Therefore I will abstain at the final vote, and I call on Member States to provide for other alternatives than those involving the destruction of human life. Thank you very much.
