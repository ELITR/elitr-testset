Thank you Mr President.
This is an important issue, and I thank colleagues for understanding the concerns my region is having with a particular French decision with Mistral platforms.
EU Code of Conduct, which is now legally binding text since 2008, is a good step but not enough, as has been mentioned also by our Liberal colleague.
We should continue our work on a global-level arms trade because the EU responsibility is great.
We are responsible for one third of the volume in arms trade.
If the proposition is that Russia is our strategic partner and we can cooperate on military affairs with Russia, for me is question of logic.
Why does our friend need an assault weapon system?
To improve a situation, to participate in an effort to organise some sort of good governance in Afghanistan?
No, Moscow has no intention to participate in that operation.
To protect human and minority rights in Kyrgyzstan?
No, and in both cases Mistral is no use because it cannot approach these landlocked countries.
It's going to change the situation in Black Sea, not for better, but for worse, and also affect eight European Union Member States around the Baltic Sea.
And also the security situation of those states, starting from Poland and Germany and ending with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, will worsen.
I agree with Mr Gualtieri that cooperation with our strategic partner is a good thing but, believe me, there are other fields to cooperate with Russia than high-tech weapon systems.
Think about cars, this is something Russian industry is also struggling with.
Think about cooperation between fire brigades.
Because the Russian fire fighters were in trouble this summer when a territory of forest equal to the size of Belgium was burning.
Ceterum censeo.
The sale of Mistral needs to be cancelled.
Thank you.
