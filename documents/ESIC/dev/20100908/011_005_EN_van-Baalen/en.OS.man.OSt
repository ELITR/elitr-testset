Thank you Mr President. I want to be clear that indeed you are able to defend yourself, other countries are able to defend themselves, so arms exports are not off limits. That is the position of the ALDE Group. However, we should not export to regions of tension or war. I mean, we should limit ourselves. And if we don't have a real, legally binding regime on arms exports, it means that the 27 countries of the European Union will not have a level playing field. They will compete and fight for orders and consultation is not a real thing. So I think that the only way of to resolve this issue is to have a binding common regime. And I support also the words of my colleague, Mr Brok, in this matter. I thank you very much.
