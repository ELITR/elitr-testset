Thank you Mr Commissioner.
Three main concerns we do have with this Nabucco.
Is that the project is developed too slowly and in a lacklustre way.
And we don't like the Commission's position, reiterated by Mr Landaburu a week ago, which stated that Commission is neutral between South Stream and Nabucco.
Commission should be in favour of Nabucco.
Secondly, we wish Commission to become more active vis-Ã -vis those Member State governments who then and again seek to receive better competitive edge and advantages on the cost of other Member States.
I will not mention those countries today, but I just say that one has capital called Roma.
If we won't move quickly with Nabucco we will witness similar unpleasant events like in Hungary where Surgutneftegas company obtained critical amount of shares in Hungarian company MOL.
And also similar situation prevails in Baumgarten, Austria.
We should ...
Okay, thank you and otherwise, Mr Commissioner, we wish you good luck in creating the still missing common energy policies in EU.
