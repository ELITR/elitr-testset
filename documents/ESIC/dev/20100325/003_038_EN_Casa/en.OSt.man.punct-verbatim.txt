Thank you President. Yes 2008 was an extremely important year for the European and indeed the the global economy. It was the year that was characterised by great deal of uncertainty as regards the extent of the crisis, that only seemed to worsen. A great deal of uncertainty was also present with with regard to the time it would take for the European economies to recover. As well as the tools that we should use to stimulate such a recovery. Hence this was no easy year for the ECB, which had to face a number of challenges. Now during the 2008, the ECB engaged other major central banks in order to form a coordinated approach in order to provide the banking system with plenty of short short term liquidity. And this approach that was taken by the ECB proved to be extremely successful. In this respect, I must support my colleague in the conclusions that he has come to concerning the performance of the ECB. I agree that 2008 was instrumental and that those responsible have risen to this occasion. I also share some of the rapporteur's concerns with regard to the need, to the lack of transmission of interest rate cuts from the bank to the consumer. And I feel that this should be further looked into, so please note, Mr Trichet. All in all, I feel that this is an extremely well balanced report, an excellent piece of work of work by my Maltese colleague, Edward Scicluna. Thank you.
