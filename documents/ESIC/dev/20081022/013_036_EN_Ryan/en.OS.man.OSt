Thank you.
And well to say that I'm disappointed in the answer is to put it mildly
And I have to say that's exactly what you told us last June.
Commissioner, you told us that we would have this in September.
And I have to say that there is a rumours around, very strong rumours that you have received an interim report on CCCTB.
And you have not officially accepted it, but I gather that that report shows that the idea of CCCTB is not favourable towards the idea of CCCTB.
And the reason that we cannot see it is because you haven't formally accepted it.
Now I'd like to ask you if that is the case, because I think that it is of the extremely unfair.
That this is an issue that has been debated for considerable time now.
And there is a lot of very strong feeling on both sides on it.
And I believe that you should show us that report, or that interim report, and so that we can have a look at it to see where exactly that Commission and where that report stands on this very, very important issue.
And I really would strongly ask you to do that.
I think it's wrong if you have received an interim report and you're not showing it to us. Because it doesn't show what the Commission wants on this issue.
