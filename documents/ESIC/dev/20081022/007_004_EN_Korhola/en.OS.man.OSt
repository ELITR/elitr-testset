Thank you Chairman. Concerning the Amendment 9, where our group voted against it. It was crucial for EPP ED that the democratic process should be completed without any short cuts that create democratic deficit. Especially now when in in the case of emission trading, the parliamentary process cannot be described in a flattering manner. We have seen misleading tricks, manipulation and, finally, the rapporteur ignoring the political will of her own group. This has become even more relevant given the deadlock of at Council last week. The EPP has offered a solution to the problem of damaging industry whilst advancing the climate change mitigation. Therefore, not only the EU industry but also the trade unions are supporting our benchmarking proposal to pre replace the costly auctioning system. We are all united in the attempt of to reduce harmful emissions. There is no doubt about that. The question is how to do it. Our first concern must be our planet, but I contend that the measures needed to stop climate change will not be helped by economic decline of the leading climate friendly economy leading to unemployment in the EU. Thank you.
