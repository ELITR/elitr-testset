I see that millions of euros of public money are still being allocated to social engineering and to buy popular support for the EU itself in candidate countries, Member States and elsewhere. We still have roads and bridges that lead nowhere, we are replacing the pavements in Kar√≠nia outside the Turkish casinos no less. And 400 million euros provide electricity in Kosovo, where the subsequent receipts simply disappear. These are highly questionable political iss uses of public money. No wonder the taxpayers in net contributor countries like mine are increasingly objecting to EU funds being given to countries whose tax burden is lower. Sometimes much lower and which effectively replace the lack of local tax revenues. Given the nature of these irregularities, I have written to the Court of Auditors recently to clarify the legality of payments from public funds which are being qualified under international financial accounting standards.
