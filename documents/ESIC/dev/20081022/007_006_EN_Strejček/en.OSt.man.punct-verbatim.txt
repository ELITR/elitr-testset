Thank you Mr Chairman. Let me summarise reaso reasons why I voted against the resolution. First, strengthening of the state's role is wrong answer in looking for a way out from the financial turmoil. Second, higher regulation and creating of a new pan European supervisory authority without clarification of competences are not a remedy to the crisis. Third, having been rejected by people in Ireland, the Lisbon Treaty cannot be enter cannot enter into life. That is why the European Council should respect the outcome of the Irish referendum. And fourth, the European Council is not willing to resign on its own unrealistic and extremely expensive targets concerning the climate change. It will finally harm living standards of ordinary people. Thank you very much.
