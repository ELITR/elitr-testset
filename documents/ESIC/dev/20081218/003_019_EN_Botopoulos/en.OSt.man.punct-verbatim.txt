 Dear rapporteur Ms Wallis. E justice, electronic justice, can we say that such a thing is possible in an activity which is conditioned by the human weaknesses and virtues, that are very human activity? No! Can there be borderless justice? As you said, no, again! Because eh this is a human activity, which is also very different in every part of the world. But does those two "nos" mean that we must turn our back to technological innovation? Again and of course, no! We must of course try to exploit human innovation. A portal for information: yes! Exchange of data: yes! Conscience of the interindependence of the judicial systems: yes! Contribution to the creation of a European demos: yes! But the common faceless justice, and I don't say that you are doing that in your report, no! My father, who was a judge, would not be too eager for me to defend electronic justice before the European Parliament. I myself from the European Parliament to my father, who is in heaven. I can tell him that I know that justice will always be a man, his defender and a judge not before God but before their conscience. Thank you.
