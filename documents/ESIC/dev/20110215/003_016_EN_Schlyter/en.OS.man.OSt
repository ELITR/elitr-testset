...actually you were wrong when you said that this a cold winter across the globe.
No, it's actually just some parts of northern Europe and some parts of central US.
Globally, 2010 was actually one of the hottest years, one of the two hottest years in recorded history.
And actually the fact that it is colder here now is also quite predictable, because if the Gulf Stream is pressed down by meltwater from the Arctic, this is an explainable effect.
So no, it is a a very hot year 2010 and climate change is really real and the measures we do are good for the economy.
