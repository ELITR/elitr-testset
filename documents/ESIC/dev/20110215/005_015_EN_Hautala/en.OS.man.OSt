I join colleagues who are saying that we need smart measures to deal with authoritarian regimes which violate human rights.
And I would like to ask the High representatives here.
Are you prepared to take measures against those who violate human rights, in such a way as indicated in the Parliament's resolution of I believe 15 December
Calling for an asset freeze and visa bans on those 60 officials who can be implicated in the case of Mr Magnitsky, who unfortunately had to die in the prison in Russia.
Would there be one or two courageous foreign ministers who would take his initiative up?
And indeed Mrs High representatives.
If it proved to be true that Judge Viktor Danilkin did write the verdict on Khodorkovsky and Lebedev taking direct orders from the Moscow city court, would such a judge be on such a list?
