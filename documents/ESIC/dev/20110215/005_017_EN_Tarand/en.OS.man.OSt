Thank you.
In my opinion, Mr Schulz has drafted a resolution which is very well founded with arguments and draws correct conclusions.
However, I'm not sure I didn't get the point perhaps of Mr Fleckenstein.
Because if the Rules of Procedure don't allow me to ask a question any more, I would still like to throw it into his ear.
Was he suggesting that we should refrain from supporting this resolution?
Or was it for the opposite, wholehearted Socialist support to adopt it right now?
Thank you.
