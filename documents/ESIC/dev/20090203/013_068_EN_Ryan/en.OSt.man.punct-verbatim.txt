Thank you. I'd like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive answer. Ehm could I just talking about one of the vulnerable groups, eh considering the economic situation that we now face and the increase in unemployment levels, obviously one vulnerable group are young people. Very often, in economic in economically difficult times, young people unfortunately get into drug abuse. And is it possible that the ehm European Social Fund could be used in a targeted way to try and help young people. Considering the problems that this causes not only to themselves as individuals, but to their families and to their communities. Which it can have a very severe eh effect on communities, adding to poverty and ad adding to difficulties? So I was wondering if we could if it's possible under that Fund to target such a vulnerable group. Thank you.
