Thank you.
I'd like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive answer.
Could I just talking about one of the vulnerable groups, considering the economic situation that we now face and the increase in unemployment levels, obviously one vulnerable group are young people.
Very often, in economically difficult times, young people unfortunately get into drug abuse.
And is it possible that the European Social Fund could be used in a targeted way to try and help young people.
Considering the problems that this causes not only to themselves as individuals, but to their families and to their communities.
Which it can have a very severe effect on communities, adding to poverty and adding to difficulties?
So I was wondering if it's possible under that Fund to target such a vulnerable group.
Thank you.
