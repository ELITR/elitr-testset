It is sad to observe that today, almost five years after enlargement, there is only a little evidence of respect that Latvia has demonstrated for its largest minority.
The recommendations of the European Parliament and numerous other institutional organisations have been completely ignored.
A large part of Latvia's population has been alienated from the state and its institutions.
No wonder the naturalisation rate is slow.
Turning people into aliens and issuing them with an alien passport does not inspire in them feelings of being associated with the state.
They do not participate.
They do not take decisions.
They do not vote.
Not even in those cities where they represent up to 40 percent of the population and where political decisions directly affect their lives.
Is this situation good or bad for the European Union?
This is a question for the Commission and Council.
Democracy cannot flourish without civil society, and there is no civil society without participation.
Participation begins at the local community level.
These people were born in the country or have spent most of their lives there.
And we are talking about more than 50 percent of Latvians population, or of 372 000 people.
The EU must take action on their behalf.
Why doesn't the Commission act on this?
Citizens of of other EU Member States residing in Latvia may vote and stand in municipal and European Parliament elections.
But hundreds of thousands of people who were born in the country or spent most of their lives there do not enjoy this right.
I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what have thy done in order to address this issue with the Latvian authorities, and to take further action without any delay.
Thank you.
