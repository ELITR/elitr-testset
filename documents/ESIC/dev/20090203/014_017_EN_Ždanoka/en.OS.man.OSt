Thank you Mr President, dear Commissioner.
First of all I would like to thank Mr Tabajdi for his excellent work.
And it's of course regrettable that we are not able to conclude our debates with a resolution.
I am firmly convinced that minority rights must become a part of acquis communautaire .
Unfortunately, the Commission is very reluctant to suggest any measures in this field.
We should remember that minority rights are an integral part of human rights and therefore our standards must be as high as possible.
Let us not forget that respect for, and protection of, minorities is one of Copenhagen criteria.
The Commission even does not applies the criteria properly during the accession process.
We are ready to make concessions hoping that the situation would be better afterwards.
But after the accessions, there are at all no tools to address the issue, as just approved honourable Commissioner Barrot last month.
And so we have elaborate a common European Union common standard in the field of minority rights, and this is an absolute must.
