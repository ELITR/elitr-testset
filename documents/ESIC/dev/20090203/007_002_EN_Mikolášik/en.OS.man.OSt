Gracias
Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Gyula Hegyi on his dossier and and thorough research.
And in this time of global climate change and environmental troubles, it's clear that we need to address the issue of European wilderness.
I believe that it is pertinent that we coordinate a strategy for protection and restoration of our precious wild lands.
We have a responsibility to nature and of proper land use.
In my own nation country, Slovakia, an increase of bark beetle population forced the national park services in High Tatra region to use pesticides to combat the corrosive nature of the insect.
However, these pesticides will contain the chemical cypermethrin, often destroy healthy vegetation and poses serious health effects to us human and animals in the region.
Just as we must find a better solution to destroy mallignane?? insect population explosion in Slovakia, it is necessary across Europe to find ways in which to effectively protect our natural and wild lands.
I urge and I finish the European Parliament to act responsibly and quickly in order to protect the remaining wilderness.
Thank you very much.
