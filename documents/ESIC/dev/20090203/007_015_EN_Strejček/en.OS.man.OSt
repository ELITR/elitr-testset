Thank you Mr President, thank you for your patience and indulgence. And let me take the opportunity to explain why I voted against eh eh the Greens and their amendment which I don't suppose to be correct to vote over Czech Presidency. Eh point number one the Czech Presidency doesn't call for a particular change of so called Barcelonian targets. But for opening up of the debate on a possible and viable revision of the targets. The second point it's evident that there are different social, cultural and economic conditions which can hardly allow to achieve target from Barcelona generally and equally all over the EU. Third, the report doesn't take into account further factors, such as the freedom of each family, as well as interests of children. And the last one, not least, it's also difficult to achieve targets from Barcelona because the childcare is, fully in hands of national governments, which is absolutely right. Thank you very much.
