Mr Chairman, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli for her very fine report.
I think we will all support such a report.
And as has been said, it is a crime, and it should be treated as a crime.
Anybody who would attack or in any way undermine children.
Unfortunately, this is what is going on on the Internet.
The Internet is a wonderful tool, it's a wonderful source of information for all of us and something that is gonna be part of our lives into the future.
However, there are those who prey on children and they will use the Internet as much as they possibly can to try and undermine children.
About 8 out of 10 children use the Internet in the European Union and I think we got to be particularly careful to protect the most vulnerable children from bullying, grooming and harassment.
I think we need to promote public awareness and online safety, especially among children, but also with parents so that they know exactly what is going on, what can be done on the Internet.
I think Member States should work together to introduce a network of contact points for the public to reach to report illegal and harmful content and conduct.
It is important that both parents and children feel secure using the Internet and have a point of contact to report any wrongdoing.
In order to make accountable those who are responsible for online grooming and pornography, we should see this for what it is.
It is a crime and it should be treated as such.
