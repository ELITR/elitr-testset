Thank you Mr President.
We are discussing the Latvian case just because it is unique.
And the Latvian non-citizens are not nationals of any state and they have no right to participate in any elections.
And all adult bearers of the status of non-citizens of Latvia were permanent residents of the country in early 1990s
The last time possibility for them to enjoy voting rights was available 19 years ago.
That is in March 1990, when the Supreme Council of Latvia had been elected.
One and a half year later on, the very same Supreme Council deprived one third part of his own voters of their voting rights.
This is a unique case in parliamentary history.
Honourable Commissioner spoke only on integration of non-citizens into society and naturalisation.
But such an approach puts the things in reversed order.
Non-citizens are already a part of society, 32 percent of them are locally born.
For many, the procedure to apply for citizenship of their own country is humiliating and they do not go through naturalisation on principle.
For the Latvian political elite, the deprivation of basis rights of the essential part of minority population is an instrument for preserving power.
They are using the old method divide and govern, therefore, the action on behalf of Latvia's non-citizens must be taken by the European Union.
And I am convinced that fundamental values of the EU, such as non-discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin and participatory democracy, must take precedence over national competences.
Thank you.
