Thank you Mr Chair.
European legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and obtain higher standards of energy efficiency and environmental compliance.
Ecolabelling as a part of EU action plan on sustainable production, consumption and industrial policy is such a tool.
And so is EMAS, eco-management and audit scheme.
It is about striking the balance between regulatory and market-based instruments.
With the aim of developing voluntary standards for various products and services.
Or helping to optimise production processes and make more effective use of resources.
Now, the problem is how modern technologies can be used for environmental protection.
And how industry or services should be helped in promoting the environmental value of the production.
The goal of ecologic certificates is to engage synergies with other legal acts that are tackling environmental aspects of the products.
EMAS is saving resources, among them water.
From past experience we know that certificates on various levels were not sufficiently coordinated.
Existing voluntary and regulatory instruments were not linked to each other in order to establish synergies.
First revision of the EMAS scheme was not encouraging.
It was initially expected that EMAS-registered companies would have performed better.
Since the EMAS environmental requirements are tougher as compared with older and better-known certificates such as ISO 14001
Yet EMAS-registered companies were not performing better, and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the ISO 14001.
The Commission found reasons for the missing success.
Too tough, too expensive, too complex system.
And has proposed acceptable simplifications.
The rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, added valuable additional modifications.
Among them is aligning the definition of EMAS with ISO particularly important.
It would help organisations to proceed more easily from ISO to EMAS standards.
I'm confident that our amendments have made the proposal of the Commission for the regulation better and we brought it closer to users.
Impartial system of certification will be, we suppose, appreciated also by consumers.
I hope that this will help organisations to choose the most rational systemic approach in order to interconnect different fields of the environmental protection.
Thank you Mr Chair.
