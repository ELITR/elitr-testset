Thank you Mr President. From the experiences with the other issues that tackle food safety, as well as raise ethical questions linked to the relations between humans as dominant species and the animals, we know that public perception depends very much on the specific knowledge of the matter. Consumers are increasingly sensitive with regard to the suffering and injuries of farm animals. Therefore, they have to be properly informed about the risks posed by cloning of animals. An educational campaign would be needed, explaining to them how incredibly wasteful process cloning has been so far. It was expected that EFSA would not find clear safety concerns related to food pro products from clones of farm animals, compared with conventionally bred animals. However, EFSA underlined too in its recent report that the practice has major repercussions on the health and welfare of animals. The issue raises societal problems, which advise us strongly to ban animal cloning for food, as well as import of cloned animals and their offspring. Thank you.
