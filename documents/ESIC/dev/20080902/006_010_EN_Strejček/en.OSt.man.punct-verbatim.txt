Thank you Mr Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen I voted against the Bowles report. And there are three points that I'd like to stress. First, report calls for better tax and fiscal coordination. I suppose it to be harmful to tax competition, because tax competition is sound and fruitful. Second, the way to eliminate tax fraud is not a reduction of the competition but strict elimination of tax exemptions. And a third, tax frauds in VAT should be eliminated by unification of VAT rates, which will result in fast reduction of exemptions and loopholes. Bowles report offers different remedies. That's why I voted against. Thank you.
