Thank you President.
Following to my colleagues I would like to speak about the fight against discrimination.
And first of all I would like to thank the Commission for its courage coming with a horizontal approach in the draft directive on equal treatment beyond the workplace.
We have to take into account that some Member States still keep blocking the adoption of this necessary document.
Nevertheless, there is a space for the European Parliament for improvements.
I do not understand why there is an opt-out for private persons as regards supply of goods and services.
The actual Race Directive doesn't include such an opt-out.
Unfortunately, multiple discrimination is also not appropriately addressed in this draft, so I hope that we all will work on this directive further.
Thank you.
