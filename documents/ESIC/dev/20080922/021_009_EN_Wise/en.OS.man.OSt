Mr Chairman.
The overall objective of the European Year 2009 is "to promote creativity for all as a driver for innovation and as a key factor for the development of personal, occupational, entrepreneurial and social competences through lifelong learning."
But we are always talking of new legislation.
An oppugnant state mired in legislation and bureaucracy stifles creativity and entrepreneurship among its people.
Belgium, for example, is unlikely ever to produce a Joe Meek or a Richard Branson, and, let's be honest: the Singing Nun was never really on a par with The Beatles or the Rolling Stones.
As the Commission sinks into caducity before becoming lost in caliginosity, the great works of European culture will remain as knitted beacons.
Let us not stifle our artistes with any more legislation, and, as the great Ral Donner once lamented: "You don't know what you've got till you lose it, uh-huh, oh yeah!"
