Thank you Mr Chairman, I would like to raise the issue of the 4.6 million people in Ethiopia who who are facing starvation because of acute food shortages. And this has come about because of drought. And the Ethiopian Government is saying it's it's not a famine, but UNI UNICEF are saying that the sh certain parts of the country certainly famine is there and people are at acute risk of of famine. And it's only happening in certain areas, and I believe that we need to now the international community and the EU must act quickly and try to supply about half a million tonnes of food if we are to void to avoid a complete famine. I think this is a priority and, as the European Union is one of the biggest contributors to overseas development aid, I think it is absolutely e essential that we do this immediately. Eh ehm Mr President, can I just comment as an Irish Member, I want to agree with the comments that you've made about Libertas and the Irish referendum. We fought for a "yes" campaign. We were open and transparent about our funding. Libertas told us one thing, and now we've discovered it's very very different. So I want to encourage you and everybody to make sure that this becomes far more open and and transparent in the Libertas of where exactly the money came from, because people want to know.
