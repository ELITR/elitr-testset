President, dear colleagues.
The foundation of the EU rests of the principle of representative democracy.
We as members of the Parliament have a duty to make sure that Europe's policies reflect the will of citizens.
Therefore I am here now to express the wariness caused by the ever-increasing number of GMOs authorisations.
And when I do this I speak of the majority of the citizens of the European Union.
An Eurobarometer published in March of this year indicates that 58 percents of Europeans are against GMOs.
Over a third of them consider that they are not being properly informed of the benefits and risk of GMO usage in agriculture.
These figures worry us.
Instead, the Commission continues authorising an ever-increasing number of GMOs to enter the EU agricultural market.
The September 8 authorisation of another genetically-modified soya bean is but the least example.
Esteemed colleagues, in consideration of these facts I suggest we ask the Commission to start an EU-wide information campaign on the risks and benefits of GMO represent to people and the environment.
A new assessment should follow.
Until the citizens of Europe are properly informed and express their position on this very sensitive subject, I am asking the Commission to stop authorising any new GMOs.
Thank.
