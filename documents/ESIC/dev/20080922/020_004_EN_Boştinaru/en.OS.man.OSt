Thank you very much.
Mr President, dear colleagues.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done and for his very concrete proposals.
The text we have today reflects the necessity for his report to be more than a simple enumeration of the main activities carried out by the Peti Committee in 2007.
I am glad to see that the points we wanted to insist upon are in the report.
Petitions it's about bringing to light the wrong or non-application of Community legislation.
Petitions it's about guaranteeing the rights that the European Union confers to its citizens.
However, I can avoid sharing with you the feeling that this unique institutional instrument is not always effective.
Or at least not as much as it could be or it should be.
As a rapporteur, Mr Hammerstein has rightly underlined some shortcomings and deficiencies exist, and these must be addressed.
Firstly, it is hardly controversial that the number of petitions coming before the Committee it's in a constant increase.
There are substantial delays petitioners sometimes face before receiving a response or seeing the effects of proceedings.
The instruments to exert pressure on the Member States are not always satisfactory.
This is why I'm ask myself: what we can do be more efficient?
How can we ensure both effectiveness and prompt response?
We need better rules and more stringent time-frames.
We need to enhance the committee's own independent investigatory facilities.
And for this we need more resources and legal expertise for its secretariat.
The number of petitioners it's increasing steadily.
This is the voice of the European people and we cannot afford ignoring it.
Secondly, the institutionalised channel of communication with national authorities are insufficient.
The number of inadmissible petitions it's significant.
We need to establish additional coordination structures with relevant authorities at a national parliamentary and government level.
I congratulate again the rapporteur for his work, and thank him and the colleagues from the other groups for their valuable cooperation.
Petitions are about citizens fighting for their rights, their European rights.
We must be here, ready to defend them.
This is the committee's institutional role and duty.
This is what we owe to our fellow European citizens.
And I'm sure you will agree that could not be a better time to show our commitment to their their expectations.
And Mr Commissioner, the Committee is not only about visibility and making our Committee more effective in the European media.
I want to refer here.
Even is not about the 2007 report.
The very successful way in which we the Peti Committee and the European Commissioner, László Kovács, we've been working together to defend and to protect the rights of European citizens in my country of origin, Romania.
And I want to thank him.
Děkuji vám
