Thank you very much distinguished colleagues. Comparing to the budget 2009, the Commission proposal for 2010 foresees moderate increase on the budget lines concerning internal market and customs policy. Whereas the amount of money allocated to consumer policy remains stable. In the draft budget 2010, the Council has decreased the money, in particular, for budget lines which concern the development of the internal market. I believe that a functioning internal market in these times of economic crisis can contribute to the economic recovery. In the area of customs policy, the budget will assure cooperation and coordination measures, thus reinforcing security and protection of external borders, supporting the fight against illicit trafficking and fraud as well as improving the efficiency of customs systems. I consider measures in the area of consumer education a priority, in particular, the strengthening of financial li literacy. The crisis has shown how important consumer policy, in particular, consumer education, is in order to help consumers to take responsible economic decisions. For all these reasons, IMCO Committee called for a separate budget line on the SOLVIT programme to be financed by an amount of 1 million euro. A SOLVIT is a very good example how you can help businesses and citizens. And finally, for the continuation of the pilot project monitoring measures in the field of consumer policy to the consolidation of a scoreboard and related market study, as a preparatory action, the amount adopted is 1 million euro. Thank you very much.
