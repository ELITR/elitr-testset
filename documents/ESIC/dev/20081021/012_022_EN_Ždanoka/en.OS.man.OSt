President, I speak today not only as a representative of my political group and a member of the EU-Russia delegation but also as the only native Russian-speaking Member of this Parliament.
Some politicians forget that Russia is actually Europe's biggest country by population and Russian speakers are the European Union's biggest minority group, up to 10 million people.
Unfortunately, many of those speaking of Russia's resources think simply of raw materials and forget the human dimension.
We must remember that people are the basis for EU-Russia relations.
The European Union's Russian speakers favour relations between EU and Russia based on a strategic partnership.
And we support not just an EU-Russia common market, as President Sarkozy said today, but also freer movement of people.
We support human rights, also mentioned by Mr Sarkozy, but we oppose the double standards where the European Union's institutions close eyes on violations of the rights of Russian speakers in the Baltic States.
Thank you.
