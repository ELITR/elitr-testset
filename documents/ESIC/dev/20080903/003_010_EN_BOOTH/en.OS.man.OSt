... REACH Regulation now beginning to take its terrible toll on productive industry, especially on smaller businesses.
And the numbers of animal experiments rising sharply.
Here in the form of A6-140 come some more instructions from the world-government zealots of UNESCO on how to classify, label and package the results of its previous idea.
Being equally thirsty for anti-democratic global domination, the commercial and political elite which constitutes the European Union hastens to implement these instructions.
Just as they did to implement REACH.
They made a barrage of assurances of their good intentions.
Which may for the moment protect or delude their so-called stakeholders.
But which will not satisfy the great number of the unemployed which these measures are already beginning to produce.
A crumb of recognition for public opinion falls from the master's table in the form of Amendments 10, 12, 39 and 42.
To place reducing animal experimentation in certain circumstances before adherence to the letter of the legislation.
I understand that this is due to pressure from the influential environmental groups upon which the EU depends for so much of its support.
And placing the welfare of non-human primates above that of humans, as expressed in Amendment 40, is surely going too far to placate them.
But finding anything deserving of a positive vote in the oppressive and obsessive process of EU legislation is a rarity worthy of note.
For the rest, there is no reason why sensible standards of safety should not be adopted voluntarily by democratic nation states with independent judiciaries and free public access to judicial systems.
Supranational edicts may appear to be an easy option.
But the centralised unaccountable power they contribute, directive by unmandated directive, is not just their sting in the tail but their principal awful effect.
The claim put forward in recital 7 to the effect that this legislation will provide a competitive advantage to industry.
And, as Amendment 1 adds, in particular to small and medium-sized enterprises, is simply ludicrous.
As always, the EU's big business overlords will benefit from the failure of their smaller competitors.
They will become even larger fish in a smaller pond or flee abroad.
And far from kowtowing to the EU and its ridiculous restrictions, traders overseas will trade much more profitably with each other than they will with us.
The boom is over.
The recession has begun and under the burden of EU regulation like A6-140 our economies are sinking like stones.
Each traveller on this gravy train can tell his electorate whatever he likes in their own language.
Without fear that they will overhear what his colleagues in other states are telling their electors.
There is no general EU electorate and there cannot be one.
Until perhaps in a century or two everyone speaks one language.
And until that time comes EU democracy will be a joke.
And a dark and dangerous joke at that.
But your privileges are enormous.
Why should you care about this or the crazy counterproductive laws you continually rubber stamp?
And why should I care, because I am retiring at the end of this month?
When I read Amendment number 28 it made me realise why I have had enough of all this nonsense.
It says: "Preparation means a mixture or solution composed of two or more substances.
Mixture and preparation are synonyms."
Well, however would we survive without this supernanny state explaining such things to us. And how on earth have I survived to the ripe old age of 68 when I spent my infant years chewing the leaded paint off the wooden frame of my cot?
I suppose it gave my antibodies something to do in the days when we actually had antibodies.
Each leaden edict brings the collapse of the EU closer.
I rejoice in that, but I deplore the damage which you are inflicting on 27 former democracies, year by disastrous year.
Thank you.
