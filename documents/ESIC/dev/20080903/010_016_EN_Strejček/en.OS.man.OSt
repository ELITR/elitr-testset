Thank you Mr Chairman.
I voted against the Svensson's report, and thank you for the opportunity to say why.
My reasons are as follows.
First, each consumer doesn't know all, nor a legislator does.
That's why advertising is a vital part of commerce and trade.
Second, each advertising unfortunately or fortunately must be obtrusive, attractive, striking and eye-catching.
It is the result of the fact that there are always at least a few producers with the same product, and each of them wants to sell just its own product.
Third, Svensson's attempt go towards these principles and try to improve market forces with artificial legislating steps, which will harm and distort natural market forces stemming from supply and demand relationship.
That's why I voted against.
Thank you very much.
