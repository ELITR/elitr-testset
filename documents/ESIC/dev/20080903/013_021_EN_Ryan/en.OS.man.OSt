Mr President. First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and assure her that I'm we will be supporting her report. The European right Union is right to have at its disposal a tough set of political and economic instruments which can be used against regimes around the world which violate the human rights of their people. But the European Union must be very careful when it comes to imposing political and economic sanctions. The EU is the largest contributor to overseas development aid, but it must act with wisdom and prudence when it comes to sanctions. The effect of sanctions in Zimbabwe and Sudan and Burma, to name but three countries, has been very detrimental on ordinary people and in those countries. So we must try and make sure that it doesn't affect the poorest and most oppressed in these countries but it it attacks and gets after the people who are leading these countries. Some people have mentioned Cuba. I cannot understand why we have sanctions in Cuba. Cuba should be returned to normal trading and in 10 years' time Cuba would be a radically different country if we did that instead of these ridiculous sanctions on the on the place. Well, we must be careful, as I said, when imposing sanctions sanctions. And when imposing economic and political sanctions they must be targeted at those who are in charge. Let's target at their financial affairs which eh which are happening abroad or their travel ehm situation. Sanctions can be useful but they are limited and especially if they're only being used by European Union countries. UN sanctions are far stronger and can be far more effective. I support this report but I do think that sanctions are limited. Ehm but they can be effective, but we also must use prudence and wisdom when we when we imple implement them. Thank you.
