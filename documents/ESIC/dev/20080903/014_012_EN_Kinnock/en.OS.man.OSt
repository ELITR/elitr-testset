Thank you very much President.
May I at the outset thank the Commissioner very much indeed for her strong and audacious statement, which was very much appreciated.
May I also say to Mr Kaczmarek that he ought to be aware that 19 percent of maternal deaths are caused from unsafe abortions.
And surely this is something that has to be addressed, and not have any kind of pretence that it's something we can deal with in any other way.
When we focus on sexual reproductive health rights, we hear from the other side that they have problems with the vocabulary that we use in this resolution.
Apparently they don't even like the word "rights" to be used.
They don't like the word "services" to be used.
These kind of semantics I fear, would not go down very well, with the thousands and thousands of grieving motherless children in the developing world.
And with those children whose mothers have died in agony because there was no anaesthetic.
Or with a mother who bleeds to death because there is no thread for stitches.
Or a mother who dies because there isn't three cents to buy the magnesium sulphate that would save her from dying from haemorrhaging.
Tell them that the vocabulary we use in this resolution matters.
Try telling them that it all costs too much.
Those lives are precious and no woman should die giving life.
And also we also have to take into account the fact, that people say: well the reality is that women have low status and low value, therefore we can't change things.
That is absolute nonsense.
We have to change things.
We have to deal with the kind of misogyny that leads to this suffering and grief.
And we also demand change from the presidency.
We demand action from the presidency on the commitments that you have made on the MDGs.
The presidency of the European Union we liked your fine words, but we need to see more action.
Meeting MDG 5 means building health systems and ensuring that we address financially the fact that 40 percent of women globally give birth without any skilled assistance.
We look to you in the presidency to take the lead.
For instance, between 2006 and 2007 in France, your aid to Africa actually declined.
You're off track in your commitments, we need to know that you are going to reflect on the call to action and make the kind of commitments that are needed before 2010.
Will you answer whether those budgetary things...
Will you deliver that promise?
One final point.
We know that there is a need to fight maternal mortality.
We know, colleagues, how much it costs.
We sadly too know, what it costs not to do it.
We know too, sadly, what it costs not to do it.
