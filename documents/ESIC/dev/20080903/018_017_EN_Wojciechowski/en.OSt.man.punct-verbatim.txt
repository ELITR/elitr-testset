Yes, thank you Madam President, Commissioner. As the report rightly points out, ports are not only important for transport. But also provide our citizens with jobs, have a significant impact on our economies, and are strategic for the security and defence of our Member States. In terms of policy, we should primarily focus on their modernisation and development of the sector which includes all of the other logistic operations that are interconnected with ports. With the expansion of any industry, we should always keep the environment in mind, especially when our maritime and waterways are involved. And while our policy may protect the environment and the social impact, we should address the problems associated with the non EU countries which impede on our success in this sector by not applying the same rules and safeguards. Thank you.
