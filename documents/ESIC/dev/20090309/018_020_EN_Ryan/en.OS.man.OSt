Thank you Mr. President.
I too would like to welcome this report.
About 8 percent of all the new jobs in the European Union have been created by SMEs.
And in my own constituency of Dublin about 400000 people are employed by about 100000 companies in the SME sector.
We must do all we possibly can at the moment to support these companies in difficult times.
I welcome the fact that the EIB has a fund of 31 billion for small to medium-sized industries
And I think that more should be done in this area.
Also, the cutting of red tape and bureaucracy by the Commission has to be welcomed.
There's a saving for the European Union of about 2.3 million.
And recently I had a meeting with Commissioner Verheugen and we discussed with Irish business people the problems that they faced.
And one of them I think that should be looked at is that we should look at the idea maybe having a moratorium on new red tape that's coming out from Europe, because that is stifling business.
And during these difficult times, we have to do everything we possibly can to make sure that they survive to the what hopefully would be an upturn.
But that cannot only be done by Europe.
It must also be done by national governments and by local governments.
Because they themselves have a huge role to play in this.
And if we want to get our small businesses and get employment to stabilise in the European Union and in our each individual Member State, we must do everything we possibly can to try and save them.
The challenge that we have at the moment is about jobs, jobs, jobs, and we must bend over backwards to try protect existing employment and, hopefully, in the years ahead try and create new jobs.
But that is absolutely essential for all of us.
Thank you.
