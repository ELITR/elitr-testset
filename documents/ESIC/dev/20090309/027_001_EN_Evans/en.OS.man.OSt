Thank you Mr President.
European Commission produces its annual competition report.
And it is traditional for the European Parliament to cast its eye over the report and to produce an own-initiative reaction to it.
In this case, because of timing factors, the reports for 2006 and 2007 have been brought together.
But taking up one of the points mentioned by Commissioner Barrot a little earlier, it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather markedly.
Since in fact we began the exercise of considering the report some time ago.
At that time, we were focused upon the whole business of the modernisation of competition policy.
The significant amount of work taken forward by former Commissioner, Mario Monti, and by the current Commissioner, Neelie Kroes.
And looking at the impact of that in terms of the Commission's ability to deal with the abuse of market power, to deal more effectively with mergers and state aid.
By and large, that's been a very good story in these reports.
And that's very clear from the reaction that we have from Parliament's own report.
We've seen record activity on the part of the Commission in terms of dealing with hardcore cartels.
We've seen the development of the leniency system.
We've seen record fines put into operation by the Commission.
And we've seen record activity in terms of mergers and state aid notifications as well.
This is a process that is gathering pace in terms of modernisation.
Because the Commission is currently bringing forward proposals, in a White Paper, on introducing private damages.
And that's something, similarly, that our committee and the Parliament has been supportive of.
Our committee has drawn attention to two specific concerns.
What we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers, particularly in relation to food retailing.
You Mr President will recall that Parliament has, in fact, put down a written declaration on this, signed by more than half of the Members.
And also our committee has expressed some concern about abusive practices in the services sector.
But I mention the change of context because, of course, we all recognise that since the reports were published by the Commission, the Commission's work in terms of state aid particularly has really taken on a rather different dimension.
Almost on a daily basis, the Commission is now looking at the effect of the bail-outs that are taking place in the context of the great financial turmoil that
And it's very important, and our report says so, that, in addressing those matters, we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective, open market.
It's very important that, when the Commission gives its approval, it's giving that approval in ways which are compatible with the Treaty.
And do not create such significant market power in future that it becomes a scenario for abuse in its own right.
Just looking at the banking sector in the United Kingdom at the moment is one very clear area where there will have to be, when economic circumstances become a little calmer.
A general review of the new architecture that we have got and whether that architecture really is compatible with the operation of a free, fair and open market.
We have received reassurances from Commissioner Kroes in this regard.
But, nonetheless, our committee has put those pointers down in this report.
But generally our view is that the Commission is to be congratulated in its work.
And that's the thrust of the report, which I anticipate will be passed tomorrow by a very large majority.
Thank you Mr President.
