Thank you very much President. Honourable colleagues and Mr President. Thousands of grandmothers, mothers and daughters are falling of victims to breast cancer every year. Europeans in particular are affected by the disease, as the most common cancer of the European women is breast cancer, with an estimated 430000 new cases diagnosed every single year. The first step to combat this terrible disease is awareness. This month, the Europeans must focus on the early detection as the pie pri primary means of prevention. Detection is a very very strong, key issue in this, because in America, for example, 41 of American cases were diagno diagnosed at a very early stage, compared to 29 30 percent of the of in Europe. However, 1 in 10 woman in the EU will develop breast cancer before she reaches eight 80 years of age. As well as every two and a half minutes another woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. The harsh reality of breast cancer results in a woman every seven and a half minutes dying of this disease. In Europe, 132000 women died of breast cancer in 2006. This October the measure to increase breast cancer awareness, early detection and prevention must come from all the levels of deci desi descision making. Thank you very much.
