Thank you very much President.
Mrs High Representative I think you are completely echoing our feelings when you say that you were shocked.
We were indeed shocked after 19 December, as many of us had already hoped that there would be a gradual opening-up of Belarus towards the European Union.
Now I think a lot of those hopes have gone for the time being.
And it's very very worrying to hear, almost hourly, news from Minsk and other parts of Belarus of ongoing repressions.
Just yesterday, the harassment of the human rights organisation Viasna is going on, with house raids, with arrests, detentions.
And this is an organisation that has been very courageously defending human rights in Belarus.
And it has not been allowed registration by the authorities by now.
Also the Belarus Helsinki Committee has got a warning after they contacted the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers.
As they have a full reason to believe that those charged with these heavy charges are not going to be given a fair trial.
So, we also hear today news of the former presidential candidate, Mr Sannikov and his spouse, a journalist and correspondent of the Novaya Gazeta in Minsk Iryna Khalip, and their child, which has become a sensation worldwide.
We hear that may be the child can stay with its grandparents, as the parents are detained.
But I would just warn this is not a final good news.
We still have need the confirmation, which may come next week.
So why is this "strike hard" in Belarus happening?
I think we really need to insist on independent international inquiry into what happened.
To understand all the background, to understand whether there were provocateurs who actually instigated this violence, which has now been made a crime.
By those who actually only were calling for democracy in Belarus.
And in my view, the most appropriate body to conduct such an investigation would be the OSCE and if not, then the United Nations.
What about new elections?
I think we should be careful in calling for too fast new elections because we need to guarantee the road map towards democratic reforms.
We need to guarantee freedom of press, freedom of association, of assembly.
Without that, we wouldn't be gaining much, even if Belarus would have new elections today.
