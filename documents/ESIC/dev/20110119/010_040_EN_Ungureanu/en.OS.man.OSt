Thank you. Now our next speaker is Mr Ungureanu. Thank you Chairman. The Christians plight in the Middle East, Asia and Africa is no accident. This is not a series of regrettable but uncoordinated attacks. On the contrary, it is classic mass persecution. The Christians are intimidated, evicted or killed with a clear purpose: religious cleansing. And this happens as we here in Europe are bending backwards to accommodate the endless sensibilities of the Muslim believers. The result is an Europe full of mosques and the Middle East purged of Christians. But this is not about numbers. This is about liberty and about identity. Even for those among us who do not believe, Christianity should be more than a forgotten, exotic diminishing sect. We are free to believe or not, but we are not free to see our freedoms abused. This approach means that we should make religious freedom a precondition in our relations with sovereign states. This approach should be inscribed into law and become part of the High Representative mandate. Thank you.
