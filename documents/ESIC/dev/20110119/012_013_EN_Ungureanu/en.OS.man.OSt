Thank you Chairman.
Alexander Lukashenko has never missed an opportunity to prove himself a dictator.
The December elections were actually a ritual of re-appointment.
But we in the EU cling to the illusion that Lukashenko would miraculously change.
And indeed, we said: Let's wait for the December elections.
And the elections came and Lukashenko remains the same and the opposition is either in hospital or in jail.
So I think it's time for the EU to reconsider its approach to Belarus.
Clearly there is no place for Belarus in Eastern Partnership.
Belarus should be suspended.
Our only partner should be civil society.
I'm waiting for the results of the Foreign Affairs Council on 31 January and I hope that both Lady Ashton and Commissioner FÃ¼le recommend suspension.
Finally, the implications for Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, we cannot give Lukashenko a veto on Euronest anymore.
Belarus was used to block Euronest.
So the conclusion is that Euronest should be launched as a matter of urgency.
Thank you.
