Recordings of a pre-dryrun of a workshop on NLP technologies

The files ``*-with-occasional-timestamps`` are temporary files which should be deleted as soon as we create word-level timestamped transcripts (``OStt``).

The file ``asr-slt.en.OSt`` served as a homework for Ondrej's students of NPFL087. Each of the students provided:

1. ``asr-slt.en.TT*-translated-independently*``, i.e. the text translated independently of any MT system.

2. ``asr-slt.en.TT*-*-manually-postedited``, i.e. manual post-edit of the output of an MT system.

The two used MT systems were UEDIN rainbow model of ELITR and Google Translate. Because UEDIN accidentally left its output blank or non-translated, Google was manually used for that segment.

Except for Spanish, each student was native in the target language.
