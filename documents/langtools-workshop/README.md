# LangTools, a workshop on language technologies for EUROSAI

These are the dry-run sessions of 'LangTools', a workshop organized by UFAL
colleagues for the EUROSAI Congress 2020 in Prague (now sadly delayed due to
Covid-19).

The workshop is intended to present tools of natural language processing to the general public.

The workshop itself will be held in English and ELITR technologies will provide subtitles in many target languages. The purpose of this dataset is to evaluate at least the quality of the speech recognition. Translations may be added later.

## TODO

- we have the first pre-dry-run recorded, too, but not yet transcribed:
  /net/data/ELITR/data-sources/talk-level-domain-adaptation/20200210-dry-run-LangTools
- we also have the first real dry run recorded from SAO premises:
  /net/data/ELITR/data-sources/talk-level-domain-adaptation/20200212-main-sao-event-LangTools
