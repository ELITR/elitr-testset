What I would also call for, however, is to look beyond immediate concerns in Biarritz.
We, as elected representatives, are at least as responsible for encouraging it to make progress in the face of adversity as we are for relaying the messages that we receive from public opinion in each of our countries.
With an eye to recent events, the issue of petrol prices also seems to me to be particularly noteworthy.
At present, the Council is talking about incorporating such mechanisms in Article 7.
Secondly, it lies in its transparency for the public, who now know what rights they have in respect of those who create and apply European law, and in its transparency for those who do precisely that, draft or apply European law.
I agree with him that the Commission must continue to play a pivotal role as guardian of the common interests of the Community.
That is why I believe it is very important for the Chairman of the Eurogroup - which we chose to set up - to continue to play a full role in this area.
I for my part believe that it is precisely for this reason that the Convention method is a good one and that ample use should again be made of it in the future.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your kind accolade and thank you also to those who have gently reproached me for not making this speech earlier.
We must work on closer cooperation and make it simpler and more effective in order to bring this about: closer cooperation is the immediate, simplest way forward if we are to take that additional step towards integration, the need for which has been confirmed by the many powerful speeches which I have heard today.
The debate is closed.
Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 15 are acceptable in principle.
However, this reduction of Parliament's influence is acceptable given the highly technical nature of the issues concerned and the Commission's endeavours to inform the EP in good time of plans to draw up new regulations via its competent Standing committees.
It is known that in France, for instance, the figure for tax receipts varies according to whether you use the statistics of the Direction générale de la comptabilité publique or those of the Comptabilité nationale.
A policy which worked towards the rational, efficient and safe organisation of transport ought to prioritise investment in the European public rail service rather than confining itself to standardising the conditions of competition between road transporters, that are principally concerned with maximising their private profits.
These buses may have access to that country, but in practice, they will be unable to reach many places.
The report supports the Council's and Commission's approach and emphasises that a number of regulatory measures need to be introduced, namely on pensions, cross-border prospectuses and a Community patent.
The most difficult problem facing this new charter is not its actual content but whether it has legal status.
Mr President, I voted in favour of this Charter, not least because of the influence which our colleague, Ingo Friedrich, and Professor Herzog have exerted on its content.
We believe that, as a political document, the Charter is a good point of departure for this wholly necessary dialogue, which is now about to begin.
That would be an interim solution which would make it possible to work towards a binding Charter in the long term.
This Charter lags some way behind the European Convention on Human Rights, and behind national conventions or treaties.
. (FR) I voted against incorporating the version of the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have before us into the Treaties.
(A5-0244/2000) by Mr Wiersma on the Slovak Republic (COM(1999) 511 - C5-0034/2000 - 1997/2173(COS));
For this reason, it must be clear that full satisfaction of the Copenhagen criteria is the only essential point.
In this respect, I wish to congratulate the European Parliament on the work accomplished in the reform of a report devoted to each of the twelve candidate countries which have entered into negotiations, and an overall report by Mr Brok, which I shall have the opportunity to comment on in further detail in my speech.
I am, of course, thinking of the common agricultural policy and the regional development policies.
It is not, of course, impossible that the candidate countries will seize this opportunity to once again bring up, as you said, Mr President - the subject of the dates for enlargement.
Enlargement is a historic undertaking.
But success does not depend on the time factor alone, however important it may be.
And if they do not apply throughout Europe, then they are in jeopardy throughout Europe.
Chapters are opened and closed depending on the current state of preparations and actual progress in negotiations.
As far as the internal market is concerned, we must ensure that transitional periods are kept to a minimum in terms of both time and content.
We need political answers to political questions and we need to get them across properly.
Imagine how we would struggle to resolve the issue of Kosovo, Bosnia Herzegovina or our relations with Serbia in a state of cold war.
We should start with a debate involving our own people.
We will be able to support all of this and we also want to support it.
Much of our debate about fears about enlargement is based on exaggeration, but in order to confront the populists who exaggerate, we must connect with popular politics through reflection.
Our group requires target dates to be set at the Nice summit or immediately afterwards, by which negotiations on membership should be concluded.
Mr President, our Group, the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, shares many of the considerations and opinions on enlargement contained in Mr Brok' s report and we appreciate the enormous effort he has put into his courageous report.
Sixthly, we believe it has been a mistake to link enlargement in practice with the prior integration of these countries into NATO.
In company with a large number of other Members, I greatly appreciated President Prodi' s declarations and I took note of Mr Moscovici' s words when, with diplomatic caution, he too warned us not to expect much in the way of results over the next two or three months.
I would therefore ask the Minister and the Commissioner to take account of this and adjust their speaking times accordingly.
My own conclusion is that we should discuss it more, but also discuss it properly and better.
That being said, I think it was not a bad idea to ask the question.
I do not want to allow any backlogs to build up here, as has happened in other areas of foreign aid over a number of years.
But the fact remains that, as things stand today, 3 October 2000, I cannot tell you when any single country in the accession process will be ready for accession.
And I can tell you why; because these people wanted to be on the right side once and for all, i.e. securely anchored in the family of democratic nations.
Thank you very much for that clarification, Commissioner.
In that case, it will, in my view, have failed in its mission and purpose.
It is now that we are in a position to secure common values and benefits.
Imagine if such radical economic and social change had taken place in your own country in such a short space of time.
It is still hot air, Mr Verheugen; the actual agencies responsible for the project have not even noticed it exists.
The macro-economic situation is now stabilising.
This issue requires a special effort and, in my view, cannot be dealt with purely as a problem on the fringe of the issue of the accession of Lithuania and Poland.
If, for example, we place a question mark over whether it will be possible for the citizens and workers of candidate countries to move freely across the European Union right from the word go, if we want to continue to deny the citizens of Eastern Europe recognition of that right which is one of the fundamental principles of the Union, then we are further diminishing support for the difficult reforms which must take place before they can join the Union.
I was delighted that my report was adopted unanimously in committee on 14 September.
What is important to me - and my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy supported me here - is that the Copenhagen criteria, which the Czechs have also acknowledged, should continue to apply and I should like the Czechs themselves to review their own legal system, if necessary page by page, in order to ascertain if there are any laws which are discriminatory.
Now for the good news, because this actually eclipses the bad news.
I think I can say that this report, which has been duly discussed and improved upon in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy where it received unanimous approval, describes and analyses extremely thoroughly the current stage of Hungary' s path towards accession, in its dual approach to the issue.
This issue needs to be addressed seriously but within a broader framework that covers not just Hungary but also the other candidate countries that still operate this antiquated and relatively unsafe technology.
The suspicion of corruption is a most destructive force and it must be tackled as a matter of urgency.
In Romania the government, with the active support of Commissioner Verheugen, the World Bank and the United Nations, have given us an opportunity to establish good doctrines and best practice in the region.
This is a candidate country where a third of the territory has since 1974 been occupied by the Turkish army and where, because of a particularly impervious line of demarcation, the fundamental principles of the European Union cannot be applied across all of the territory.
Europe must become a responsible player in finding a solution to the Cyprus question.
Financial support under the pre-accession strategy is fundamental for Malta, as is the knowledge that financial aid for Malta should comply with the rules which apply to the other candidate countries.
Once the conditions have been fulfilled, there is no reason why either candidate countries or the countries currently members of the euro should object to candidate countries entering the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union.
You might say that I represent a region which, ten years ago, represented a good part of enlargement to the east - I too lived on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
If we are to have a common information area, we must make huge joint efforts in this sector.
Technologically too, there are still discrepancies between East and West: there are four internet connections per one thousand inhabitants over there, as opposed to sixteen over here.
In that situation, West Germany backed the former GDR financially on a massive scale, by no less than DM 150 billion annually.
The next few years in Eastern Europe might well see the depopulation of rural villages and the large-scale purchase of agricultural land for mechanised production-intensive farms.
We are building a compendium of directives and regulations on matters wholly germane to health, such as pollution, emissions of radioactive and other dangerous substances, waste disposal, water, air, soil quality, food safety and novel foods and product liability.
My report on the committee' s opinion therefore talks not only of what the candidate countries have to do but also of what the European Union has to do.
But now to the right signals.
We must ensure that the present rail infrastructure in central and eastern Europe is not replaced by road transport, resulting in a great deal of effort at a later date in an attempt to put things right.
This 'no' will now be analysed carefully in the days to come.
This is how we came to go through the text, and attempted to cut down on certain items in the process.
It makes little sense to start to doubt in public the value, including the direct value at a material level, of this enlargement.
If there is a need for long transitional arrangements on certain points, then let us have long transitional arrangements.
First, the democratic wish of the countries and people in question must be respected after their accession to the EU.
They are wrong because prosperity is not generated by the European Union and its 80 000 pages of directives and regulations.
The increasingly strong reservations expressed by our peoples and Denmark' s recent rejection of the euro serve to remind us of that.
In the opinion on the Brok report, for which I was responsible and which has been backed by the Committee on Budgets, the conclusion is the same.
This is not the most opportune moment for it to focus on foreign policy and the interchanges between the different parties could become heated and exploitative.
In splitting the body of EU law in two, the level of integration achieved by the present Member States could be guaranteed and cooperation could be further enhanced.
I visited Romania at the end of July to see at first hand the workings of one of the largest orphanages which is in northern Romania.
We therefore call upon the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council to supplement the agricultural policy section with the fisheries policy section, for example by changing the title 'Agricultural Aspects of Enlargement' to 'Agricultural and Fisheries Aspects of Enlargement' .
It is better to have a sound accession at a slightly later date than a premature one which proves inadequate.
Cyprus has close links with the people of the eastern Mediterranean and integrating the island will heighten the Union' s profile in this vital area.
I support the view of the rapporteur that Malta should be admitted to membership in the first tranche of enlargement and that negotiations should be completed by the end of 2001.
It is for us to determine a communication strategy for enlargement, through words and deeds.
In this context, it is a question of rousing public opinion in favour of enlargement.
Commissioner Verheugen' s idea of a referendum on enlargement was heavily criticised, and the reason is obvious: those who have to pay cannot be let to decide on the matter.
In the face of the twofold challenge of both the enlargement, which must enable Europe to come to terms with itself, and the institutional reform, which must increase democracy and efficiency within the institutions, the European Union now, as it often does, stands at an important turning point in its history.
Above all though, I would like to bring various expectations and reservations that I have, to the attention of the Council, which, I am sorry to say, is largely absent.
This dialogue would also contribute to the creation of the necessary administrative capacity for the effective management of the country, creating structures which do not currently exist and reducing cases of corruption.
Malta should be represented by a minimum of six MEPs, like the other smaller Member States.
Neither can we base enlargement on the idea that a given applicant naturally has priority over another as if, without it, the whole process could not start at all.
We only hope that the tremendous efforts made by the government of late will be reflected in the next Commission report.
We can use Romania to lend weight to our argument when seeking to impress on our citizens that it is in our interests to stabilise Europe.
Mr President, I come from a country, Sweden, in which there is still quite a lot of scepticism about the EU project.
The points raised by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in the Brok report are the steps we need to take to this end, and it is essential that we take them if we are to counteract any slowing of the pace on the European environmental policy front.
The SAPARD programme provides an excellent opportunity to this end, and I welcome with open arms the fact that the Commission has already approved six programmes.
My Group announced its desire to see the first negotiations concluded by 2003, making accession possible by June 2004.
I will now use my second minute to talk about Slovenia.
Mr President, there was relatively little comment regarding Elmar Brok' s idea expressed today of an arrangement similar to the EEA Agreement as an alternative for those applicant countries that do not meet the Copenhagen criteria.
The candidate countries should also be encouraged to participate in the Community programmes for equal opportunities, and particularly those concerned with violence against women.
If, however, the universally-acknowledged constructive stand of the Cypriot Government notwithstanding, this proves to be impossible due to unwavering refusal on the Turkish side, then I believe that the European Union should not allow the integration of Cyprus to be held hostage to Turkish intransigence and that, on the contrary, it should immediately accept the Republic of Cyprus as a member of the Union pending integration of the island as a whole at a later date, as happened with one of the founder members, the anniversary of the unification of which we are celebrating here today.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
If we are to preserve the balance between the institutions, I believe we must take steps to ensure that this defect is rectified.
We are discussing a serious matter.
No one does.
My report supports this.
Many of these instances of poisoning or cases in which heavy metals were dispersed occurred before there was sufficient environmental awareness and before it was known what the effects would be.
Let me make a suggestion to the Commission as to how this problem could be tackled.
The crises of recent years have made everyone, including ourselves, more keenly aware of the situation.
That is why the PPE-DE Group advocates effective controls, and we echo the rapporteur' s call for the food safety auditors in the Commission to be able to conduct unannounced on-the-spot inspections in close and constructive cooperation with the inspectorates of the Member States.
We all want the same thing and we have to say this very clearly here in Parliament.
Where heavy metals are concerned, there are many inconsistencies.
But remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the legitimacy of our Community institutions and our own legitimacy depend entirely on the will of the peoples whom it is our duty to represent.
The Commission has now proposed deleting the derogation for compound foodstuffs and having the option of fixing action thresholds below the maximum permitted limits in cases of real emergency.
Residual poison, pollution, poor animal husbandry and poor hygiene will result sooner or later in sick animals and, consequently, also in an increase in illnesses among human beings.
These directives are part of the most radical shake-up of the Community's food safety hygiene rules for at least 25 years.
I should like to conclude by dealing briefly with two problems relating to the declaration.
Moreover, in my eyes a crime is a crime!
The farmer must obviously be compensated for the destruction of a batch of feed that is so contaminated that it is unfit for use, just as in the case, for example, of the destruction of animals with TSE.
However, let me first address the amendments with which the Commission cannot agree.
This has already been done for dioxins and PCBs and it can be expected that this scientific risk assessment will become available, as I said, in October.
This proposal is the follow-up to one of my first commitments to improve food safety and provides for a system to exchange information in the field of animal nutrition, with particular reference to a rapid alert system and a legal basis to enable the adoption of safeguards measures for products produced within the Community and also the obligation for the Member States to have in place contingency plans to deal with feed emergencies.
The basic Directive 95/53 already stipulates in Article 19 that penalties for non-compliance shall be commensurate and have a deterrent effect and when a responsibility is proven in the court civil and/or criminal liability apply.
The compound-feed industry, however, has been trying yet again to exert influence through the Council and to overturn the principle of open declarations.
We need a white list of the additives and ingredients that are authorised for use in feed mixes.
I believe, too, that transparency will ultimately strengthen competition; it stands to reason that transparent competition creates a greater incentive to manufacture the best possible mixes.
We believe that complete transparency for farmers is essential.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after the issue of the composition of feedingstuffs for animals, if we are to eliminate mercury, lead, arsenic, DDT, etc., we must address the question of the way in which these products are marketed.
We must create a realistic statutory framework.
Mr President, the proposal before us and the rapporteur' s reaction to this proposal are a step in the right direction but, at the same time, they expose the weak structure of European enforcement.
I believe that reversal of the burden of proof, as proposed in Amendment No 4, is absolutely essential if these aims are to be achieved.
Finally, in relation to Amendment No 6, this amendment is not acceptable as it falls outside the scope of this directive.
When we vote on these paragraphs, I shall ask if there are any objections to inserting them after paragraph 1.
(Parliament gave its assent to considering the oral amendment ) (Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Secondly, that the candidate countries continue to make the good progress that they are making towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria and towards the full and complete enforcement of the acquis communautaire in advance of accession.
Paragraph 65 is another example of Brussels' s desire to dominate and unify, stating that the non-discrimination clause provided for in Article 13 of the EC Treaty is part of the 'acquis communautaire' and insisting that "legislation derived from this article be fully implemented in the CEECs" .
To return to the budgetary aspect, I think it is crucial that we study the budgetary consequences of such a large number of new Member States joining before the end of the current financial cycle in 2006.
It is unfortunate that the report has taken no account at all of the position and conditions of women in the adjustment process.
The opposite approach would drive a wedge through the farming community and endanger the social development of rural areas throughout Europe.
What this report is actually proposing is to enlarge an economic market.
There is a risk of the European Union being watered down politically and of social dumping, and, lastly, that the project of European integration will be reduced to the creation of one large marketplace, an area of free competition.
On paper, a great deal has been achieved in the area of equality of treatment and equal opportunities for men and women, but how do things stand in practice?
The enlargement of the European Union to include the ten countries of Eastern Europe plus Malta and Cyprus is a great project.
Secondly, enlargement inevitably involves revision of the European Union's financial perspectives, which were conceived and established before the prospect of enlargement was even on the horizon.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to announce that I voted for the measure on Estonia's application for membership of the European Union.
I note that Latvia is making progress to meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of the acquis communautaire.
I note that Lithuania is making good progress to meeting both the Copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of the acquis communautaire.
Moreover, Poland fully respects human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Regarded for far too long as the prime battleground for neighbouring aggressors, who always saw the annexation of Poland as the first stop on their expansionist itinerary, the unwilling arena for one of the most abhorrent tragedies in history, and subsequently left for decades to oppression by a totalitarian regime which, encouraged by our culpable silence, thought that it could finally quash Poland' s legendary spirit of resistance, Poland has never ceased to demonstrate forcefully the values of freedom, courage and independence, all those shared values that form the foundation stone on which our construction of a political Europe is supposed to stand.
If the Czech Republic continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why the Czech Republic should not be admitted to the Union.
Well done to the Hungarian Republic!
If Bulgaria continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Bulgaria should not be admitted to the Union.
I hope Slovenia will be in the first group of new members.
it raises the issue of the return of the refugees and the repatriation of the settlers.
This is, moreover, made clear by the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, which affirm, in the final analysis, that solution of the 'Cyprus question' is not a necessary precondition for accession.
We hope that the perspective of early membership of the EU and the easing of contacts by means of "bottom-up" communal projects that the EU promised to promote and finance can give a positive impetus to the solution of the "Cyprus question".
Deliberate violations of health, criminal and even moral codes by doctoring the laws of nature and tampering with animal species and animal physiology are conducted without being subject to any surveillance or appropriate regulations or any justified penalties.
We must effectively be vigilant in this area as animal feedingstuffs are the first link in the food chain.
In view of the past, in view of the current economic relations between the developed major powers and the poor countries of Asia, speaking of 'equal partners' for the future is, at best, a pious hope, and, more probably, a means of concealing exploitative relations behind pseudo-democratic and pseudo-humanitarian phrases.
I should point out to Members that the Council working group agreed unanimously to recommend to the Council that the type of committee in the action programme should be modified to a mixed committee, a combination of the management and advisory procedures, thereby increasing the power of the individual Member States.
I understand their concerns, but I have assurances from the Commission that NGOs will still be able to bid for funds on this and other programmes and initiatives managed by the Commission.
That is why it is quite essential for the groups listed in Article 13 to be effectively protected against discrimination.
Fourthly, the involvement of the two sides of industry.
It has been brought home very strongly to me how we much need one in the light of the Article 13 hearings.
Indeed, equal treatment is a fundamental constitutional right which forms one of the cornerstones of the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the budgetary pressures that exist within category 3 expenditure, which includes this and other programmes.
The exception of a difference in treatment which may be made on ideological or religious grounds or for reasons of age must bring together the law which protects certain public and private organisations with scrupulous respect for the principle of equal treatment.
Regarding the specifics of the report, I would like to thank Mr Mann who took on board most of the comments from the Committee on Industry, particularly those concerning multiple discrimination - as in the case of women, who are the target of other discrimination.
We heard them years ago on equal pay for women, we heard them on all equal opportunities legislation, on improvements in maternity leave, we heard them in connection with the race directive before the summer, and so we should carry on regardless.
It touches upon the theme of pluralism, the importance of which to the proper functioning of our democracy is recognised by many.
I would, in fact, like to seize the opportunity also to congratulate Mr Cashman, because although directives are important, action programmes are, of course, essential too in terms of the support they lend to directives.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both rapporteurs have done an excellent job, for which I want to thank them here on behalf of my group.
We are therefore extremely confused regarding this point, and we call upon the Commission to ensure, when monitoring the ways that the funding is used, that Turkey is not merely pretending to wipe out or combat more minor forms of discrimination without making any effort at all to fight that basic discrimination which, when all is said and done, is at the root of a great many of Europe's misfortunes.
Managerial and executive staff will give corporate shape to this belief.
I think that would create greater uncertainty because we would no longer know who could actually be assisted in line with the Commission programme.
Mr President, Commissioner, our group has evaluated both reports with positive results and would, in particular, like to emphasise the fact that we have all focused on the need to expand the programme's scope with a series of amendments - which, in actual fact, have led to another survey on discrimination - intended to guarantee equal treatment to all people, irrespective of their sex, race, ethnic origin, religion, personal convictions, age or sexual orientation.
The aim of this work, based on Article 13, is to make equality of opportunity a reality by removing that smiling face that so often cloaks prejudice and bigotry, predominantly in the workplace.
Article 5, as it currently stands, has been criticised for seeming to justify what it aims to combat.
On the other hand, however, for forty years there have been texts in existence which are actually based on discrimination.
In general terms, I agree with the emphasis placed on the development and growth of cultural tools to fight discrimination: in my opinion, we must combat discrimination with a culture of non-discrimination, making up-to-the-minute, accessible information available to all the citizens of all the Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as is well known, many forms of discrimination still remain in the European Union, specifically in employment and professional activities, even though they are prohibited under Article 13 of the EU Treaty.
I welcome this directive as the first-ever EU law introducing Europe-wide rights for our 37 million disabled citizens, an end to the back-door route to legislate for disability rights and a tribute to the disability movement which has campaigned for this day.
That is what differentiates some benches from others.
Otherwise, the initiatives will not succeed in the real world.
Lastly, the European Parliament must be kept informed, taking account of the reports and opinions produced by this House, and we must highlight the importance and necessity of truly making use of the opinion and participation of the NGOs and associations - and providing them with the necessary resources - since they are without doubt the key to the success of the measures adopted.
The provision according to which the notion of professional, essential and crucial requirement may justify exemptions on the grounds of religion is not, in my view, acceptable.
The civilisation we share asserts its greatness through respect for the rules of an open, tolerant and liberal society, with its inclusive and multicultural dynamics.
As you know, last November the Commission proposed a broad package based on Article 13 with two directives and a programme.
In short, therefore, I can accept either as drafted or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 18, 21, 41 to 45, 47, 50, 58, 59, 62, 64, 65, 66 and 67.
In my view, with these two additions, the scope of the proposal becomes clear.
I would like to refer in detail to those amendments which I cannot accept because they present political or legal difficulties.
This directive must be part of the social acquis in the applicant countries.
Furthermore non-EU countries are queuing up to associate themselves with the code.
I wholeheartedly welcome these developments.
I urge all other governments to do the same.
That is also why it opposed those of the amendments tabled by our fellow Members in order to demand planet-wide general disarmament, with the European Union to set the example.
The proliferation of light weapons remains disconcerting, even close to home, in the Balkans, for example.
Sweden does not believe that activity within CFSP can be described as a defence policy because it does not involve any common defence obligation corresponding to NATO' s paragraph 5.
The EU code of conduct establishes a set of detailed principles governing conventional arms exports.
The European Union is committed to combating the destabilising accumulation of small arms in many parts of the world.
May I thank the rapporteur again for his excellent report, which provides a great deal of useful guidance on how to develop our policy in this extremely important area.
Such areas would be pinpointed by applying criteria for defining this added value in terms of creating rankings and exclusion.
But to date there had not necessarily been any form of ranking or factors dictating exclusion.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his introduction but I am still left with a few questions.
You, who have experience, will perhaps say that this has already been stated several times.
Lastly, I would like to reply to Mr Piétrasanta, who I thank for his intervention and constructive intent.
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for being here today and for your statement.
With regard to social and economic research, it is quite clear that there is a place for this.
I would also like to state my concern at the very low level of commitment of Cohesion Fund appropriations at the end of August - only 16%, Mrs Torres Marques - and, while things have changed for the better since the end of August, I would like to reiterate this concern, which I shared with Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 11 September.
But I think, Mr Barnier - and I am sorry to say this - you are not very well informed.
Could you give us the figures for Spain and Greece?
However, this proposal instead met with heavy protest from certain Member States.
If the fuel costs of a company like that are more than double those of multinational companies with other bases elsewhere in Scotland which can bid for the same contracts, obviously this severely distorts competition, to the disadvantage of outlying communities.
Given the Community's commitment to meeting its Kyoto commitments, I wonder whether the Commissioner would accept that the best way of doing so is by higher fuel duties, as opposed to raising the other transport costs.
If the Commission has no instruments to influence levels of excise taxes in Member States, and if favouring certain industries is not allowed under the competition rules, surely where a region suffers special disadvantages because of peripherality and remoteness, it would only be a case of equalising matters, not of giving any special preference if there was some differential in excise taxes permitted in those special and particular circumstances?
While no amount is specifically set aside for minority languages as part of these activities, this does not prevent these programmes being used for that purpose.
I will answer the questions from Mr Sacrédeus and Mrs Theorin on the same subject together.
I wonder if the matter has been shunted backwards and forwards between different EU Commissioners without anyone in the end taking real responsibility for the issue.
Every year, more than one million children are forced into prostitution.
As regards compensation, the Member States and the Commission take the view that the public authorities and the private economic operators will each bear the costs of the changeover in their respective fields.
Mr President, very briefly, 11 countries have accepted the euro.
The Professional Hunters' Association would play an important role in ensuring that the hunters have the qualifications to make such a judgment.
Concerning France, the Commission is waiting to be informed about the actions taken by the competent authorities regarding some of the recommendations of the FVO mission report, especially of the action taken to ensure that route plans are properly used and signed.
I would like the Commissioners to say a little bit more about the specific issue of infringement proceedings against Italy.
The Commission services are currently preparing a draft Commission directive covering these issues and including cotton seed.
This is a matter which, strictly speaking, falls largely within the competence of my colleague, Mr Liikanen.
Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for that information and for some signs of progress in the study of this issue.
The Spanish Prime Minister - Mr Aznar - is to make an official visit to that country in October.
I join with the honourable Member in expressing my admiration of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow members of the NLD.
The living conditions of people in Burma, thanks to the appalling government under which they suffer, are bad enough as it is and I would not like to do anything that made those living conditions worse.
I hope that we will be able to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to them, but obviously what is most important - this would encourage them to return from Bangladesh and from other countries in the region - what is most important is that there should be a political settlement which recognises those rights as well as the rights of those who were democratically elected over ten years ago and whose election was swept aside by the generals.
When I was in Kosovo the other day I was very struck by those who told me that the initial stages of the election campaign had been conducted with considerable professionalism and style.
That concludes Question Time.
There should be in-depth multilateral consultations before one country can grant a licence that another has rejected.
The technology and expertise that is available should be used for something constructive in society, something that will benefit people rather than something that is going to annihilate and destroy people.
The supervisory mechanism must above all be extended to the light, small calibre arms used in a great many regional and ethnic conflicts throughout the world, which are often turned against the civil and military personnel of EU countries.
Mr President, I am pleased to see so many members of the public here today because, as everyone up there can see, there are very few people down here at this time of night.
While our committee welcomes the broad gist of the Commission's proposal, my report presents a number of changes which must be made in order to make the proposed separation of powers work.
One of the problems Parliament has faced in recent years is a lack of standardised information on financial control from the institutions.
" The Commission's challenge will be to convince Parliament that it can create those safeguards.
Result: the new director may come from the outside, but he immediately finds himself ensnared in a system that is already firmly established.
In our view, there is one note of discord in the report, although this is not the view of the entire group, and that is the question: should internal control only be set up in respect of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, or should it also extend to smaller institutions?
We expect great gains from that.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr van Hulten on this very thorough report, which has deservedly received the unanimous support of the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
If even the slightest impression could arise that the controller might no longer be independent, that is reason enough for us to split this function again.
So I can only underline again that we have developed a very accurate procedure for checking whether the individual Directorates-General that are to be responsible for this ex ante control in future are in a position to conduct it.
I would also like to point out that Article 22, Paragraph 2 of the directive explicitly specifies that all the Member States must take appropriate measures to ensure that broadcasts by television broadcasters do not include any programmes which might impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular programmes that contain pornography or gratuitous violence.
We do not intend to replace anyone who is doing a good job at national level, but we do want to introduce common criteria and minimum requirements at Community level and propose rules that help people effectively to implement measures to protect minors in their country.
Technical measures to control television offerings cannot resolve these problems.
In his splendid major speech yesterday, President of the Commission Romano Prodi mentioned that, for the sake of the EU' s political legitimacy in the future, it will be necessary to produce a list of those subjects the EU is to deal with and those which the Member States are to deal with.
Mr President, Commissioner, our children access and use televised, printed and new media on a daily basis and as a matter of course.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one Sunday evening a fortnight ago in the South of France, Johan, aged 17, and Robert, aged 16, murdered their childhood friend, Romain, with a firearm and a baseball bat, for no reason or motive, just like on TV.
Children will very quickly learn to manipulate these filtering systems better than ourselves.
The Commission will respond to this invitation because, as you know, we are due to table the 'Television without frontiers' directive again in 2002, with a view to testing the water.
We have to ensure that the experiences of young people - students and others in the educational world - are positive.
I therefore hope that, this time, a solution will be found once and for all, so that mobility throughout the European Union - of students, young persons undergoing training, young volunteers, teachers and trainers - will become one of the crowning glories of the European Union, putting paid to that paradox whereby it is easier for goods, capital or services to move within the European Union than it is for the citizens themselves.
I lament the fact that, as a consequence, young people are prevented from gaining experience - study, work or other experience - in another Member State.
I hope that the main amendments adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport will be received positively by the Council, as they deserve to be, and that legislation is speedily brought into effect.
Freedom of movement for persons, goods, services and capital is enshrined in our treaties and yet young people, who are the future of the European Union and perhaps have fewer prejudices than some of us adults are denied opportunities because of the bureaucratic barriers put in their way.
Universities that do not comply, however, must forfeit their subsidies.
Precisely for that reason I am still very surprised to see how many obstacles remain to greater mobility and flexibility in Europe.
So, in spite of the persistent problems, of which I am aware, these programmes are of positive value and contribute something to the people of Europe.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Reding.
At Leipzig on 6 July, you issued a call for a vision for the future of Europe, based on a draft constitution.
I would like to congratulate the President of the Commission on his speech and I welcome his authoritative mention, in this Chamber yesterday, of the role, collegial nature and managerial capacity of the Commission.
Lastly, we must provide the countries and peoples of South-East Europe with the hope that they will be able to penetrate the institutional bounds of the Union.
Today, I am here to talk about balanced participation by men and women in all areas of society.
The Beijing Platform for Action and the final outcome document of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Beijing + 5, last June, are along the same lines.
To give you a couple of examples: at the Education Council there is the issue of mobility of men and women students and teachers, because we have recognised that there is major inequality in mobility; and at the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council there is an item on the development of electronic commerce so as to make it accessible to all, both men and women, because we know there is gender inequality in electronic commerce too.
The first is devoted to the general principle of the equality of all persons under the law.
I would therefore prevail upon the President-in-Office of the Council, both the current and the forthcoming ones, as well as upon the Commissioner, to be alert to this aspect, for I believe that it is absolutely fundamental to our work that we make a very big effort in this area.
If one examines women' s equality policy now, it seems to me, as we are all gathered here - and, of course, most of the people attending and taking part in the discussion are women - that while we are all naturally trying our utmost, we are also aware that European women' s equality policy is threatening to lose its momentum.
Some problem areas: women often have two jobs, unemployment is higher among women, childcare has deteriorated, there are too few women in decision-making positions, violence against women is on the increase in many candidate countries and several candidate countries are at the centre of the increasing trade in women.
Péry spoke of the importance of reconciling work with family life.
We need to be sure that what is decided in Strasbourg is real progress.
Instead of addressing everyone, we compartmentalise: minority after minority, ethnic group after ethnic group.
Other Members of this Parliament had to take up the pen to put things right, and Poland thanked them for it.
Bringing up children, especially transferring standards and values, is of vital importance to our society.
Firstly, improvements are called for in the existing directives, for example those covering equality of opportunity in the sphere of social security, with respect to public and company schemes.
I was the rapporteur in Peking and the co-rapporteur in New York.
I would support the request of the Committee on Women's Rights in this report for a major study of women in the EU and in the candidate countries as a starting point for future work.
On other words, we need a breakdown of the indicators applied, detailed statistics comparing the situation in the Member States, an analysis of cultural differences in the various European societies and an indication of the factors which act as disincentives to the developments we are seeking and to the development of a European nationality for women which, as we can see on a daily basis, for example from the recent referendum in Denmark, is a sector which we need to address.
This is therefore an incredibly important issue for us to get to grips with.
Mr President, I would like to thank both Mrs Péry and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for being here today.
Mr President, I will not reply individually, except to Mrs Torres Marques, because her question is really direct and personal.
Fourth point: the issues of the future.
Secondly, because they allow us to make a comparative assessment of the Member States and a comparative assessment of the overall progress of the European Union over time.
I should like, once again, to thank Mrs Dybkjær for the excellent, in-depth work contained in her report, which will be most useful to us in our next report, and I should like especially to thank the French Presidency and Mrs Péry for being so pro-active on the issue of equality during their presidency.
Three of them - Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 7, referred to the commitology procedure.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as the rapporteur pointed out, accepted that approach, and therefore decided not to re-introduce the amendments.
Therefore, while recognising, as the Council and the Commission have said, that this amendment was not appropriate in this case, I would like to, once again, take the opportunity to point out that the procedures for monitoring imports in the European Union are not working, that fraud is being committed and that this fraud is not only bad for Community taxpayers, but also for the functioning of the internal market, and even for loyalty to third countries.
This opens the door to a major reform of economic customs systems, on which, in fact, Parliament will be informed in detail in the next couple of months prior to approval.
Yesterday the whole position changed with the position the Commission has taken on the legal base.
Mr President, we are delighted to welcome you to the European Parliament and we hope you enjoy your visit.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
European rights of citizenship do not seem to carry much weight in this situation.
This is more than a symbol; it is a reason, a driving force, for belonging to the European culture and model we are proclaiming.
Mr President, I was prompted to vote for the Cashman report by the words of the Chairman of the Pensioners' Association of the municipality where I live - Curno, in the district of Bergamo, Italy - who said to me, 'We have absolutely no way of safeguarding the interests of the elderly.
They have risen above party politics and shown that, when an amendment is right, they will support it, whoever the author.
The provision for derogation on religious grounds on the basis of the notion of essential and direct occupational requirements carries the risk of broad interpretation.
In parallel, the amendment extending the exception to the principle of non-discrimination to the wider 'social' activities of religious organisations, where the discrimination is solely based on religious conviction and on no other grounds, is a reinforcement of the specific nature and original contribution of these structures as compared with public or private services.
One could not help but wonder if common sense had always prevailed in the drafting of certain, no doubt well-meaning, proposed amendments that were now before us.
The EPLP has voted for the Mann report on equal treatment in discrimination because it is firmly committed to the principle of combating unjustified discrimination and is broadly supportive of the overall objectives behind this proposal.
We are concerned about the inclusion of health, social security and assistance as there are considerable national differences in how these matters are handled and whether they form part of the employee/employer relationship.
" Thanks to the action taken by a "whistle blower" and the Committee of Wise Men, corruption has been brought out into the open.
We, in Europe, along with our colleagues across the globe, have to see that the mistakes and greed of the past are not repeated.
The report sees arms export controls primarily as a method of avoiding awkward situations for Europe' s military industry and not as a way of achieving disarmament and peace.
- (SV) It is good that the European Union wishes to implement a code of conduct to restrict arms exports.
Report Angelilli (A5-0258/2000)
Under the provisions of Article 22b(2) of the 'Television without frontiers' directive (Directive 97/36/EC of 30 June 1997, amending Directive 89/552/EC), the Commission was required to conduct an inquiry into the advantages and possible disadvantages of measures designed to facilitate control by parents and educationalists over the programmes minors can watch.
Any further analysis of specific technology such as filtering systems will have to take account of the advances in technology which are evident today.
Encouraging industry to move in this direction through international collaboration and increasing parents' , teachers' and children' s awareness will act as a catalyst.
Finally, I invite the Member States to pursue the dual strategy advocated at Community level, involving mainstreaming and specific actions for women.
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Therefore, I think that if the European institutions and the European Parliament help the Peruvian people at this difficult time, we could contribute to the stability of the country and to the consolidation of democratic institutions across Latin America.
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the events in Peru are evidence of the world of difference that there can be between the formal meaning of words and their tangible weight.
In order to avert a disaster, it is absolutely crucial that Europe takes its politics to the American sub-continent as well.
B5-0789/2000, by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Afghanistan;
It appears as if it is simply a question of groups of men who find themselves in a world in which nothing else counts but their own solidarity and their own oppression of women.
In other words, the conflict is far more complex, there is no solution in the offing and yet, as we all agree, there is an urgent need for one.
So peace, stability and respect for rights can only be re-established through a political solution.
Other Members have already spoken of a million displaced people, a million people mutilated by landmines, thousands of women deprived of their most basic rights, such as the right to education, health, work, or to move around freely: it must be terrible for many of these women, who are accustomed to education, to a secular way of life, to be confined to that area with no freedom.
As long as the Taliban leadership continues to be as ambiguous in its statements on opium cultivation as it has been hitherto, the Commission refuses to support any anti-drugs projects in Afghanistan.
But as Mr Linkohr was saying, the problem with Latin America is that we only concern ourselves with these countries when there are problems.
Since then the situation has got even worse for the community there.
B5-0779/2000, by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members, on Macedonia;
Unfortunately, it was, of course, the case that the problem was not resolved under the last government, in the run-up to 1998.
That is a real step forward for Macedonia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group proposes to support the present motion, which we have also signed, because I believe it is right for the European Union to support the solution that has been found in Macedonia and which accommodates the Albanian population.
That is why the Commission has repeatedly urged the Macedonian Government to resolve the outstanding problem of higher education in the Albanian language.
B5-0791/2000, by Mr Korakas and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the sinking of the vessel 'Express Samina' .
In deference to the House' s decision the other day, we sat round the table and thrashed out a joint text which, I admit, was only made possible by the cooperation and good faith of all the groups.
I should like to say, as far as the resolution is concerned, because there are a number of amendments, that my amendment on shipping registers is covered in the text, it is already there.
In the cut-throat world of tendering, all too often companies can be pushed into cost-cutting measures and I would not like to see safety measures being sacrificed.
It is particularly tragic since this tragedy can also be put down to the lifting of EU legislation.
It is the Commission' s job to monitor the practical application of this legal framework within its remit as set out in the Treaty.
It seems to me that a curious discrepancy is starting to take shape.
I will not hide from you the fact that the situation is not easy, and that we are going to experience a certain degree of tension in the next few days, but everyone needs to keep calm so that the situation does not develop into a serious conflict.
The victory has been won, although the regime has made and continues to make huge efforts to forestall it.
We cannot be harsh enough in condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force.
At the moment, we have the Belgrade Parliament in flames - we know what setting a Parliament on fire means in the context of European history, and we know the responsibility held by leaders that lead their people to disaster.
In another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes, an ambulance driver was shot in the foot from a ten centimetre range as he was trying to come to the rescue of some people. The most shocking of all is the fact that the Israeli police and the army used fragmentation bullets.
But the rights of the Palestinian State are no less important.
The events of the last few days demonstrate exactly how fragile the peace process is.
Such a situation requires tact.
Once again, there is confusion between, on the one hand, a democratic State doing its best to deal with an extremely difficult situation and, on the other, the institution at the heart of Palestine which, under provocation certainly, immediately takes up arms to shoot at the Israeli forces of order.
The Commission and the Council will do their part and that is what is currently at the top of the agenda in Yugoslavia and that is what we have been interested in all along.
I would also like to say - and this is more of an appeal to the Council, but I am sharing it with the Commission and Parliament for now - let us not just make fine declarations with regard to the aid which we will soon be willing to grant to Serbia, but let us also make room for this cause in our own budget, the European Union' s budget, so that we do not end up concluding that we can only help Serbia by taking funding away from other projects in the Balkans which need our support.
That was the latest at 17.53 hours.
Especially with regard to the committee of inquiry, I would like to stress the fact that it should be an internationally constituted committee of enquiry and that its competences must be clearly delineated.
Secondly, the euro is an artificial currency and it would be a disaster to make a complete changeover to the euro in the present circumstances.
Parliament must today decide a very simple matter: whether Croatia should join that group of countries to which the European Investment Bank may grant loans with an EU guarantee.
In the budgetary procedure for 2001, our political group has maintained a strategy of pursuing a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanisms for monitoring its performance.
Hopefully, the signs of hope in Croatia and now also in Yugoslavia will encourage us to find a solution to the problems of the budget and its financial perspectives.
Having spoken fine words yesterday and having granted this guarantee today, the European Union cannot afford to arrive in Belgrade empty-handed tomorrow.
Croatia started building a democracy as long as ten years ago.
To this end, we must at last conclude an Association Agreement with Croatia, which will spell out that this is a European country that has a definite future as a member of the European Union.
This is why it would be useful to make the necessary arrangements at this stage.
In the feasibility report on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, compiled in May 2000, the Commission reaches the conclusion that the conditions for taking up negotiations with Croatia have been fulfilled.
After many years of difficulties for this people - all kinds of difficulties - we are at last, extremely democratically, beginning to welcome Serbia back into the community of the peoples of the European Union.
Are there any further comments on the Minutes?
I should like the European Parliament to take note of these violations and, of course, to call for repeat elections in Himara.
Madam President, there are more victims of ETA, but there are also more victims of the Spanish repression: more arrests, more people tortured, new dispersals of political prisoners jailed in the Basque country.
I think applying the minute rule is the least damaging solution, in the final analysis, as we have, in fact, seen.
As for Mr Le Pen, what an affront to the dignity of the European Parliament and for any true democrat to hear Mr Le Pen using the word 'dignity' !
We would, however, like to request that it be deferred for a third time for political reasons.
We are doing exactly the same as we have already done in the case of forest and plant material, i.e. we are making reference to the horizontal directive.
And I am quoting word for word from the letter dated 17 May that you yourself, Madam President, read in plenary.
Personally, I was not able to intervene to condemn these actions in that it concerned members of my own party who have always been political targets, and my involvement would therefore have appeared exploitative.
We must be able to see where progress is being made; this progress must be measurable and the social agenda must be afforded centre stage in the political discussion at European level.
I am convinced that Europe will only be social when a social dimension is added to economic policy, competition policy, external policy and the entire enlargement discussion.
Before going any further, I should like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker, and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and its chairman, on the report before us today, which testifies to the dynamism and great commitment of the European Parliament to the social agenda.
We are particularly committed to the objective of full employment.
Let me just mention the mobility of workers.
We have also managed to bring about a few things in the social sphere, but not everything, and this was because the Treaty of Amsterdam had not taken effect at the time; so, in this light, the social action programme or this social agenda is of particular significance.
In its communication, the Commission has found a framework for the social agenda which I think admirably reflects the spirit of the Lisbon Summit.
The urgency of the social situation and the need to defend the European social model call for initiatives that aim to establish rights: the right to an income, the right to a wage, the right to decent pensions for all within the European Union.
I believe that the impetus must come from below and that it is a question of providing aid at a problem level.
The priority was given to setting up a common market, with the principle of the free movement of property, goods and capital, the establishment of rules governing competition between firms and state aid.
However, the report says something slightly different: whereas Lisbon calls for a reform of the social model, it calls for reinforcement; whereas Lisbon calls for liberation of enterprise and more flexibility, the report proposes four new or amended directives and a number of legislative initiatives.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two people here today who deserve special congratulations, one being Anna Lancker, for her outstanding report, and the other being Anna Diamantopoulou, for her outstanding submission.
I think that there is also a great advantage, if we succeed in getting the directive applied, modified and updated, with regard to maternity leave: for women to receive help during maternity and for maternity to be protected when women have to continue working during that period.
Social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis.
These two political approaches underpin the entire content.
The problem is that, because of the legal basis which it has in the Treaty, the social agenda does not constitute a set of laws, a set of directives with specific steps for the Member States.
This work has gone quite quickly despite the fact that it took a little time at the beginning.
I am saying this so that no mysterious or technical procedures cause this to be misunderstood, for no less than seven different amendments in the same spirit have been tabled.
Problems to do with access to social security must be looked at on a case-by-case basis to this end.
It encompasses all those areas where action is needed and, if successfully coordinated, could make a real difference to women in all aspects of their everyday lives.
In this area, as in many others, it is essential for public authorities to exercise true pluralism in selecting their associates.
Equal access and full enjoyment of social rights for women and men, which would mean ensuring that the legislation is applied in the social sphere in terms of maternity leave, maternity protection, working time, employment contracts, etc.
That would be the logical way to implement the gender mainstreaming concept.
Mr President, I think it would be a great shame if Nicole Péry were not also to seize the opportunity to state her opinion now that she is here, so that we might hear her points of view, too.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
That is not good enough.
The single market is essential in terms of promoting the interests of consumers.
I will cite one of several examples, and it is one that is currently the subject of intense debate in other regions besides my own.
Certainly, a good deal has happened in the last 200 years or so, but we have the same aspirations today.
And, naturally, these are clearly statements to which the ears of the various Ministers for the Treasury in Europe are extremely sensitive.
On a final note, we need a more precise definition of the relevant market because, increasingly, the market is not the national market.
In future we must remember that there are national aid schemes, in respect of internal competition, for example, which are especially important and valuable in countries with low population densities and where distances are long.
Against this background, you have reworked a communication on services of general interest and set out the legal situation once again.
Mr heartfelt thanks to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her valuable contribution as rapporteur of the XXIXth report on competition policy.
Particular attention was paid to the concerns expressed by Parliament regarding renationalisation and legal certainty.
What we have to work together for is to gradually establish in the marketplace the reality of a single market going beyond the national market.
And so I only spoke on behalf of my Group, and not for Parliament as a whole.
The aim of this Commission report is to provide a basis for examining the single facility providing medium-term financial support and for revising it, should this prove necessary.
The next item is the report (A5-0195/2000) by Mrs Klass, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine [COM(2000) 59 - C5-0090/2000 - 200/0036(CNS)].
This is a clear indication that the European Parliament would, indirectly, give the green light to GMO experiments in the field of vine propagation or improvement.
We have reason to believe that the new or updated terms of the proposed directive offer a satisfactory response to the expectations of workers in the vine nursery and wine-growing sector and that they should contribute towards improving the quality of the proposed material and make it easier for the competent authorities to supervise the movement of vine cuttings and plants carried out by the institutions responsible for this.
While the Commission appears to be overcome with combined GMO and cloning fever, Mrs Klass goes further and goes into convulsions, compounding the GMO issue with all the genotypes she sees all around her.
Lastly, we can accept Amendment No 27, tabled by both Mr Lavarra and Mr Garot.
Madam President, I see from Item 13 of the Minutes, entitled 'Communication of the announcement of the removal of Mr Le Pen from office' , that you presumed to speak on behalf of Parliament, and that the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs presumed to speak on behalf of that committee.
You can check it in the verbatim report of proceedings.
As to the IGC, I believe that work at ministerial level had already progressed as far as it could before Biarritz, and this Informal Council thus came at the just the right time to consolidate certain advances and to lay down guidelines for the final phase of the work, on which we have now embarked.
Both options remain on the table, and must be assessed in the light of their potential for ensuring that the common interests of the Community are safeguarded.
The European Union has honoured its commitments and responded to this political turnaround at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 9 October, at which it decided to lift the sanctions, including the oil and air embargoes, imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998, with the exception of course of sanctions directly aimed at Mr Milosevic and his entourage.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must find a solution to these two issues, which will in fact only be resolved when negotiations are complete, and on which we must reach total agreement if that agreement is to mean anything at all.
This was a positive signal.
The President-in-Office of the Council has spoken of the spirit of Nice.
This is an important topic for current and future Member States.
Madam President, firstly I praise the European Council for accepting the draft Charter as definitive.
I would also express the wish of my Group and of a good many NGOs to see the Charter evolve and continue to improve, in order to guarantee, amongst other things, more effective protection and rights for the citizens of the European Union, for employees, for the citizens of third countries and for the socially marginalised.
This is the only way to restore a true balance between the various institutions of the European Union.
One might have expected somewhat better weather conditions, but I feel that the climate inside the European Council, at which I was present from start to finish, was a little better than the Commissioner has said.
The objective is truly one of strengthening the Community framework.
It is the first European Union document that the citizens can consult without feeling completely alienated from its content.
In any event, Madam President, I believe that Biarritz has contributed something very positive, and that is the unanimous approval of the Charter.
That is the reason why we hear so much talk of smaller and larger states.
There is a pressing need to equip the Union with a point of reference based on the content of this Charter.
As a result, we negotiated on an a minima basis and we have a minimal Charter, particularly as regards social rights.
We all know that enlargement of the Union cannot take place until decision-making procedures within the key institutions are reformed; however, such a reform process must be fair and balanced.
Our debate today also has the same ring to it.
Progress has also been made with Article 7 on combating violations of the basic values of the European Union.
A further point is the Commission reforms.
If they were to be complied with, the large countries' demands for increased power in the Council and Parliament would upset the whole balance within the EU and mean that the small countries would have to pay for the whole cost of enlargement.
The dramatic developments in the Middle East have of course caused a huge backlash and emotions among the European public and here in Parliament have inevitably run high in the wake of the violence of the past few days and the large number of victims - and rightly so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that Mr Barón Crespo has not remained in the Chamber after pointing the finger at the political force which I represent.
We should also take a look at our own situation, however.
We must recognise that the smaller States are on an equal footing with the larger ones in this Union of States, and that we must find other ways to redress the balance for the larger States.
I gather that the document was well-received at Biarritz and that it can be adopted following a number of legal clarifications and subject to an official declaration at the Summit in Nice, to be incorporated at a later stage in the Treaties.
The question we must answer is whether all the countries will have a Commissioner at the same time, and thus whether we are to have a big - and one day a very big - Commission that will inevitably have been restructured, or if they are all to have one Commissioner but not necessarily at the same time.
I have specifically mentioned some of the factors that will enable us to ascertain immediately whether the reform is sufficient or not.
Oral Question to the Commission (B5-0543/2000) pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure, by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on Article 158 of the EC Treaty concerning island status.
With peace guaranteed, Western Europe has started to attend to business in search of prosperity.
We want a proper constitution.
Finally, we need reinforced cooperation that is open, not closed, and which includes rather than excludes those current or future members that do not sign up immediately - a form of reinforced cooperation that acts as an impetus instead of creating further obstacles.
We are not asking for anything specific or tangible; we are not asking for funding: we are simply calling for this principle of island status to be universally accepted, so that the citizens of the European Union can all start the race on an equal footing, with equal chances of reaching the finish line.
Hence, it will not be easy to say that everything is going ahead just as if the fifteen Member States were involved, if you will forgive me belabouring such an obvious point.
I feel we cannot talk properly about a constitution and plan ways to draw it up until we know what we want to put in it.
Several Members of this House, but also representatives of Member States have already pointed out that the traditional method of the Intergovernmental Conference was certainly not the best method.
As for the idea you suggested of introducing this debate into the IGC, frankly, Mr Segni, it seems to me that, taking account of the scope and difficulty of the other subjects on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference, it would be more appropriate to rectify the text according to the procedures laid down by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, as in previous cases of clerical errors in the articles of treaties, in order to standardise the different language versions of this article quite precisely.
Then there would no longer be any preliminary work at all on our part.
On the other hand, it must not constitute a barrier to trade or precipitate splits in the common market, breaks in the links of solidarity and cohesion between the Member States or, as Commissioner Barnier has said, an unravelling of the Community acquis.
Following the Nice Summit, which we all hope will be successful, it is important to take this next step in order to create a more democratic Union.
I shall now do what I can to convince my fellow countrymen to run with the ball during Sweden' s Presidency.
After all, it is unacceptable for the fifteen Member States alone to discuss and decide on a constitution, when we all know full well that by the end of this decade the European Union will have 27 members.
But if this future is shared, then obviously they are together.
The arguments against and the warnings about a multi-speed Europe, are still ringing in my ears.
Firstly, with regard to the method, which is a tired, lifeless procedure according to public opinion, which in fact marginalises the other institutions of the European Union and in which governments are victims of their own labyrinth.
Mr President, we have heard that progress was made at Biarritz on closer cooperation.
The danger, however, is that reinforced cooperation will break up the unity of Europe through the back door, resulting in a patchwork of intergovernmental cooperation.
I concede, however, that the political situation has not been conducive to going that far and I therefore give my unreserved support to the Duhamel report currently before us.
Mr President, as the last speaker, I too should like to congratulate Mr Duhamel on his excellent work and Mr Gil-Robles on his work.
We therefore want the matter re-referred to ourselves.
I will not take this into consideration.
What is the meaning of the expression "the deadline within which Member States are required to guarantee unemployed individuals a chance to access an active employment measure should not exceed two years" , if not a threat to unemployment benefits?
Mr President, I voted for the Souchet report which is intended to further facilitate the process of turning agricultural products into packaged agricultural products.
This is because it confirms the possibility of turning traditional vines into GMO vines and therefore the possibility that, in the future, we will be drinking genetically modified wine.
It is proposed to allow material for the vegetative propagation of the vine which meets reduced specifications to be marketed when temporary difficulties arise without, however, specifying what these difficulties might be.
The reason is that Mr Smith' s pension contributions are low whereas the amount paid by Mr Rossi is very high.
In principle, the decentralised application of Community law can only be a success if there are strong commitments given that this will be uniformly applied across all the territories of the European Union.
State aids have been traditionally used by Member States as instruments of industrial and social policy.
I am less pleased with the idea expressed in paragraph 2 that state aid should not go up.
We find the constant pressures and concomitant institutional measures, such as the proposed state aid register and scoreboard, unacceptable.
Section V, Court of Auditors;
Even the Commission' s estimate of payments for the preliminary draft budget has been very cautious, too cautious as far as we are concerned.
Countermeasures must be taken against this at every political level; i.e. at local, regional, national, and I hardly need mention, at European level.
Following the happy outcome of the elections in Serbia, we are, however, now obliged to support Serbia with financial aid and not just with fine words and grand proclamations.
Thirdly, at the end of the day, the taxpayers must get added value for their money.
In fact we are directly linked to the interest rate set by the European Central Bank, which is why we have proposed that we should pursue the buildings policy already adopted, because this will help to release us from this burden of interest as soon as possible.
The Economic and Social Committee is still a real problem child.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ECSC Treaty will expire in June 2002.
This seems odd to us because there will still be an operational budget in the second part of 2002, and so we are calling for a review of the relationship between redeployment aid and social aid.
The proposal I am asking you to support by voting in favour of the report is the result of a long process and fulfils an aspiration that has been held by Parliament almost since its inception.
We believe that this declaration should be included in the Interinstitutional Agreement, but in any case, I would like to say to you that it only makes sense within the context of an Interinstitutional Agreement with a financial perspective.
I hope that the budget discussions can continue in the same vein so that we can come up with a budget for the financial year 2001 that equips us with the resources to meet the priorities and challenges that await the European Union.
Concerning the cutback of EUR 225 million in the field of rural development, the Council' s position is a response to the cumulative lags in national rural development plans.
This to me is also taking an extreme view.
We must practise what we preach to the Member States, and it is bringing all these strands together that makes budgetary policy so exciting, as all those who are involved would testify.
One of the conditions imposed was that the comitology procedure must be changed.
The question as to whether the necessary measures can be carved from the previous package for the Mediterranean programme, is a political and not a technical issue.
We shall support his and Chris Patten' s attempt to strengthen the Commission' s effectiveness by means of parliamentary scrutiny and the necessary parliamentary control to which the Council and Mr Solana are not of course subject.
The first of these is for the implementation of a pilot project intended to fund an information campaign within the fifteen Member States against the criminal scourge of paedophilia.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has requested expert reports on this, with a view to receiving appropriate advice from the European Central Bank on the financial aspect.
The proposals put forward by our committee and supported by the Committee on Budgets are much better.
Anyone who maintains that part of its job would be to block mergers or halt globalisation, does so for purely polemical reasons.
It is the duty of the House to give those points their support in the vote this week, to demonstrate its continued commitment to protecting the environment and improving public health.
The Committee on Fisheries, which shares with the Commission the principle of budgetary stringency, has accepted the limits set by the latter in its preliminary draft and has indicated its concerns in certain budget headings.
All parties must assume their responsibilities and fulfil their obligations.
The European Commission struggled to come to terms with the extension of priorities, and this has led to unacceptable gaps in the implementation of commitments which were made under pressure of ever larger budgets for support to foreign aid and cooperation operations.
We must also bear in mind that all this is related to the fight against domestic violence, which is taking place under the DAPHNE programme.
There are no better guardians of the Treaties than the European citizens.
The context of our debate today is that we must use whatever opportunity we have in our budget to make sure that our European institutions are ready for the next stage of enlargement, both in terms of the institutions' structures as well as improved policy management.
Before coming to that, a word on the position of the British Conservatives.
We understand that there is a need for more personnel, but what is of most concern to us is that we do not grant this request until the reform process of the institutions is well under way.
However, of course this also means coming clean with the tax payer and those who listen to us, on a whole range of points, so as to give them a realistic picture of the conditions we work under.
But we have made promises in the past, or rather made announcements and formulated common policies that will in fact need to be converted into payments at some stage.
Let there be no mistake, I think it is criminal to give people who have been affected by natural disasters the impression that we have the means to solve all the problems they face as a result.
Even though we endorse many of the points of criticism directed at the Council, it is clear that a strategy of this kind would lead to a politically untenable confrontation and undermine the credibility of the European institutions.
We fear that the majority of the committee members have used the wrong tactics.
Mrs Haug, the general rapporteur also attempted, last night, to amend her report in this respect in order to reflect the concerns expressed by my Group, and I must thank her for that.
It is possible to make substantial savings, either by saving the monies arising from the under implementation of certain programmes, or by the European Union' s at last taking a decision to stop using budget lines for the purposes of pro-Europe propaganda.
We must give the Commission the opportunity to eliminate the backlog by increasing its staffing levels.
The tax burden must therefore be reduced in percentage terms, and only an economic upturn and accompanying economic growth will secure increased state revenue.
The needs are self-evident, we have many commitments, the importance of external cooperation in asserting the European Union' s presence on the world stage is obvious, and there is a very low implementation rate for various programmes.
We are trying to safeguard Parliament' s priorities in category 4.
We reckon we have more scientific evidence than your guess at a figure.
(Laughter and applause)
The 'small countries' , for example, to use a quite inappropriate term, should not feel themselves excluded from reinforced cooperation or that reinforced cooperation means some sort of exclusive vanguard, centre of gravity or pioneer group.
I therefore think it was quite appropriate, in this context, to ask an external authority, that was not morally implicated, to undertake this task.
It is up to the Colombian authorities to define the practical means by which the Colombian Government might undertake to dismantle the paramilitary groups.
Many of us believe that the problems in Colombia, as in other Latin American countries, stem from the issue of whether or not peasant-farmers own land.
I think I have already answered this question.
I should not like you to think that the Council does not answer the questions asked of it.
With reference to any discussions it may have held with the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs of the EU Member States and of third countries, will the Council Presidency say who is opposed to this measure and what the main political and technical obstacles are to the introduction of a tax of this kind?
The creation of a Tobin tax is an attractive option, one championed by many Members on both the left and right wing, by a variety of political and non-political organisations, non-governmental organisations, university groups.
Mr President, I do not refute your own personal convictions.
I am sorry.
Therefore, they sometimes cannot distinguish the President-in-Office of the Council from a militant.
The basic question I would like an answer to, and I am speaking as an all-round figure which includes my militant persona, is what are the conditions necessary for it to work.
The Council is actively involved in examining the Commission proposal and these amendments with a view to managing in the near future to issue a position on this.
Mrs Isler Béguin will pardon me if I do not wish to go into great detail in response to a debate on BSE which has a justifiable place in this House after entering into a debate on the Tobin tax.
Thank you for your answer, Mr President, but the question went rather further.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur.
Then it was not known that the Council and the Commission would be promising aid for the reconstruction of Serbia and Kosovo, to come out of this money.
There are poor people in Europe too, even if only retired farm workers.
External needs reveal the shortages in category 4.
We are now at first reading and you have enough time to seek full agreement with Parliament.
We can only be transparent and accountable if all the decision-makers are clear about the budget and what lies behind the budget.
As elected representatives, we are of course delighted with any move to make the Budget more easily understandable.
There is, however, a popular demand that we solve the problem of how best to provide aid to Serbia.
I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate and to dwell on the importance of the agricultural budget and its relevance not just to farmers but to society in general.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would, of course, like to thank all rapporteurs.
Mr President, the Council really has surpassed itself in its proposed draft budget 2001.
Political stability depends upon the improvement of living conditions.
Having said this, and also taking into account that the Commission itself has admitted that for 2001 applications from Member States for payments for the Structural Funds exceed the predictions of the PDB by EUR 8 000 million, I think that it is now time for the Council to start considering very seriously that we should do something about payments and not increase the backlog of payments.
Until this point has been clarified and discussed in detail, I flatly refuse to speak about any revision of the Financial Perspective.
The finance ministers did, of course, receive significantly larger sums of money back from last year' s Budget.
For Sweden, this would involve approximately EUR 65 million.
Our group relates the strategy for the general budget to the quality of spending and efficient management, and this also extends to the ECSC budget.
But my main point is about the ACP.
Instead, these subsidies must be removed step by step, though on condition that the farmers concerned are given structural aid for the purpose of switching production to other goods.
I say without apology that I am going to address the effects that the European Union has had in my region.
The European model considers the protection of personal data to be a fundamental right guaranteed by legally binding rules, based on the principle of peoples' self-determination of data, that is the principle whereby everyone must be able to decide whether and how personal data concerning him can be collected and used.
I am confident that our untiring work will win the full approval of the European Parliament and the Council.
I really do hope it is ensured that the regulations will not be applied in that way.
In my opinion, it is clear that we would be closing our eyes to the problem if we set up an authority of this type to cover just the Community area, while the main problems arise and will, in future, arise due to third pillar bodies too.
In my opinion, the rapporteur has done everything feasible to extend the possibility, at least of cooperating and probably of exerting influence on this matter, and so we fully support her report.
More specifically, the Commission' s position on the amendments contained in the Paciotti report is as follows.
The European Data Protection Supervisor will in fact play a leading role in Community institutions' respecting the provisions protecting citizens' personal data.
The Azores, the Canaries, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Madeira, Martinique and Réunion form a separate category whose uniqueness has now been recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam on the basis of an innovative concept: they are defined as 'outermost regions' .
The success of the new Community policy to assist the outermost regions calls for action geared to the strategic areas of the world economy: transport, energy, the environment, the information society, research and technological development.
We hope that the Commission will carry out this timetable or programme and, above all, we hope that the great institution that the Commission currently has, the interdepartmental group, will remain in contact with the outermost regions, informing the central authorities of our needs and our specific problems.
In fact, what we say here today and how we vote tomorrow will be front-page news in the seven outermost regions, and the news reports on the regional television channels will report extensively on what we say and decide here.
This is why we have so many problems generating wealth and creating employment.
I am therefore pleased that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted a bold and ambitious stance on state aid, tax schemes and the implications of enlargement.
Owing to permanent unfavourable factors the special status accorded remote regions and the special assistance they should receive are justified, although differences should not be evened out by means of permanently defined versions of Internal Market rules and permanent entitlement to structural funding.
Mr President, Parliament, and in particular its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has been the driving force for approving specific policies and programmes for the outermost regions.
For this they need specific treatment, which is expressed through a will for durability in the series of measures.
Consequently, on the occasion of the preparations for the previous Intergovernmental Conference, they backed the negotiations which - I remember this clearly as I was the French negotiator for the Treaty of Amsterdam at the time - led to Article 299(2) being adopted.
Indeed, when the time comes, it will be necessary, moreover, to offer the Council the same support and the same message.
Earlier, Mr Pohjamo, you yourself mentioned this anxiety, echoing the work and the commitment of Mr Sanchez, and let me at this point ask you to convey our wishes for a speedy recovery to him, given his current health problems.
A partnership day was held on 23 November 1999, in which many of us participated.
I do not want to reopen that issue.
Mr President, Mr Evans has just referred to yesterday morning' s vote, specifically to the vote at which certain amendments were adopted by a majority of one.
We are what we eat - and sadly that is true in my case.
Such was the case with the company that manufactured polio vaccines in the United Kingdom using bovine foetal serum, prohibited since 1999, and with the distribution via a French agri-foodstuffs distribution chain of one thousand kilos of meat from herds contaminated with BSE.
Decision-making must be clear and transparent.
Mr President, let me begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, and let me also inform the Commissioner, David Byrne, that we appreciate the proposals he has put before us in this White Paper and the relations he has established with Parliament with a view to preparing the best possible legislation in the field of food safety for the future.
It will not be a day when we look with any particular pride at the procedures we then had.
These things are inextricably linked with what the food authority will be doing.
The report is right to draw a distinction between risk analysis on the one hand and risk management on the other.
However, Mr President, I should like to highlight two points here.
Finally, who better than the Member States to inform the public of the risks linked to this or that product?
Not only does the WHO cover Europe it also has a wider remit across the whole planet and this is important.
This makes sense if the European Food Safety Agency is also to be able to operate independently of the Commission and if, whenever necessary, it is to take prompt crisis management action.
I have tabled an amendment on this subject, and I hope you will support it.
And the ones who need to do something about this are not so much the Commission and ourselves, but rather the Member States, who so far have not done their homework.
My group supports most of the amendments.
A reliable legislative framework, the definition of acceptable risk and the practical safeguarding of local food and production diversities are aspects which still require attention, together with those of small and medium-sized businesses and the training of their employees.
Could a European Food Safety Agency have prevented a dioxin crisis and a BSE crisis?
There is an indissoluble relationship between eating healthily and eating well, a relationship of which consumers must be made more aware in order to promote quality and support the typical local products which are one of the great assets of the peoples of Europe.
Therefore, as Mihail Papayannakis said, we too are going to approve and support the report.
Moreover, no food products which are genetically modified or contain genetically modified ingredients should be allowed into the food chain until they are fully tested, and only then with clear labelling specifications.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on food safety has laid a firm basis for better food in future and I am also hopeful of more environmentally-friendly and people-friendly production of food.
For us to be able to restore consumer confidence in the safety of food and maintain it, the Food Safety Agency must start its work with adequate public resources.
Mr President, I congratulate John Bowis on his excellent work.
I myself do not think this way and trust in the strength and basic principles of European integration throughout the EU.
In addition, part of the body' s efficiency will consist of transparent decision-making and the swift publication on the Internet of its studies and recommendations, as happens with, for example, the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin, which is running extremely smoothly.
I welcome the fact that there is broad agreement on the main principles: that a new scientific body responsible for food safety risk assessment should be established, that it should be independent, accountable, transparent and subject to the needs of objective research and of commercial confidentiality and that it should provide the public with accessible and comprehensible information.
Other people's experience and findings can be pooled with our own, and findings can be assessed at pan-European level.
We have scientific committees advising the Commission.
There have even been widely conflicting views about the main point of the White Paper, the creation of a Food Safety Agency.
The priority of absolute concern for humans is based on these principles.
Upon careful examination of the White Paper in the Member States and here in Parliament, it will then be given legislative status in the form of a new draft directive.
Several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament: for example, the package of proposals recasting and updating the hygiene legislation.
I am encouraged to note the high degree of agreement between Parliament's views as expressed in the draft report that you have debated, and the White Paper itself.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that Parliament has tackled the issue of anti-personnel landmines.
The final point concerns the amendments.
In this respect we can only regret the fact that one Member State, Finland, has not yet signed and another, Greece, has not yet proceeded to ratification, as Mrs Morgantini has just pointed out.
The challenge is enormous, but the extent of this tragedy demands that we make an enormous effort and commitment to put an end to this situation.
After all, the European Parliament took the lead in the Union in the fight against landmines.
The European Union has a clear position, set out in the 1997 joint action on extending signature and ratification of the Ottawa Convention to as many countries as possible.
We have adopted a flexible, coordinating approach rather than a rigid, centralising one.
Similarly, we do not want to create another committee, be it management or advisory.
Governments have expressed their commitment and pledged large sums of money.
The Commissioner for external relations has previously recognised that the Commission's external aid programmes have been an embarrassment.
Commissioner, you said that you were against a number of amendments.
Mrs Bonino and Mr Patten are right in saying that it makes obvious sense to destroy the stockpiles, because the cost of destroying a stockpiled mine is only a hundredth of that of destroying one which has been transported to a place where it is difficult to find.
All the institutions of the EU must work on their own initiative and in a way that the poor countries that suffer worst from the mines problem are effectively included in the programme.
Eliminating them is no longer a military problem but a humanitarian issue.
At this point I wish to specifically stress that we need to call upon further States to sign or promptly ratify the Ottawa Convention, so as to assist international coordination and rehabilitation of mine victims.
I therefore ask that the importance of increasing this amount be conveyed to the Council, which is not represented here, and to the Commission, given that unfortunately, for each mine that is cleared, between 20 and 50 others are laid.
However, nor should we ignore the fact that the European Union, and in particular the European Parliament, is increasingly in a position to check more effectively where the money we intend for this purpose is actually going.
Many victims are small children, who suffer terrible trauma and appalling mutilation, and whose lives are destroyed before they have even started properly.
For my part, I want to highlight the need to adopt the convention universally so that it may become a total success, firstly by ensuring the compliance of the laws of the various states, so as not to have yet another example of an international agreement that fails to be applied.
The criticisms, however, are sanctimonious and based on ignorance.
This effort must also be made more effective through coordination and monitoring of the processes, giving NGOs a more extensive role to play.
The reports give less emphasis to the fact that the majority of those mines were manufactured outside the countries in which they are buried.
I shall be quite appalled if the Commission really intends to support these totally unrealistic, almost absurd demands, which have just been approved.
The Commission will use its right of initiative and support the Member States in bringing necessary changes about.
Many of the demands made in the Van Lancker report are not acceptable.
Over and above the legal quibbling on all sides, the Biarritz Summit has confirmed that the process of European enlargement is a matter of laborious haggling.
We in the Austrian Freedom Party have from the outset declared ourselves in favour of a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The EPLP has consistently not supported incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as rights are covered by national legislation and the European Convention on Human Rights.
In our view, however, the interpretations of 15 judges, which go beyond the Treaties as ratified, are clearly improper and we are still waiting for them to be submitted for the approval of the peoples of the Member States.
We should not accept this, whoever uses such language, whether it comes from the extreme right or the extreme left.
The Portuguese socialist MEPs voted for the Duhamel report on the constitutionalisation of the Treaties essentially because they agree with the need for the European Union to simplify and organise the fundamental texts that govern it, which today have become virtually unreadable on account of the complexity introduced by the successive accumulation of Treaties.
While desirable in itself, a constitution of this kind could only be adopted as the crowning touch to far-reaching institutional reform.
As Jacques Delors rightly pointed out at a meeting of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs scarcely a month ago, the term 'constitution' is extremely ambiguous.
I would even have voted against it, but this would have been an over-radical way of judging a text as important as this.
The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome this report without endorsing all of its detail.
Everyone here knows that Europe, its currency, its diplomacy, its security, its civilisation, its culture and its social model can only truly survive the splendid history of its peoples, but also the fruitless dissension between them, by becoming a federation of nation states with strong, coherent and respected institutions, enshrined in a European Constitution, towards which Mr Duhamel has paved the way.
Removing the conditions which state that closer cooperation must remain within the framework of the Treaty and removing the right of veto and the opportunity for bringing the issue up in the European Council would constitute a breach of the quite fundamental principles according to which European cooperation in the EU operates.
In fact, although this report tends to introduce a little more flexibility into the highly inflexible system laid down by Title VII of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is welcome, the final result is still far from adequate.
In fact, Europe is finding it more and more difficult to move forward at the same pace.
That is why the large allocation of EU Structural Funds was made.
If reinforced cooperation proves necessary I am convinced that only the Community system offers the necessary guarantees in terms of democratic control, legal controls and solidarity.
We also regret the lack of any reference to, or even mention of, the need to protect biodiversity, which is one of the most important assets of the outermost regions.
The Europe of Brussels, with its mania for levelling out and standardising, has acted unfairly and even stupidly towards our compatriots who live according to European values thousands of kilometres away from Paris, Madrid or Lisbon.
Similarly, the Netherlands and Denmark each have two regions in, or on the other side of, the Atlantic, but those areas are expressly not included in the European Union.
The most important points include the creation of the European Food Safety Agency, which we welcome and of which we expect a great deal.
It was essential for us to give an opinion on an issue that is so important to our fellow citizens.
That is not at all the direction taken by the White Paper, which wants to make the European agency into a "scientific point of reference for the whole Union" (page 5).
But we need to go further than this.
For my part, in France, I do not need an authority in order to restore my confidence; I trust the French Food Safety Agency and its opinions, especially in relation to mad cow disease.
Whilst I respect people's democratic right to table amendments, can I just warn Members of this House that if some of the amendments which are not in the general framework agreement between the groups are voted, then we will begin to exceed ceilings and we will have to stop the vote.
The same applies to line B3-306 for the PRINCE information campaign.
The vote concerns an amendment tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to increase the tobacco subsidy by EUR 5 million.
Madam President, in that case the amendment will unfortunately have to be put to the vote in the form proposed by the Committee on Budgets.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0270/2000) by Mr Moreira Da Silva, on behalf of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication on EU policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: Towards a European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) [COM(2000) 0088 - C5-0192/2000 - 2000/2103(COS)]
Instead of controlling the erratic movements of capital, the priority is 'structural reforms' actually aimed at privatising and deregulating anything still left to be privatised and deregulated.
We believe that funds for the Balkans can instead be taken from the programmes in category 4 that are sadly not fully utilised at present.
Haug Report (A5-0300/2000)
We would also like to welcome the fact that Parliament has shown itself open to an initiative which, in our opinion, warrants the attention of this House.
It is interesting to note that the EU parties are clearly incapable of inducing either their member parties or the individual members of the member parties to pay a fee for membership of the EU party. Instead, we are forced to finance the EU parties with public funds.
What 'unbundled access to the local loop' actually does is force public operators to put the leasing of public telephone lines out to commercial tender as soon as possible.
But, precisely because we are dealing with the local loop, customers' interests need to be taken into particular account.
The quotas and the thresholds are like Scylla and Charybdis and to change them is to jump out of the frying pan into the fire.
Since it appears from Appendix III that glasshouse horticulture does not benefit from the proposed subsidy scheme for vegetables and fruit, I am putting my objections on hold for the time being.
It is for this reason that despite having approved this document, I wanted to emphasise in the explanations of vote that next time it would be a good idea to survey and take into consideration the situation in which pensioners in Hong Kong find themselves compared with pensioners in the Peoples' Republic of China, in order to see whether this reunification has been advantageous or detrimental to them.
It is only three years since the Kyoto Conference and the European Environmental Agency estimates that, if emissions in the EU continue at present rates, instead of an 8% reduction in emissions of CO2 between 1990-2010, there will be a 6% increase, while in the USA the outlook is even worse.
The rapporteur is right to point out that the European Commission' s original proposal is inadequate.
That is why our resolution is important, and I have voted for it.
As everyone knows, life is full of risks and uncertainties.
We also need to define a more specific framework for research, standardising tests and cooperation between various scientific teams so that reliable results can be achieved.
We need to go further.
They need the help of the Member States.
As a consequence, these companies could have their base anywhere in the European Union, even though they are not banks.
That is what they are doing to this day, as we can see from the many complaints made by small and medium-sized businesses and the complaints made by the public about the high charges for transferring small amounts, which are quite simply very much in evidence.
Samples are actually sufficient.
The acceptance of the euro also depends greatly on whether consumers and companies are able to use the euro area as an internal payment zone.
Maybe, in fact most probably, the time has come for an Internet bank to be set up which does not charge any costs.
Madam President, there is a second reason for the European Parliament' s perseverance.
This morning the euro sank to an all-time low.
Today the average fee for transferring EUR 100 to another country in the internal market is EUR 17.10, many times more than the fees for domestic transfers.
In fact, in time, there should not be a discrepancy at all between cross-border and domestic payments.
That report - and I am turning to Mrs Peijs in particular - will contain legislative proposals amending the 1997 Directive which entered into effect last year.
Parliament, in its wisdom, completely shares your view.
The SME is not a multinational in miniature, any more than it suffices to extrapolate the difficulties of a small business quantitatively to get a proper grasp of the problems of large units.
Until recently, after completing their studies and training, many young people made a choice between going into the civil service or simply into larger companies which are similar to the state.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after eleven years in this House, I can bear witness to the fact that debates on small and medium-sized businesses in our Parliament are neither new nor rare.
Today, I would particularly like to make a case for systematically eliminating as many as possible, if not all, barriers which stand in the way of establishing the internal market, and for optimising the competitiveness of SMEs, allowing them to develop in a dynamic and sustained manner.
Our greatest potential for adaptation resides in them.
In parallel, we propose to introduce a European innovation area, and I am grateful to Mrs Montfort for having agreed to include that proposal in her report.
We endorse the attention which the rapporteur, Mrs Montfort, is paying - rightly so - to small and medium-sized businesses, and micro-enterprises, as well as to granting priority support to young fledgling entrepreneurs.
My contact there is Magister Leitner, and if I come across a problem related to support programmes or a problem with the European institutions, then I can tell my employers that there is someone there who is competent and in the know, someone who can give information in the shortest possible time about public calls for tender, support programmes or research on infrastructure.
That is why we should make it our business to bring down tax rates as far as possible by introducing less hefty laws, slimmed-down benchmarking and best practices so as to create a simple and well-ordered environment for our businesses.
I am reminded of what the Commissioner said to us a year ago about the experience in the United States, where they are not afraid of failure and they believe in the old Scottish proverb of "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again".
In many of the 15 Member States, persons working on their own account have lower pensions, lower levels of mutual assistance and less industrial injury insurance.
That is why we should 'think small first' .
We also need to give careful thought to the level of European governance best adapted to the various initiatives.
Mr President, the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere stress the need to cooperate with countries of origin and transit of migrants and refugees and, within this framework on the Council's instructions, the High-Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration has drawn up six action plans, one of which is the plan for Albania and the neighbouring region.
So bearing all these problems in mind, the proposals set out in my report include: gradual application of the measures proposed in the action plan, a study of the real needs, such as that contained in the first part, which indicates where the most urgent problems lie; for example, first the economy and democratic institutions need to be developed and infrastructures need to be created in Albania and then the Union can think about signing refugee and migrant repatriation agreements.
Mr President, the action plan states in its analysis that the status quo in Albania is worrying.
(Applause)
The tighter the borders we attempt to create, the more insane forms of refugee smuggling we shall see.
The people are, of course, hopeful of better political representation but at present, many people still live in fear; fear of all kinds of things, fear of the outbursts of violence which flare up now and again.
There are jobs in Greece, for example, which, if the Albanian immigrants leave, will remain undone, mainly in the agricultural sector.
At present, there is a heavy stream of refugees returning which the lack of security, law and order is actually impeding.
The action programme for Albania and its neighbouring regions will enable us to increase stability in the area.
All this and the unacceptable events in Himara give us cause, I think, to make a very careful assessment of just how able and willing Albania is to take on the accepted European criteria in the areas of human rights and democratic freedoms and, by extension, to modulate and adjust our general approach, our action plans and the various benefits which we provide this country accordingly until such time it revises its policy.
I should like to make a second point.
The General Affairs Council adopted the first five action plans last October, and they concern Somalia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Morocco, and Iraq.
Indeed, we had a very earnest and also very self-critical debate about the quality of European lawmaking and the application of the principle of subsidiarity.
We ask the Commission here quite specifically to observe the clear demarcation of responsibilities both between the EU and the Member States and within the institutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first and foremost like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling for the work he has invested in his report.
We can accept this point and this report reflects that spirit, in demanding clarity of law, simplicity of law and proportionality of the legal means to the public end sought.
We would actually like the Commission to give us more details on the proper application of this principle for each proposal, so that a real balance sheet can be drawn up at the time of the annual report.
Mr MacCormick stated - it is, in fact, true - that I had said that the principle of subsidiarity was not a legal principle but rather a political principle.
If it is a guarantor and not a master, it immediately follows that in the structure created by Mr Wuermeling, under which powers would be devolved to the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, what should subsequently be guaranteed is that an identical process must also be followed by these same Member States.
Several accomplished speakers from the European People' s Party have already taken the floor to express the views of the group.
That was not a procedural motion but I think you are entitled, as rapporteur, to make that point clear.
This directive could be 64 pages long, extremely detailed, mathematical, and involve a lot of engineering expertise.
Better Lawmaking - A Shared Responsibility (1998) [COM(1998) 715 - C5-0266/2000 - 1999/2197(COS)]
The old exchange rate difference between buying and selling has been replaced by a fixed levy per money withdrawal.
The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0546/00) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the state of negotiations for a new fisheries agreement with Morocco.
On the other hand, having said this, we also maintain that not just any agreement will suffice.
From our standpoint, it is of vital importance that Community fishermen resume their activities at a level compatible with the obligation to guarantee sustainable resources.
As a Member of the European Parliament from the German coast I can comprehend what the fishermen and their families, who have literally been high and dry for months, are going through.
We all knew from the start that it was a difficult negotiation.
The agreements with third countries have very great significance for the European Union and especially for those regions with large fishing harbours.
Fundamental changes are needed so that there is a reduction in global fishing and so that a smaller proportion of the fisheries budget is used for agreements with third countries.
And on the European side, we have the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which is being put to the test.
This House has been quite rightly criticised along with the Commission regarding the agreement with Morocco, which from the outset has been addressed with tremendous hesitation and naivety.
Mr President, the absence of Mr Fischler, which is justified, as the chair of the Committee on Fisheries made clear earlier, prevents me from going into too much detail.
This means the end of shore-based activities, boat repairs, the provisioning of vessels, canning factories and oil factories, which is to say that a whole economic sector is currently paralysed as a result of this.
Under this agreement, around 500 boats from the European Union, 50 of which are Portuguese, have had access to Moroccan waters at an annual cost of around EUR 125 million.
The little information that is available is unclear, despite the fact that negotiations have continued - or so we are told - with various complicated ups and downs.
We must protect the world' s fish stocks.
In doing so, however, we must not lose sight of the fact that relations between the European Union and the transit countries around our borders, and I am thinking in particular here of North Africa, Turkey and Russia, which act as bridges on the borders of the European Union to other parts of the world and to other countries - that these countries deserve our particular support.
He had gained a favourable impression from his meeting, which augurs well for the negotiations, due to start on 30 October, being conducted in a constructive spirit.
Nonetheless, thank you for your most interesting contribution.
The text would then read: "Whereas the persons affected, who are Union citizens, have been involved in protracted and repetitive litigation and have seen their legitimate expectations dashed.
We exchanged a great deal of correspondence with the players concerned and went to a great deal of trouble to select from among piles of irrelevant documents the elements that proved conclusively that the former lettori had in fact been the victims of discrimination by certain Italian universities in respect of their financial acquired rights such as salaries and contributions to pension schemes.
Under Italian law, you do not become a university lecturer automatically by virtue of experience, you have to pass a public examination.
If the Commission were truly serious about resolving this issue it would have been resolved years ago.
We are a small House because it is a Friday morning but it needs to be noticed and recognised that this is an all-party issue and an all-Union issue.
In a Kafkaesque style the universities even went as far as to remove their names from the internal telephone books, the doors and the university websites.
I think that the saying "If you don't take yourself seriously, no-one else will" is most apt here.
There are thus two things, which I would not describe as being different, but which are linked together slightly differently over time.
The root of the issue is that it is impossible to grant a language assistant, a person who is well versed in English and comes to an Italian medical university to explain to the students what the Italian terms are for heart disease, operation, liver disease, and so forth, to have the same rights, on the basis of their having the same status, as someone who teaches medicine.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned and wish you a pleasant weekend.
We are united in shock and grief for the 150 people who died and we share in the pain of their relatives.
With regard to the report by Mr Ceyhun, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I have received two requests: one request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists for referral of this report to committee, and one request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for deferral of this report to a later part-session.
(Parliament gave its assent) Relating to Tuesday:
Madam President, my group has listened carefully to this proposal.
b) Sittings of 29 and 30 November 2000:
I had indicated that I wanted to speak before you closed the discussion on the agenda.
This is an extremely serious initiative towards reintroducing censorship in Italy, limited to text books for the moment but which will soon be extended to other areas.
We also support the result of the binding nature of the framework decision, which forces Member States to harmonise their laws for the common good whilst being subject to judicial supervision by the Court of Justice.
Moreover, Parliament should be represented on the management board of Europol and should have a say in the choice of the director of the agency.
In the more specific area of combating money laundering, we could cite the Council Directive of 10 June 1991, as recently amended, for which our fellow MEP, Mr Lehne, acted as rapporteur.
I can only say that, as a result, the Council did admittedly make a big show of cooperating, but the bulk of the amendments tabled by us and adopted here in this House by a very large majority were not accepted.
In dealing with these matters, our rapporteurs have centred their considerations both on the Protocol amending the Europol Convention and on improving mutual assistance.
And, of course, we must do so on the basis of a common definition of what crime is and of what methods it uses, so that it cannot flee from one country to another, at least not for purely procedural reasons.
I want to speak about the Karamanou report on Europol.
We have far too many police forces already and we are going to have even more once we have completed enlargement, our ability to deal with organised crime is going to be very much less than it should be.
We must ensure that those who are the innocent victims - the collateral damage I suppose we should call it - of the war upon crime are not left languishing in jails, incommunicado from their families.
Well, here we have another good example: in combating money laundering we may put at stake something that, far from being a lawyer' s privilege, is an essential element in this right to a fair trial, which in turn is an essential element in all our European development, culture and identity.
We are the only ones here who want to see measures that truly prevent money laundering, which is to say the immediate abolition of banking secrecy, the trade secret, the business secret, access to the accounting ledgers of all banking and manufacturing companies and the right of all the employees of these companies, of all consumers, to bring to the public' s attention any transfer of funds that is against the interests of society at large.
According to the United Nations, the annual volume of money recycled through money-laundering operations is approaching USD 1 billion.
With regard to a compromise situation on this issue, there are two options: either the article in question refers to people who concentrate on certain activities and does not need to mention lawyers or any other professional category, or it refers to lawyers, creating a situation which in itself threatens professional confidentiality, however much the article specifies or defines the activities to which it refers.
As I understand it, 'immediately' makes the requirement more pressing than setting a deadline of two months for a refusal to cooperate.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, part of the price of freedom is that the democratic state under the rule of law frequently chases wrongdoers from quite some distance when it wishes to prosecute them.
The committee responsible has gone along with me on this and I am pleased to say that the signals coming from the Council are also positive.
This is the aim of our amendments.
We could not get any action from Europol or from Interpol operators in that country and there was a lack of understanding of the necessity for somebody to be brought to trial as quickly as possible.
Systems of criminal law are, of course, among the clearest cultural expressions of a society.
What Parliament has to adopt a position on today is vigorous judicial cooperation for the purpose of combating serious organised crime.
Mr President, I would very quickly like to begin by thanking Mrs Gebhardt for her excellent report and by saying that the Commission endorses almost all of the points that have fuelled her reflections.
But as concerns Eurojust, this is a network for coordinating the actions of national judges and public prosecutors with the objective of enhancing capabilities for combating types of serious crime at European level.
While, with this annual report, the new Commission will quite clearly be held accountable and will need to be reminded of its duty, the FAIR Programme is, as it were, unfinished business from a bygone era.
My question to the Commission in this regard highlighted some possibilities, but unfortunately no usable result has yet emerged.
Mr President, I welcome this report by Mrs Langenhagen, the contents of which I am very happy to endorse.
In that connection, I should like to make it clear that, in view of the very great degree of expertise possessed by the Commission, we cannot accept that so many of the things we adopted in the decisions have not been implemented.
I would particularly like to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her very constructive report, along with the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and of the Committee on Fisheries and notably the rapporteur, Mr Busk.
However, as soon as I took up office, I also took an initiative to set up an informal working party which looked into the issue of simplifying and improving procedures, and I have already had an opportunity to talk about this before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
It is perfectly clear that these dialogues are necessary and there is clearly a joint responsibility here; it is also up to the Court to enter into these dialogues, but I can, in any case, assure you that both the Court and the Commission' s services, along with Parliament, share the same commitment to progress in terms of resolving these problems.
The Commission shares this commitment, and I would like to hope that we can work in the best possible atmosphere to carry through this research programme, which is essential at European level, but which must be implemented in conformity with the most stringent of rules on efficiency and on financial control.
Mr Bethell, your point has nothing to do with the approval of the Minutes but I can, however, readily inform you that the Conference of Presidents voted to give this year' s Sakharov Prize to the 'Basta Ya' association.
This Charter is also the expression of a common set of basic values for all the candidate countries, for all the countries wishing to join the European Union, and it is precisely in the area of social rights that it sends candidate countries a clear message that they must comply with these social standards.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to join the European Parliament in expressing the Presidency' s sympathies on the occasion of the accident which occurred near Salzburg in Austria, and say that we fully share in the sorrow of the families of the victims of this most serious accident.
Members of the European Parliament, particularly in our previous debate, have already expressed the wish to repeat the experiment.
Overall, I should say that this text unquestionably marks the greatest collective advance in terms of affirming social rights, both because of the importance of the rights enshrined and also because these rights are included for the first time in the same text as civic and political rights, thereby officially signposting the indivisible nature of all fundamental rights.
I should, moreover, also like to point out some grounds for satisfaction for the Presidency, and I believe for other institutions too, in the overall position adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation, which stresses the connection between the Charter and the social agenda and which concludes that the Convention' s proposed Charter, adopted by the Heads of State and Government, "represents an important step towards the construction of a social and a citizens' Europe" .
That is why it was so important and why Parliament was right not only to invest so much hope in a new Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union but also to help so intensively and constructively to bring it about.
It clearly sets out our citizens' rights for them and clearly sets out the legal positions which the institutions, bodies and agencies of the European Union must comply with and respect when acting on behalf of the people of Europe.
Our governments need to obtain tangible results in Nice that they can offer to our citizens - institutional matters are important but, as the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner are well aware, they are difficult to sell to public opinion.
Some think it a success and others now think it a thwarted ambition.
The Charter cannot serve as a smokescreen for the French Presidency in order to conceal an IGC that is on its last legs.
Well then, let us endeavour to ensure that this situation is not repeated in the case of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We are currently conspiring to kill off the Commission, a murder with a willing victim, since the Commission fell in with the Council' s proposals last week.
Madam President, first my heartfelt thanks to my friend and delegation leader Méndez de Vigo, who swapped places with me because I was due to head a conciliation for parliament.
How can we fail to recognise that in the twenty-first century, once the concept of dignity has been set forth, the key thing is the indivisibility of the whole package of rights?
Mrs President, the Charter includes a number of welcome points.
It is a sad thing that the party of Churchill and Maxwell Fyfe should have come to this point that, when we at last try to ensure that the institutions of the Union are not the tyrants of Brussels but persons subject under Article 51 to the obligations binding on all institutions of the Union, the British Conservatives say "no".
We should not be drawing up lists of advantages and disadvantages, Madam President.
The second fascinating aspect is that we are today discussing human rights and citizens' rights, a subject over which the European Union has no form of jurisdiction.
I could not agree with him more.
It is true, as one of the speakers said, that we have to make an effort to inform people about the Charter, an effort that can begin in this Parliament.
It is also, the Commission points out, contemporary because it deals with issues such as bioethics, genetic engineering and data protection as well as access to information.
Those who are more backward and more reactionary have, once again, triumphed over those who are fighting to see fundamental rights applied to all people and for an effective, legally binding response to new issues such as the risks of science, the rights of the new citizens, the right to a healthy environment etc. Consequently, we are once again left disappointed and dissatisfied.
But this Charter is clearly aimed at furthering the ever-closer union of the peoples of Europe.
The Charter constitutes a balanced and solid basis for enlargement.
We must take our rights seriously if we want governments to respect them and legal systems to guarantee them.
Mr President, the Charter that is now on the table for our approval is a project we can be proud of.
Sixty thousand people are expected from the ETUC organisations alone.
In the short term, it is far more important for the European Union to give its commitment to the already existing European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe.
We must move in this direction.
I think some very skilful work has been done.
There are, however, other effects, particularly on our internal legal system.
Most worrying is the Orwellian possibility under Article 52 of the suspension of fundamental rights when the interests of the European Union are at stake.
In this respect I should like to point out that here, for the first time, a European Union document is making it perfectly clear that the rights listed in the Charter are, for the most part, applicable to all individuals regardless of nationality or even right of residence.
The Commissioner has just mentioned the spirit in which the Charter was drawn up, with a view to its being made, one day, a binding text.
Here too, in specifying a right to good administration, the Charter means to be ambitious.
Turkish citizens are realising that Turkey' s accession to the EU will require not only the 'painless' revision of their institutions but also a partial renunciation of sovereignty, to which they remain jealously attached, and a radical change in habits and outlook.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, of the two reports before us today, the one by Mr Morillon is more political in nature, whereas mine is more technical.
In this respect, I have no doubt but that the determination of each and every one of us to help Turkey progress along the path of democratisation will in the end prevail.
For its part, the Presidency would like to see this special action programme of EIB loans adopted by the Council very soon, probably as early as the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers of Economic and Financial Affairs on 27 November.
And finally, negotiations on Cyprus have been resumed under the aegis of the United Nations.
And I must say that I am convinced that the Turkish Government is firmly resolved to take a decisive approach to the reform projects needed.
I also welcome the proposals in this report on stepping up parliamentary cooperation and strengthening civil society.
Nothing has been done about abolishing the death penalty, and very little has been done to set minority and human rights on a solid legal basis, even if a few UN conventions have been signed.
Mr President, the European Liberal Group strongly welcomes the Morillon report which we find skilful, frank and forceful.
There is no one here, least of all myself, who would deny the fact that genocide was perpetrated against the Armenians during the last period of the Ottoman Empire.
Nonetheless, what we are looking for here is not just compliance with the Copenhagen criteria but compulsory democratic standards.
I fully agree with this statement, but I would say that the decision by the Helsinki European Council to grant Turkey applicant country status was not preceded by the essential debate - both public and parliamentary - that General Morillon' s explanatory statement also calls for.
We cannot play about with the dignity of nations.
The Council should consider whether granting Turkey candidate status has done more harm than good here.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
We therefore abstained.
In countries whose legislation is more favourable to workers, however, the Charter may be cited to oppose the national legislation in courts of law.
If the Charter is adopted at the forthcoming summit in Nice, either by incorporating it into the Treaties or simply by proclamation, it will be a step backwards.
Articles trampling on State competences.
Even though the countries of Europe currently find themselves in an alarming demographic position, the Charter deals extremely lightly with the problems of the family.
The Charter will involve the European Court of Justice in a number of political decisions, in fields as diverse as employment law, extradition policy, immigration and the family.
Admittedly, I personally would have preferred a Charter with a much more sizeable social component!
. (FR) I consider that the Charter of Fundamental Rights represents a valuable step forward.
The consensus method adopted by the Convention members has produced, as is generally the case when unanimity is enforced, a minimal Charter characterised by significant omissions and ambiguities.
There is no right to work, just the "right to engage in work" ; there is no right to social protection or accommodation, just "the right to social assistance and housing assistance" ; there is no right to a retirement pension or a minimum income; there is no ban on redundancies, just the "right to protection against unjustified dismissal" .
In the first place, there are discrepancies between the German and French versions which raise major questions about the references to "religious" or "spiritual" values.
It does not include the right to work or the right to housing.
We must, however, stand firmly against any campaign for a legally binding Charter that would only create legal uncertainty.
Recently our Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, clearly stated that the European Charter of Fundamental Human Rights should remain a political, not a legal document.
In the end, the haggling that this type of process inevitably leads to resulted in our weighing the notion of Europeans' "religious heritage" against the promotion of "free enterprise" .
Next, these texts are all based on initiatives by Member States, coming under either the third pillar of Article 67 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, where the Commission does not have the monopoly on the right of initiative.
The Marinho report now seeks to extend the principle of the mutual recognition of national measures for the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime, established by the Joint Action 98/699/JHA in 1998, to decisions in the pre-court phase, especially those enabling the competent authorities to take rapid action to obtain evidence and seize easily transportable assets.
It was accepted that the principle of mutual recognition should also apply to pre-trial orders, in particular to those which would enable competent authorities quickly to secure evidence and seize assets, which are easily moveable.
We welcome the French Presidency's initiative aimed at improving cooperation between national authorities responsible for tackling money laundering and laying down uniform penalties.
. While welcoming closer cooperation between the Member States' police forces both amongst themselves and through Europol, I share the rapporteur' s concerns about the lack of democratic accountability of Europol.
However, I would like to draw your attention to the possible reforms of criminal law that could take place in various Member States such as Spain, for example, with the Partido Popular in power - which is taking advantage of a certain situation - because these reforms are still a concern for the Europe of freedom and democracy.
Langenhagen Report (A5-0310/2000)
Mr President, if Turkey were a member of the EU, it would be the most populous Member State after Germany.
This is a consultation procedure, but it would be reasonable, of course, for it to be a codecision procedure because these decisions can in actual fact lead to the Budget's having to be adjusted.
That is why the frankness which runs through the Morillon report deserves special mention, although fewer excuses at some points in the report would, I think, have reflected the factors used to evaluate Turkey's progress towards accession more accurately.
And from this point of view, the report is right to condemn the bombing of Kendakor by the Turkish air force and to highlight and reiterate the Turkish Government's obligation to support negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots without preliminary conditions.
Almost 40 per cent of Cyprus is occupied by foreign troops in the form of Turkish soldiers.
And the answer is, as Mr Morillon's report makes clear, not far enough.
We want to support it on this journey, not obstruct it and, above all, we want to keep our financial promises.
How much more desirable and acceptable would be the goal of a looser community of nation-states trading freely and acting in unison over a limited range of policy areas and how much easier it would then be to accommodate a country such as Turkey.
We can but share these concerns, which were duly expressed by the Commission in its last annual report.
What is new is the accession partnership, and the accession partnership contains a very important stipulation: that the candidate country must deal with all the issues addressed in the progress report.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The fact that the situation in the Middle East is difficult at present is not, therefore, a reason to lower our ambitions for the Marseilles conference.
Great prospects are opening up, too, for cooperation in the areas of combating trafficking of all sorts, migration and enhancing the rule of law.
Today, on the eve of Marseilles, the French Presidency naturally wishes to see the European Union' s Mediterranean priority confirmed, including in financial terms.
In other words, this is not just a chance for more trade and commerce, it is security policy par excellence and this is the message which we need to get across to our citizens if this process is to gain acceptance.
It is also true that setbacks in the pre-peace process have slowed down the progress of Barcelona.
As far as human rights are concerned, we propose a structural approach looking at the performance of countries over time.
In June 2000, the Feira Council adopted a common Mediterranean strategy and, after proposing and obtaining endorsement for reform of the Meda regulation, the Commission recently tabled a document on reinvigorating the Barcelona Process.
In fact, I will go further and say that, in the past, the peace process has served as an excuse for both Europe and for the Mediterranean partners not to be more courageous.
It is far from clear.
Moreover, the dream of peace on both sides of the Mediterranean should be listened to and the wish granted at the earliest possible opportunity.
Braudel's 'Mediterranean of a thousand things' , the ancient civilisations which, for years, have regarded each other with hostility across the Basin, now have the opportunity to start afresh, setting off along a common path which, through political will and the power of dialogue, will lay the foundations for genuine progress and economic and social development.
Moreover, by continuing it can make the best possible contribution, a secondary but significant contribution, to the resumption of dialogue in the Middle East.
It is true that this Conference is going to take place in a context of violence and of a peace crisis as a result of the conflict in the Middle East, but it is also true that holding the conference will enable us to keep the flame of the Euro-Mediterranean process burning and that it should not be contaminated by the tragic conflict.
The Commission and the Council claim to want this.
Secondly, I think that we are also forgetting another important subject, which is the environment.
There is now a regulation on the table which, as I see it, equips the European Union to deliver aid in an efficient manner and on time, and to put EU funds to good use in the countries of the western Balkans.
Hence my appeal for this regulation to strike a good balance between high profile activities, i.e. large projects, on the one hand, and continued attention to projects for democracy, on the other, i.e. projects to do with security, projects that are seldom as high profile, but which are all the more necessary to guarantee stability in the Balkans.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am aware that the Balkans are not the most promising area for optimism.
We have to give more effective and more coordinated aid, gathering together all the scattered bits and pieces.
I think we all realise that a slimmer, more efficient structure is needed if the good work which the Kosovo Agency has carried out in recent months is to be consolidated for future purposes.
I think it would be counterproductive and I am certain that Mr Lang will do his utmost and if Mr Moscovici were here, he would perhaps do so too.
However, as far as I am concerned, this week' s star price goes to the leader of the Social Democrats in Bosnia, and, incidentally, to the people of Slovakia, for not falling into the referendum trap that the opposition set for the government, but that is another story.
We indeed hope that the year will end with the consolidation of democracy on 23 December during the parliamentary elections in Serbia.
Any rapprochement with the European Union is, in fact, closely linked, in the eyes of the Council, to the development of regional cooperation.
The French Presidency set itself ambitious targets as regards the Western Balkans which are close to being achieved: the development of the Stabilisation and Association Process, the adoption of the CARDS programme, the adoption of asymmetric commercial preferences, to mention but the more noteworthy Community measures.
Other objectives of the Zagreb summit must include an announcement of the Community assistance and reconstruction, democratisation and stabilisation programmes for the Western Balkans, a confirmation of the progressive establishment of a free trading zone between the European Union and the Western Balkans and a commitment by the countries in the region for regional cooperation and to putting in place a free trading regime between them.
This is essential.
For several months, Mr Baker' s mission has been twofold; he has sought both to resolve the difficulties inherent in implementing the Settlement Plan, which should lead to a referendum on self-determination for the Sahrawi people, and to reach a political agreement.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I think the EU would have far more influence in the Maghreb if there were stronger links with the reform process in Morocco.
What diplomatic initiatives will the Council take to further the rapprochement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, settle their bilateral differences, and promote cooperation between the two countries?
I understand the concerns expressed by Mr Souladakis and Mr Alavanos, but I do not have anything to add regarding the action taken by the European Union as it has been carried out.
Mr President, I welcome the Council's response to the original question.
The new legislation being drafted in Turkey, which prohibits reduced sentences, is necessary but it is even more important that Muslim leaders officially condemn 'crimes of honour', which are a direct violation of Islam.
It makes no great difference whether she has transgressed voluntarily or against her will, that is to say been raped.
The Austrian Government is the legitimate government of a country in the European Union and it is up to us whether we approve or disapprove of the way it is made up.
As regards the issue in question, I simply wanted to say that there was no discrimination being made against any particular country.
When you say that extreme right-wing parties are banned in Austria, that is all well and good, but one might also question what does or does not constitute the notion of the extreme right.
With regard to the political solution of the Cyprus question to which you referred, Mr Alavanos, it will of course continue to be an issue of debate with Turkey as we confirmed at Helsinki.
As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses.
My reply was not really meant to be a show of optimism or hope, rather the expression of a desire, the desire of the French Presidency of the European Union, to reach an agreement, a sound agreement.
It also tried to set out a calendar for negotiations.
I have a letter from the sister of another constituent of mine who draws to my attention that he has been in prison since 28 March 2000 on similar suspicion.
Given that developments in the oil markets make it necessary for the EU to adopt a more dynamic policy in the energy sector, how does the Council think it might achieve a reduction in the European economy' s dependence on oil?
The measures to which the honourable Member is referring appear in the draft budget signed by President Clinton on 28 October 2000.
I recognised that measures had been taken by the Cuban Government to better integrate their country economically into the region and reaffirmed Europe' s willingness to be Cuba' s partner in this process.
Secondly, the Council refers in its reply to NATO as Pontius Pilate, without taking a position on Turkey's provocation in contesting Greek sovereign rights, on this occasion during NATO exercises.
It is true that the European Union is often accused of promising aid to countries struck by disaster or catastrophe and then taking so long to pay it, so long to keep its financial promises that either it creates the impression that it regrets having promised it in the first place or, when it finally does pay, it is already too late.
Fourthly, and most importantly for us, new borders are being erected but they are no obstacle to the activities of criminal organisations, which know no borders.
From this point of view, I think that resurrecting an issue which was resolved about a year ago with the Pack report as far as the headquarters of the Reconstruction Agency is concerned is a disservice.
We must bear in mind that there is still a long way to go along the road to peace in the Balkans and that potential friction points still exist which could well set the whole process back again.
I want to focus on the regulations.
Seventy percent of the funds committed had been contracted and 43% of the contracted funds had been paid.
We think it makes more sense to do it there than to build it into the article on conditionality.
The language regime is a further sensitive issue.
That has been the background to these summits.
In the social and cultural field, leaders recognised the vital importance of better educational links with specific initiatives for promoting mutual awareness, including an enhancement of inter-university cooperation and electronic networking between schools.
If you take a long-term view of political and economic developments in our multi-polar world, then you will see that Asia's relations with Europe, and vice versa, are of paramount importance.
What we dislike about ASEM II is not so much what we have managed to achieve, because projects to do with money-laundering, HIV and AIDS, food safety and suchlike, are of course to be welcomed.
It is therefore a matter of priority that the European Union should equip itself with the machinery needed to ensure the full participation it deserves.
Mr President, the regional fisheries organisations are today without doubt the best, if not the only, guarantee for the management of world fish stocks, and they are likely be even more significant in the future.
There is over-fishing, pollution of our seas, the climate is changing - we see that at the conference at the Hague at the moment - and the physical alteration of the environment puts increasing pressure on these finite resources.
The law of the survival of the fittest still applies on the high seas.
Could I first of all take the opportunity to welcome the report and say that the whole issue of the management, control and the conservation of fisheries stocks is a major problem no matter where you look.
I ask the Commission to take that on board.
As far as the time taken to implement the decisions of the regional fisheries organisations is concerned, I agree that the Commission's record can and must be improved.
It is necessary, therefore, to come up with new instruments to guard against a serious crisis re-emerging despite a high level of internal consumption and good use of export opportunities.
Setting up a compensation fund will quicken the concentration of European slaughter pig production considerably because the risk of bigger capital investments will shift to the common fund.
It does not solve the cyclical instability of the sector, it breaches the principle that the CAP will provide financial support and it is clearly an example of renationalisation and distortion of competences.
If every common organisation of the market were as anti-cyclical as what Mr Garot has proposed, or if all organisations of the market were to work in favour of smaller holdings, as Mr Busk has just said, then holdings in Europe would be structured very differently.
The latest cases of BSE will result in reduced production and will eclipse everything put in place hitherto.
The participation of all Member States in this new system will be compulsory.
I am positive that this instrument will improve the stability of the market and allow farmers in Europe to manage cyclical crises more efficiently.
Pigs have always had - as has been said by Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert - tremendous highs and lows in price.
If, however, we opt for market organisation, and reinforcement of the associated policy, then we would do well, in my view, to see that the producer groupings are better equipped, so that they occupy a stronger position in the market; a market which is becoming increasingly close-knit on the demand side, and which is gaining in influence.
Other countries are determined to have a compensation fund and I will tell you quite frankly that, if we were to propose a mandatory compensation fund, we might as well forget the whole idea, because it would never obtain a majority in the Council.
But the title reads "on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat".
The different chapters of the annual report address four main concerns.
In areas where the Community programmes are implemented directly by the Commission, such as internal policy and external actions, implementation rates are somewhat lower.
In its 2001 programme, the Court has therefore planned an overall audit covering all budgetary areas of the Commission's recovery procedures.
But I find it really amazing that some Member States can refuse to accept financial responsibility, for example, in the area of customs duties, when their own authorities have made mistakes which mean that customs duties cannot be entered and they then refuse to make good this shortfall in revenue, so that instead all the Member States have to accept joint responsibility for this revenue shortfall.
The Commission has presented a paper on this to the Committee on Budgets.
When you assumed office, Mrs Schreyer, you assured us that you would strive to achieve this.
Madam President, I should first of all like to thank the Court of Auditors for its annual report.
I could have done with seeing a much more practical annual report from the Court of Auditors.
Reform of the Commission is largely about making the individual Directorates-General responsible, and I should like to ask the Court whether it has plans in future to restructure the annual report so that chapters for the individual Directorates-General are prepared.
I would therefore be grateful if you could respond to this question again.
I am pleased that the Commission has taken steps to improve its management control over Community finances, and systems are being put in place in the Member States.
Reforming the Commission is no guarantee that previously recorded irregularities will not arise in the future.
Madam President, I am grateful too that the Council have come back because I have got something to say to them as well.
Will you make a commitment to do this in future, Mr Karlsson, because a lack of clear information in the report makes it very difficult for us to put pressure in the right areas on the worst offenders.
In order to achieve this, I also wish you, Madam President, a great deal of staying power, and would like to thank you for the commitment you have already shown to date.
But you have not included that in your report, and I am sick and tired of hearing, year after year, that the Member States are responsible for 80% and the Commission for only 20%, while the report itself does not point the finger of blame!
We need to look at the way the Court works and how its independence from the institutions and the programmes it is meant to audit can be strengthened.
But it has to be recognised that we are faced with a complex system.
In both cases, this involves a limited number of countries and a limited number of economic agents, who are the direct beneficiaries of these policies.
But I should like to make it abundantly clear that a procedure of this kind has to develop very gradually so that we do not have a complete change in the method of data collation because then the value of this exercise would not meet the requirements we are set under the Treaty.
The Court entirely agrees with Parliament that it is not only a question of reform of the Commission or of Parliament reforming its way of working with financial control.
I was also thinking about Florida this morning, Mr van Hulten, and I am thankful that I was not responsible for auditing the election procedure in that specific state.
I shall give one example, one that I know the Council has some difficulties with, but which for Parliament is highly important and we wholly support it: the ban on exporting products deemed unsafe to third countries.
I am therefore deeply grateful to the PPE Group for having adopted these amendments here today and tabling them for further debate here in this Chamber.
In addition, there is the question of what the scope of current standards in Europe is and what the scope of European standards would be.
We are at first reading.
We have to look now at the links between products and services.
Incidentally, we support the Commission' s proposals concerning the extension of the directive's scope of application to include services, and also the incorporation of migrated products, even though there is certainly still a lot more that could be done in these areas, which will no doubt fall to us in the future.
In conclusion, I call upon the Commission to set in motion a coordination project within the framework of existing Community legislation and to make our legislation both more transparent and also genuinely beneficial owing to its certainty.
This is certainly positive.
The scope of the directive in relation to the wide variety of national and Community product legislation needs to be defined, as that legislation, too, covers the same safety ground.
A great deal of effort has been made to better define the interaction between vertical laws on certain categories of products and this new horizontal directive, so as to definitely achieve a satisfactory result.
However, it does not apply when specific sectoral legislation covering the same aspect applies.
I am very pleased that the report of Mrs González Álvarez endorses the main principles of the Commission proposal.
This motivation is needed in order to prevent excessive bureaucracy.
Amendment No 19 proposes harmonisation of Member States' monitoring approaches on the basis of guidelines prepared by the Commission and the consultative committee.
Amendments Nos 30, 32, 42 and the main part of Amendment No 33 propose rewordings of the existing text of the directive which is not subject to revision.
If the checks confirm that the product is safe, the ban will automatically be lifted.
Before we proceed to the vote, I wish to inform you that Mr Claudio Martelli of the Technical Group of Independent Members has now joined the Mixed Group, that is he has switched from the Technical Group to the Mixed Group.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Unfortunately we are not in a position to welcome that yet.
The delays in implementing the agreements can only be partly justified.
- I welcome this report by Mr Averoff on a proposal to grant funds to Greece in order to relieve the interest burden on EIB loans for the reconstruction of the Attica region which was devastated by the earthquake of September 1999.
But all the declarations concerning 'equal opportunities for men and women' are cast in a rather garish light by the European directive authorising night work for women.
We would have liked to have scrutinised the fourth action programme just as we are now considering the fifth programme.
As this NGO plays an integral role in the formation and implementation of this programme, I believe the integrity of this Community framework strategy on gender equality is in question, and therefore unsupportable.
- Whilst I support this report on general product safety, it is important that we do not go too far.
We fully support this approach and the two proposals for Council regulations which would implement it. But we cannot support the amendments tabled by the European Parliament which aim to profoundly upset the balance of the system in favour of the Commission.
Mr President, I voted for the report although it does not distinguish clearly enough between Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro.
- (SV) We are not in favour of new subsidies for pig feed and are therefore voting against the report.
The Garot report is an attempt to improve on some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, by seeking to reach a compromise with the Council, specifically with regard to a financial contribution to the fund.
- (NL) The pigmeat market is cyclical.
This House is always talking about rights - the Charter was adopted yesterday - but when it comes to the application of these rights, not so much in practical terms but at least in terms of upholding them, Parliament takes alarming steps backwards which are certainly no credit to it.
It is extraordinary that the European Parliament should be expressing an opinion on Turkey' s progress on the road to accession, especially when it comes to respect for human rights.
At a time when the last witnesses of exile, the last survivors of the carnage, are quietly passing away, the work and the duty of remembrance are even more necessary.
This once again raises the question of whether Turkey really wants to be a Member of the European Union, or whether it would prefer to organise an integrated 'whole' with other Middle East countries, which would have very close links with the European Union at the commercial and economic level, at the security and stability level and also at the human rights and democratic rules level.
These countries came under Turkey' s dominion in the past, and uprisings that took place there were repeatedly suppressed using violent means.
We cannot forget the deportation of the entire Armenian population to the deserts of Mesopotamia, the deportation of the Armenians of eastern Anatolia in 24 hours, the shooting of able-bodied men, the persecution of women, children and old people, who covered hundreds of kilometres on foot, without medical care and without food, divested of their belongings, raped, their throats slit on the open road, the deportation in 1915 of the Armenians of Cilicia and eastern Anatolia, the assassination of 600 Armenian prominent citizens in Constantinople, the extermination of more than a million Armenians in just over a year - in other words, almost half the Ottoman Armenians.
We opposed the amendments on the Armenian massacre for exactly this reason.
On the whole, our interests are undermined, they are not defended with the necessary force, and the role of the Commission is primarily that of a police officer vis-à-vis Member States to get them to apply the binding decisions that have been adopted, sometimes in spite of themselves, in the regional organisation in question.
- (FR) Without going back to the excellent argument put forward by Mr Gallagher regarding the text that has been submitted to the vote, I would like to extend the debate to cover all cases where our countries are represented by the executive Commission in international negotiations.
A small subject grew into an extensive piece of work owing to the fact that proposals on hazardous and non-hazardous waste were combined in a single directive.
Fortunately, there is talk of progress on the technological front, where the emphasis must be on sustainability.
Nonetheless, we are satisfied with this third reading, because it reinforces the operation authorisation conditions.
I believe this will prove to be a significant contribution to improving the environment.
It is essential that we do not replace one unhealthy and unsustainable form of waste disposal with another.
I am very happy about that, as the job I had as a new member having come directly to the second reading was not easy.
Public access to information has improved.
The operation of social systems is directly affected by certain general trends including the unemployment and social exclusion generated by 25 years of low economic growth, which has restricted the overall potential tax yield, the ageing of the population, the consequence of the emergence of new diseases and, finally, increased health care costs due to advances in medical research and treatment.
This will preferably be in the form of proposals for recommendations to include the following points: recognition by Member States of a common concept of a universal service to govern the basic service which will enable every European citizen to have access to the necessary care; establishing, in agreement with the private insuring bodies, guaranteed respect for the principle of non-discrimination; organising a system of pooling costs in order to cover the costs of persons and groups with serious existing diseases, and encouraging private insurers to develop preventative measures.
One of the main objectives of the current modernisation of social protection is guaranteed access to affordable health protection.
This is important if we want a social Europe that sets us apart from others.
However, the individual country must decide for itself what arrangements it prefers.
I turned to the health service and was told that I had to wait three weeks for an examination and then at least a further month for a crucial operation.
If more and more Europeans turn to supplementary health insurance in order to reimburse health care costs, the mutualist sector will remain the best guarantee for equal access to care.
In particular, these sentiments are to be found in recital J and Paragraphs 11 e) and f) and 14 of this report.
I also feel that the increase in labour mobility in Europe is necessary and lends weight to our argument in favour of producing the aforementioned Green Paper and measures on the cost of public health.
But above all he draws attention, for example in Paragraph 3, to the significant problems regarding the long-term sustainability of public health care systems throughout the EU because of the increasing cost of advances in treatment possibilities, as well as the growing demand from an increasingly elderly population.
In this sense, I think that, basically, we should await the Commission study on current systems as well as a Commission study on the American system and the schemes in operation in other countries because then we shall have a clearer picture of all this.
I have to say, even, that I am rather taken over by the subject for, to my eyes, Mr President, you resemble a chief physician, with a white coat, stethoscope and hammer to test the patient's reflexes.
In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I would once again like to stress that the present report concerns supplementary health insurance and not health care as such, although obviously the two cannot be separated.
It is a classic example of socialist interventionism.
However, these figures are somewhat misleading since both the concept and the coverage of the system differ significantly from country to country.
Whilst there are considerable differences between the various Member States, the most serious situation is definitely that of Portugal, with around 24% of the population living below the poverty line due primarily to low salaries, insecure and badly paid jobs and pensions and benefits so low that they do not enable workers and their families or the elderly to live with a minimum of dignity.
Any complaints about this from the Commission are therefore unfounded as far as Parliament is concerned, if this technical support is to be included in the programme itself.
Updating the stability programmes in Germany, Finland and the Netherlands
More and more Member States are reaching balanced or even clearly positive budgetary positions.
In the case of the Netherlands, the Commission has other concerns, such as the suitability of the policy mix and the risks associated with the fiscal incentive effects of the tax cuts in a situation of strong economic growth, which might lead to the Netherlands economy overheating.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are grateful to you for your report on trends in net government borrowing in the European Union, Mr Solbes Mira.
Mr President, I too am heartened to see that public finances in the countries concerned are sound, but I have noticed that more and more people are becoming nervous about the situation regarding price stability in Europe.
I would like to know, Commissioner, whether the Commission can tell us anything about this.
The Council of the European Union is also playing an active role, in concert with the European Parliament and the European Commission, in updating and constantly reinforcing Europe' s raft of measures to prevent and combat this disease.
The methods of control will be strengthened along the entire food chain.
The European Food Agency will also provide clear and accessible information on issues arising out of its mandate.
If these controls are respected and implemented, the risk to the public is reduced to a minimum.
The Commission view that targeted testing is essential in establishing a true picture of the real incidence of BSE in the Community has been fully vindicated by the test results in France.
Specified risk materials must be removed and destroyed.
Let me add a few comments on what I said earlier in this respect.
I welcome in this respect that Prime Minister Jospin yesterday also announced a substantial strengthening of controls on the food chain including a big increase in staff.
But implementation by the Member States has still been too slow.
I will tell you exactly what we need, ladies and gentlemen - we need two things.
In a situation such as that which has now arisen in France, and also earlier on in many other countries, it is important to be able to tell consumers where the products they buy come from and how their origins can be traced.
Today, Mr Böge, those who are claiming they have no incidence of mad cow disease on their territory are those who are not looking for it.
It is therefore urgent that measures are taken to reassure consumers and to restore their confidence in food safety.
I will not detail the horrors that have been committed on all sides.
The measures adopted by the French Government in this regard are, as I said, inadequate.
Well, the thing with poor agreements is that they should be challenged, especially when public health dictates this.
But, faced with the crisis, it is necessary to guarantee health and food protection for consumers and an income for livestock producers, butchers, tripe butchers and wholesalers alike, all of whom are victims of the negligence of the public authorities, at both national and Community level.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this debate has one thing in its favour; that at least it is highlighting the differences of opinion that exist among us, especially between the Council and the Commission.
A reform of the CAP is not just necessary, it is indispensable, because it is intolerable that a European country should adopt draconian measures and jeopardise its economy.
Had that happened, we would not now be complaining that we have been put in an undesirable category just because we asserted that we were BSE-free.
We call for financial subsidies to assist breeders so that they do not have to bear all the costs of the crisis.
I would remind you though, that no human being can go without food, not for a single day.
Mr Byrne did not say very much today, as he was widely trailed to have done, about testing.
Firstly, to respond to the justified and very demanding need of European consumers for food safety, we are going to place the bar of controls and precautions at an extremely high level.
If you would only implement what we agreed, then you would not need to worry about all this any more.
Therefore, consumers and producers must unite to obtain greater guarantees of the inviolable principle that food should be healthy.
Let me assure you that, if we had had the political will then, we would not be facing this problem now, because we all know what has caused it.
Secondly, there is the question as to whether it is acceptable to use bonemeal in cattle feed, which has been the subject of lively debate here in this Chamber.
There are increasing incidences, also in my own country, of dead sheep or calves simply being left behind because it costs too much to have them collected.
The British system of removing infected animals from the herds and paying good compensation for those animals encourages farmers to declare their cases of BSE.
Commissioner Byrne was very strong today in his opening statement when he said to the House that he was prepared to look at this matter of meat-and-bone meal and take it on.
To this end I listened most attentively to all your speeches, and it seems to me appropriate and crucial that the debate on the safety of our citizens is settled at the European level.
What we must bear in mind when considering this issue is the fact that there is already in existence a ban on the provision of meat-and-bone meal to cattle.
The tests that I am referring to now are somewhat different.
The recent spate of instances in which various Member States have failed to respect the most basic human rights when expelling immigrants is such as to warrant special attention for this issue from the Commission.
Mr President, I wish to state that I share Mrs Cerdeira Morterero' s concerns and that I hope she is not only addressing her appeal to the Commission, but also to the Council, so that we may have the entire legal framework adopted by next June.
What measures does the Commission intend to take to put a stop to this intolerable situation of shameful exploitation, abuse and the white slave trade, and to eliminate all discrimination against women?
Does the Commission intend to take any steps at least to put an end to the current diversity of opinion which is so prejudicial to the euro?
Ladies and gentlemen, please begin with the question and not with the explanation.
The Commission has therefore sent a recent opinion to the Greek authorities.
If values are exceeded, the Member State, in this case Greece, will have to take action.
In its decision to approve the French scheme of supporting film production, the Commission set four specific compatibility criteria.
But I do not think we should be satisfied just with what has been achieved.
Firstly, by improving our understanding of exclusion by establishing an indicator and evaluation criteria directed at target groups in particular.
We are told that finding paid work is the best way of preventing social exclusion but I would agree with those who have said that we would have to take account of the fact that gainful employment alone is no guarantee of social participation.
It may be true of older people whose knowledge is no longer needed.
Where this has been achieved, even in Europe, unemployment has fallen convincingly.
Furthermore, according to the EU's statistical service, 18% of European citizens live below the poverty line, while one-third of those living in poverty are working.
Every year, my friends Mr Thomas Mann and Mr Mario Mantovani and I go to the Poor Sisters' institute in Brussels to serve meals to the town's poor tramps, and our hearts bleed and we feel guilty that we are only able to do this once a year: we would like to be able to do it every day but, in all honesty, it would be impossible.
This is an ambitious programme of Community action which, in line with the Commission' s proposal, will be given budgetary appropriations of EUR 70 million and should remain in force for a period of five years.
Mr President, I will end by stressing once again that mutual support between States must be the reference point upon which we base a fresh fight against poverty and social exclusion, but we must take into account the fact that the economic progress of the Member States, and therefore an improvement in their welfare due to the implementation of a social economy of scale, will certainly facilitate the achievement of a greater, better system of social justice.
I also agree on the importance of improving understanding of social exclusion and poverty and of promoting comparable indicators and assessment criteria.
But I would like to make the following pragmatic suggestion in response to your concerns because I entirely agree that we must find a way to have close and continuous cooperation.
Promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources
But we do not have that much time!
And one more thing I want to make crystal clear: waste incineration is not a renewable energy source and cannot therefore be counted towards meeting the targets.
We consider that, if these guidelines are not modified, the environmental impact they will cause will be highly negative.
Colleagues, this directive makes sense.
Since the plea by the Advocate-General before the Court of Luxembourg, there is now less risk of seeing guaranteed prices foiled by state-aid regulations.
We are not trying to deceive others into believing that carbon dioxide is reduced by burning peat, but it is our own fuel, while oil and gas are imported goods.
Oil cannot be replaced by coal, natural gas or uranium.
We favour a shorter period followed by a review, and I would say to my colleague, Mrs McNally, that she paints a pretty picture of windmills in the sea, but I must tell her that the engineering difficulties and the costs involved make that technology, as with electricity from the sun, rather a long way off in the future.
This directive does, of course, take the desired line in that here, at last, is genuine exploitation of renewable energies.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for her valuable work in drafting this report.
Our objectives in the field of sustainable energy are ambitious, yet still modest in the context of the climate problems we face.
Mr President, let there be no doubt a combination of investments in renewables and energy efficiency is the only realistic way for the European Union to meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and reduce our heavy dependence on fossil fuels.
We must vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposals from Mrs Rothe.
With regard to our targets in this field, we have to listen to the people and go beyond the Commission' s proposal of 21%, which I think is very positive overall, and increase the renewable portion of the total electricity produced.
Amendments Nos 1, 2, 8, 20 and 21 highlight the need for a policy favourable to green electricity and its many advantages and can be immediately accepted by the Commission.
We therefore support Amendments Nos 36 and 56 and also certain aspects of Amendments Nos 4, 15 and 62, relating to the idea of internalising external costs and compensating for external costs which are not covered in favour of renewable energy sources.
Gender-related aspects of armed conflicts
Women must participate fully in all peace negotiations, in all reconstruction work and in peace-keeping operations.
The situation is also particularly difficult for women, however, if they still have to fight for recognition and for equal rights in practice.
The aversion some men in this House have shown towards having a serious discussion of this issue means the writing is on the wall.
There could also be training in involving NGOs and in developing facilities for people affected by crises etc. We could subsequently hold hearings, seminars etc. on these subjects.
We agree that rapes, forced pregnancy, forced sterilisation and any other type of sexual violence should be recognised as crimes against humanity, and legal texts should therefore be updated to protect women effectively.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Once again, my congratulations, and let us hope that something comes of it.
The report not only refers to the social exclusion of women as a problem in itself, it also rightly emphasises that protection against criminality and personal safety are no longer something that can be guaranteed solely within national borders.
In this field there has been nothing but shameful failures but nevertheless we are still faced with a brick wall which excludes women.
In her eagerness to oppose everything that is evil, systematic rape and sexual slavery are condemned.
The fourth example is the important role of women in the peace process which the European Community is supporting in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean basin.
Mr President, we are now descending to the level of a more everyday problem, namely the regulation of domestic work performed by third parties in private families, for that is the subject under discussion.
Finally, all this will inevitably involve financial intervention from the government, be it fiscal or parafiscal, because a private family would not be able to afford a full statute, even a limited one, and then they would all carry on taking people from the black market.
The workers, mostly women, should be provided with access to training.
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur.
Mr President, Commissioner, domestic helps, who were formerly almost exclusively employed by more wealthy households, nowadays provide much-needed and essential support for working men and women and, above all, for single mothers and the elderly.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, we are very much looking forward to your address and we hope it will trace out the paths of our rediscovered cooperation and brotherhood, which we will henceforth be travelling along together.
Not only are we to carry out privatisation of our centralised economy, but also create a legal system that would guarantee the freedom of business operations and the entire economic process.
When it comes to relations between Serbia and Montenegro within the federal state, the former, non-democratic organisation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia seriously threatened the functioning of the state.
Then your brave predecessors embarked on an uncertain project that bore historic fruit.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Mr President, what I have to say concerns rather the future than the past, in other words, I would just like to make sure that we are to vote on the BSE issue in today' s vote.
At the beginning of this part-session I even submitted a complete proposed initiative to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Obviously there have to be limits to such a right, and that is something we are also discussing today.
Mr President, the right of Members of Parliament to confidential documents is a very important issue, but it cannot replace the direct right of access to information on the part of the public.
These are the considerations that led the Committee on Budgetary Control to deliver an opinion under this procedure.
What they learn is at the media' s discretion or depends upon special interest groups, and they often feel powerless over and against the institutions.
However, the issue here is the public's, not Parliament's, access to documents.
We have therefore reduced them to six.
Furthermore, a report must be sent to Parliament every year so that we might continually follow up this action.
The stipulations concerning the duty of the Commission and the Council to provide Parliament with information, have no place in this legislative proposal.
In other words, as I see it, a link has been established - erroneously so - between the rights of parliamentarians and the rights of the public.
Our concerns are threefold: the first is regarding the common foreign and security policy sectors, but also the sectors of justice and home affairs.
In principle this regulation is positive, especially the clarification that it covers all areas of activity and all the institutions of the Union.
I call on you to pressure the Council into changing its mind and, at the same time, I call on you to vote in favour of the Cashman report.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and everyone else involved in this work.
Finally, so many documents are kept secret even from the Members of Parliament that many of the facts we would need in order to reach a decision remain so hidden that...
We Members should be more courageous.
It would be better to create provisions in the paragraphs themselves, which would oblige all bodies to publish their documents and create registers on them.
This gap is symbolic of the distance between the European Union and its citizens.
I would also like to say how much the Commission and myself appreciate the efforts made by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, and the draftsperson of the proposal, Mrs Maij-Weggen, to present this report in such a short period of time.
I believe that this demonstrates that there are no perfect situations and that we all have to make progress in order to prevent situations of this type.
I include here amendments such as those tabled on measures which must be agreed by means of an interinstitutional agreement: Amendments Nos 34, 45, and 48.
I am making this comment because as a rule the Commissioner present gives the Commission' s voting recommendations orally.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
We, in the committee, cautiously accept the role proposed by the Commission for external ratings, with the reservation that this is a role with limitations - most importantly, small businesses will not need to be rated, nor will businesses without a rating be disadvantaged.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0318/2000), by Mr Cashman, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents [COM(2000) 30 - C5-0057/2000 - 2000/0032(COD)]
The majority of the women will be travelling to a conference of Members of Parliament in Berlin.
Mrs Villiers' report deserves better than to be voted on tomorrow morning.
I will go along with this, but had you gone down the list in the right order and not had the vote on the Cashman report first, because a number of people are absent this evening - for that is the reason - then there would still have been time to vote on the Smet report.
Mr Mann, your first comment will naturally be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Bureau and the Conference of Presidents.
. (EL) The Commission and the Council of the European Union have a great deal to answer for as regards the proportions which the issue of BSE has assumed.
Turning to the substance of the matter, my group recommended extremely stringent measures to fight this epidemic.
Moreover, the ambiguous wording of Paragraph 4 is bound to raise questions about the resolve of the authorities to oppose, by all possible means, the fraud and swindling of the agri-food trusts, when it would have been so much simpler to say in a few words that the production and use of meat-and-bone meal are totally forbidden.
The CAP must make public health its top priority.
The cases of BSE which have arisen in France, in the same way as the dioxins in chickens issue in Belgium, are the latest in a long series of irresponsible incidents.
It is crucial to resume the negotiations in the WTO so as to enable European farmers to increase their production of vegetable-based proteins.
The Commission is clearly envisaging no more than half-way measures, which will take away from and not add to the countries with the most stringent safety, whereas, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it should be giving Member States back the freedom of action they need to protect their people effectively, to ensure their safety, taking account of public opinion in their country, the political resolve there, the scale of the epidemic in their country and the place of the sectors involved in that country' s economy and their society.
These are very legitimate concerns and they have led Parliament to be very vigilant and to table amendments aimed at establishing very stringent controls over everything connected with the process of incineration and co-incineration.
All these measures reflect changing public opinions on the issue of waste management.
new forms of exclusion are included, such as exclusion from the information society,
I welcome this initiative, which responds to the expectations of our fellow citizens, the citizens of Europe.
This will be achieved by setting specific objectives to be integrated into national action plans and implementing policies to promote equal opportunities.
Although we are seeing strong economic growth and a fall in unemployment, in the modern world work offers no protection against exclusion.
The British Labour Government has been leading the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
Billions are paid out in subsidies to the few who are ruining the countryside with their wind turbines.
The Member States must now pursue the same line and respect the environmental objectives they endorsed both at European level and at international level, but they must also ensure their independence as regards energy and security of supplies.
The importance of nuclear energy is increasing constantly, for this very reason.
Nuclear energy can cause disasters capable of rendering large parts of the earth uninhabitable, and produces a hazardous waste product.
It is urgently necessary to breathe new life into the interparliamentary dialogue (ASEP) between Europe in the west and Asia in the east.
We feel that regional integration is a crucial instrument for promoting the three fundamental objectives that I have just mentioned.
I believe that four years ago - Mr Salafranca perhaps remembers this better - we held a meeting, called by IRELA, in Antigua, a beautiful city in Guatemala, where we debated along with our colleagues from Parlacen what the future should be, not only of Parlacen, but also of the European Parliament.
I therefore believe that we have to flatly reject the self-interested criticisms of those people who brand the activity of the Central American Parliament an artificial system and accuse it of being a cardboard parliament which is hollow and devoid of substance.
In this context, the Commission is taking action and we have specific projects for each of those three areas.
(B5-0849/2000) by Rod and Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;
That is precisely the point of our resolution.
It is also impossible to envisage lasting peace in the country without religious and ethnic tolerance.
But above all, we must, in my view, insist much more firmly on this racist constitution being declared null and void.
After all, he drew the nationalist card too.
All we can do is ensure that these are free and peaceful elections, and hope that the new Ivoirian government has a broad democratic basis. This is what is needed to restore ethnic harmony and help this country out of its economic morass.
For the same reason, it is tolerating all the villainies of its protégés who run the Ivoirian State, provided they protect French interests in return.
Human rights
The number of political prisoners appears to have risen from 1,500 to 3,000 very recently, many of whom are forced to carry out hard labour and are subject to cruel forms of torture.
The problem of course, is what should we, as the European Union, do now?
Mr President, for many years I have had a poster on the wall of my office of Aung San Suu Kyi when she was awarded the Sakharov Prize by this Parliament.
Large numbers are under arrest or are being harassed, and attempts have been made to close down their offices in Burma.
After all, the West has had a certain level of involvement in the country.
So the European Union must begin to take a firm stance towards Vietnam and raise the issue of the rule of law and not just - I repeat - the issue of human rights, where there have been some signs of improvement.
I would just ask you to approach this matter with delicacy, and I hope you will pardon me this misuse of my speaking time on the question of Vietnam.
The war between these two countries has not led to lasting bitterness.
President Clinton would do well to raise this matter during his present visit to Hanoi.
Since then, Vietnam has pursued an open-door external policy, and that is why that country occupies the place that it deserves within our international relations.
After all, we know what the issue is.
This, of course, will be of small consolation to those living with filthy water running through their houses and who might be facing enormous financial loss.
This is undoubtedly true.
It is not fair that people should experience tragedies of this proportion and then face a very uncertain future when, given the climatic changes already taking place, there is an absolute certainty that the problems they have experienced over the last couple of weeks will recur, if not next year, then certainly in the years that follow.
It is therefore these industries which ought to be making a major effort to reduce emissions.
Thank you, Commissioner.
So we should now be voting on this highly important text in the presence of only 171 MEPs, which is the number just counted.
I respect the remarks you made and can assure you that they will be recorded in the Minutes.
The ÅU attaches greater importance to the principle of the free provision of services than to the right to heath and medical care, methodically and systematically undermining the public health system, especially in the medical care sector, by disgracefully promoting private forms of insurance as a 'necessary' complement to and/or substitute for the public-sector system of social protection.
In fact, despite the very legitimate recitals on the rights acquired within the existing systems, seeking to give all citizens a high level of protection, regardless of their personal resources and the individual risks incurred, which also highlight the risks of transfer from public to private schemes, and outline the growing involvement of the latter in overall expenditure and the resulting inequalities, all the practical proposals set out in the resolution do nothing but promote the faster growth of private insurance schemes throughout the Community.
Everyone is being compelled just to think of their own interests, and to start attending to all kinds of unnecessary financial matters.
Own funds of banks (continuation)
That is the only way to create equal conditions of competition.
But what we could find surprising is its very existence, and the existence of the Commission' s new initiative here.
We are in favour of matching the own capital held to cover credit risks more closely with the economic risk level and further developing the rules on own funds.
Mr President, in the first place, I would point out that the Commission is pleased to see that Mrs Villiers' report relates not only to the evaluation of the Own Resources Directive but also to the current revision of the changes to the regulations concerning capital adequacy.
We ought to support these objectives by means of sound and prudent standards which guarantee the security of our markets and institutions.
The debate is closed.
Given that we will soon have to apply ourselves in this Parliament to fundamental changes to the statute of the European Ombudsman, which are still being discussed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to whose report I have been given access and which addresses the issue of extending the Ombudsman' s powers of investigation, we will wait until then for a complete, qualitative revision of the text of that statute.
The Ombudsman's office certainly helps to redress that democratic deficit.
The debate is closed.
It is her opinion in particular that I want to draw attention to as I speak tonight.
Mr President, Mr Bösch has drawn up an excellent report and we thank him for it, as we do Mrs Hautala, representing the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The rapporteur, Herbert Bösch, from the Committee on Petitions, states in the explanatory statement in his report that the principles that led to the Ombudsman' s recommendations proved to be the same as those adhered to by the European Parliament: correctness, transparency and the desire to create confidence.
The Ombudsman's initiative and recommendations can therefore be warmly welcomed, as can the decision by the Commission to follow them.
We could summon anyone in the country before the Ombudsman committee, and the select committee procedure which I will discuss in two minutes is something that we could learn from.
Unlike the Member States, with their long history, the European Union has only a short past, which is why it must create the expectation of something new.
Finally, the Commission can obviously make a commitment on its own behalf.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
One way to win a vote is to turn up when your opponents do not.
. (IT) I voted for the Villiers report on the own funds of banks, for it is imperative for Directive 89/299/EEC, which regulated the matter a good 11 years ago, to be updated and supplemented.
We support the demand for a solution to be found to the conflict between the United States and the EU, produced by the discriminatory Gramm-Leach-Bliley legislation.
I would thank the Bavarian and German ministers of the interior, as well as former Austrian Minister of the Interior Schlögel, who together made this possible back in Tampere.
Naturally priority should be given to the countries with which the European Union is conducting accession negotiations.
After 110 days of detention a person, if not tried, must be released and never tried for that offence again.
To take just one point, Mr Posselt writes of 'providing training sessions for senior national police officers on the basis of common standards'.
Mrs Karamanou has just stated that she welcomes the fact that Parliament will have an advisory role, and yet, only the other day, the Group of the Party of European Socialists voted against a motion on the grounds that the Europol Management Board was to include Members of Parliament with the right to vote.
No-one in the UK would ever have believed a soothsayer from that period who warned that it would all end up in Dixon of Dock Green whistling "Ode to Joy" and working out how to apply the European approach to policing down at the nick.
Parliament can be proud that the proposal to set up this academy originated here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese presidency for taking it up and the Commission and Council for their support.
We see that the police in one country react totally differently to the same situation than the police in another country.
Above all, I wish to emphasise that, as someone who has always advocated the idea of community policing, which is the method employed in the United Kingdom, I would welcome the fact that this British idea is finding ever more support in a range of countries in so-called "continental Europe" .
As MEPs, we ourselves are very often concerned by crime.
Moreover, it would be flexible in its organisation, offering great potential for development, with the possibility of training programmes being held at the best qualified national institute for each aspect.
I have worked on these issues for over six years and, very much thanks to the help and resources of the European Parliament, have had several significant successes in recovering children who have been abducted.
It is nevertheless a matter for regret that the scope of this regulation is limited, since it does not cover the families of unmarried couples, in which there are children born outside of marriage, whose rights will not, as a result, be recognised and enforced under Community law.
That is a task for the future.
But I have many more objections to tackling legal weaknesses and setting precedents in ways that leave social problems permanently unsolved.
Mr President, I do not doubt for one minute Commissioner Vitorino's commitment to this issue.
The Commission feels that the Treaty establishing the European Community that is currently in force enables account to be taken of the specific nature of sport in general and of its social function in particular.
I recognise their commitment and determination to do that and, of course, that sport and especially football are big business and cannot expect to be exempt from the normal rules of business.
The European Parliament has often expressed its concern with regard to drugs and called for more effective action to counter their use.
That concludes this item.
This proposal is particularly hard and vexatious for Ireland.
What we need to get clear today is that the UK is proposing what it is doing in full recognition that it must consult the European Union and in full recognition that there is EU legislation in place that it must abide by.
I very much hope that will be one result of this.
I listened to Mr McCartin earlier and it is evident he has got the wrong end of the stick.
The local haulier in Denmark or in the UK will get his full money's worth 365 days a year, but the foreign haulier from another Member State entering that country - maybe for one or two days or ten days or even 100 days - will not.
Unfortunately, our democracies have been sent a new message of violence in the form of the particularly heinous murder of Ernest Lluch.
You are aware that we have a very full agenda and I have therefore taken this decision by virtue of the powers accorded me under the Rules of Procedure in order to ensure the smooth running of parliamentary business.
After intensive negotiations, both at technical and ministerial level, on the basis of draft decisions with approximately 500 square brackets, it was not possible to reach a comprehensive agreement on key political issues.
In the end, however, the concessions obtained from other parties on "supplementarity" , compliance and the Kyoto mechanisms were insufficient to compensate for the weakening of emission-reduction targets, that would have been the result if the proposal on "sinks" had been accepted.
They were, in a sense, an accident waiting to happen - like the Titanic and the iceberg.
CO2 emissions are on the increase here too; we know that, and we have discussed it often enough.
Madam President, the conference on the world climate may have broken down but substantial progress was made nonetheless.
Fortunately, 14 of the 15 Ministers for the Environment were of the same mind on this issue.
The European Union made an error of judgement where the second view is concerned, because the green Environment Ministers of France and Germany were not prepared to forget Kyoto.
This Kyoto protocol must not be watered down under any circumstances.
If we could reach an agreement with the United States which allows them to work towards a lower realisation percentage in their own country, this would always be preferable to having no agreement at all.
Let us conclude, however, on a hopeful note.
We have repeatedly said ourselves that no agreement is better than a bad agreement, but that does not mean that we should make our own political wish list the yardstick of a sound agreement.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the European Parliament delegation to COP­VI, I wish to begin by expressing my pleasure at the excellent relationship that has developed between the Commission and Parliament over this last week.
Now is the time to decide that we cannot fail once more.
We opened up discussions on what we had earlier said were big loopholes, or potentially of big loopholes.
We are pleased to welcome Mr Hubert Védrine.
Good progress has been made on qualified majority voting, which could be extended to another thirty areas, if some Member States make the effort to confirm this.
There is perceptible movement - I say that with caution because several Member States may not yet have determined their final position - but support has begun to emerge for a simple reweighting whose exact scope and conditions remain to be defined, of course.
They have even arranged for the Council to continue through Sunday if that is absolutely essential.
At the Nice meeting there will be an exchange of views with all the candidate countries on the reform of the European Union' s institutions, and more generally on the outlook for the future of Europe.
In this sphere, following on from Lisbon, the French Presidency made the adoption of the social agenda one of its priorities.
Finally, we have prepared a statement for the European Council on the specific economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social functions in Europe.
(Applause)Member States naturally find it politically difficult to give up the right of veto in sensitive areas such as social policy, asylum and immigration, common trade policy, cohesion and taxation, even when this relates only to the technical changes necessary to make the single market work.
We also believe that, with regard to issues on which we fail to agree to majority decision-making at this stage, you could lay down in the Treaty that the switch to majority voting may be made by a unanimous decision of the Council, for if it is enshrined in the Treaties in that way, there will be no need to revise the Treaties and engage in a lengthy ratification process for each and every extension of majority voting.
Secondly, we believe that there should not only be progress with regard to qualified majority voting, but that there should always be codecision in relation to legislative issues.
My appeal to you, Mr President-in-Office, is to present us in this Parliament a document worthy of this Parliament's assent and a document worthy of the scale of the historic challenge we face in Europe.
I say this today, if the bar is compromised and is too low, we will refuse to consider it and we will do so for Europe and we will do it in good conscience.
This would be a very important position for Parliament to adopt, and we will be able to vote on it tomorrow.
It is highly like that, on the last night of the Council, measures will be adopted which our national parliaments will not have discussed properly and which they will then be required to ratify for the sake of a forced compromise.
There are still 65 categories of legislation requiring unanimity according to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
In democracies, it is the other way around.
It is therefore no way to tackle the fact that the decision-making process within the European Union is still akin to wading through treacle.
As practically everyone who has spoken before me here has said, we want a reference to the Charter in Article 6.2. Do not underestimate Parliament' s determination to achieve this.
Its voice would be stronger yet and that of the ministers defending an agriculture that promotes sustainable development would also be stronger within the Council if it were to be based on decisions taken in this place under the codecision procedure.
Mr President, I was involved in securing Denmark' s positive vote against the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992.
Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, today at talks in the House, the President of Latvia directed this reproachful remark at us: "We have been doing our homework!
I should like to emphasise that the population of Europe consider themselves to be represented in the European Parliament, and Parliament must reflect this.
Mr President, even Paris is divided over Nice.
The Charter does not deserve to be left in a vacuum, with no clear status.
It takes no great genius to work out that 700 Members of Parliament can no longer be sufficient for a Europe of 27 or 28 nations, or the smaller countries will be at an unfair disadvantage.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, As soon as Nice has finished, it will the European Parliament's turn to reply to two historic questions, questions which affect both the future of the European Union and its own political credibility.
That is, of course, important and I am surprised that others have not mentioned it as it has occupied much of our time in the committee.
We are aware, from the speeches made by President Chirac in this place in July, that at least three major topics stand out, namely the simplification of the Treaties, the sharing of jurisdiction between European, national and regional levels, what I might term the rights of states in the American expression (Section 10 of the American Constitution), and, thirdly, the balance between the institutions - though here we should especially, perhaps, consider the role of the national parliaments - i.e. how is our institution to be managed in future.
It is nothing to be afraid of.
As far as extending qualified majority voting is concerned, we are agreed that, unless we make some sort of move in this direction, we shall encounter a great many problems.
The story of Mrs Vike Freiberga is illustrative of the courage in adversity shown by the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe.
As Mrs Berès said, it is of course untenable to draw a distinction and give us codecision rights in consumer affairs on the one hand, but at the same time, only give us consultation rights in agricultural matters.
To hear Mr Bonde talk, the Balkans is his ultimate ideal.
This time, however, it is paradoxically the prospect of an emerging consensus that is causing us political headaches.
Mr President, we Members of Forza Italia and the European People's Party believe in this project and we will be protagonists alongside you in the construction of a Europe of the citizens.
Once we had reached agreement on a text - and this is a good text, very well drafted by the Convention, it reads well, it has style - some countries then said we must incorporate it into Article 6.
In developing the idea that it would be advantageous in the future to have a Commission that was not too large to be effective and retained its full capabilities, especially its power of initiative, we demonstrated that we too were ready to make that sacrifice.
Thank you again and I know we can find the solution together.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, I would be grateful if you would report back to the House on the points that I have raised.
Mr President, I was not aware of this incident.
I can inform you that Mrs Fontaine - this has just been communicated to me and I should like to echo the sentiment on behalf of the Bureau - deeply deplores this grave incident.
Mr President, there was an extremely serious occurrence in Italy yesterday.
This excellent initiative was repeated this year and the second forum will be held on 12 and 13 December in Paris, which is to say at the same time as the European Parliament' s part-session in Strasbourg.
Mr Gorostiaga, I am going to interrupt you there.
At the same time, we also agree that the sequence of responses is correct.
Things do not often turn out that way, Minister, and we are delighted.
There is so much more to say, but I want the Council' s representatives to know that the European Parliament is keen to adopt this unfamiliar culture of security and defence, and we hope the Nice Summit is a great success.
The institutional aspects are also extremely important, because they will allow the Union to make plans, to take decisions and to act; in other words, to take political control and maintain strategic leadership of a crisis management operation.
As Mr Brok hopes in his report, the Council will have files summarising all of the relationships between the Union and each partner country, in order to gain greater benefit from the Union' s overall effort, to increase its efficiency and to provide better preparation for its discussions on external action.
This is the context that explains why the summit held recently in Zagreb was so important.
The French Presidency has striven to develop relations between the Union and the other great regional blocs and has held many meetings with Asian countries. There has been the third ASEM Summit, the summit with Japan and the one with China.
I wish I could say that our pressure and our action are having some effect on the current situation, but unfortunately the Afghan situation appears to remain somehow self-sufficient and resistant to all such action.
Firstly, we have the catalogue of capabilities, a 300-page document which scrupulously lists all the military capabilities that are known to be needed by our Union in order to guarantee that all of the Petersberg tasks can be fulfilled.
A new dynamic has therefore been launched on the basis of an action demonstrating political will on the part of our Member States.
Perhaps I can begin by commenting on what my honourable friend Mr Hume has just said.
As the ministers have pointed out in their excellent speeches, recent weeks have seen important developments in strengthening Europe' s contribution to its own security.
The challenge for us now is sticking to that strategy, ensuring we can make that strategy work, ensuring that, in holding out the prospect of a closer relationship with the European family, we can help those countries make the economic and political changes and reforms required in order to secure their stability and long-term prosperity.
With respect to the provision of aid, the Commission largely through its humanitarian aid office, ECHO, has made a number of specific interventions this year aimed at alleviating both the effects of the catastrophic drought in the country by supporting, through provision of funds for food security and winterisation kits, the population's displaced by the fighting in the northeast of the country.
Now it is matter of forging an effective and efficient European unit from this, under a clear and unambiguous command.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it often takes a very long time before visible results can be discerned when issues are dealt with at European level.
This means that, as MEPs, we need structures to enable us to obtain information about the decisions made and to enable us to engage in debate, to participate and to hold people to account.
The first point concerns the role of the European Parliament, which is something several other speakers have already touched on.
I can tell you that the Palestinians have great expectations of Europe.
As an association of soldiers' mothers stated, we did not take our children out of Lebanon just so that they could die for the settlements.
The Middle East conflict could therefore become the acid test of the efficiency of European Middle East policy.
Minister, I should like to say a special word of thanks to you for having been with us in committee and for being here today.
In this way other EU Member States could keep to their traditional peacekeeping activities.
It can only recover credibility if the civilian approach is its supreme guiding principle, if the instruments at its disposal are used in pursuit of effective prevention and if those instruments receive a level of funding that maintains their credibility.
This is the enemy which your CFSP has in its sights.
Secondly, NATO should be gradually winding down rather than engaging in eastward enlargement.
I cannot tell you how delighted I am to discover that Mr Brok all along was a dangerous revolutionary!
The priority now is to do all we can to strengthen the conditions for freedom and peace in Europe.
I think if we could clearly understand that, then a lot of the concerns might indeed evaporate.
We must ensure that this whole process is democratically monitored.
Like my Fine Gael colleague, Mrs Doyle, I recognise that this does not represent the creation of a European army and before shrill voices are raised in my own country, which there will be, against Irish involvement, I would point out that participation is voluntary and on a case by case basis.
All the political and diplomatic efforts, all the economic pressure, could not prevent the outbreak of violence in the heart of Europe and the unacceptable challenge that posed to all our European values.
I would also note, by the way, that the positions adopted by the Council do not, and will not, include any EU budgetary commitment to finance military action of whatever kind.
A5-0326/2000 by Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the White Paper on Commission reform (the aspects of direct relevance to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market) [COM(2000) 200 - C5-0446/2000 - 2000/2216(COS)]
That is why we want to ensure that this process is not imposed from above; we consider it crucial that all the staff are effectively associated in this whole process of modernisation.
An annual evaluation of the changes in the functioning of the Commission and of the additional cost of this reform requires consultation at the beginning of each financial year.
Moreover, it is totally illogical for the Council alone to be able to amend the Financial Regulation and we repeat our call for conciliation on this issue.
We have also been unanimous in stating that many of the shortcomings and irregularities that were condemned during the discharge for 1996 were due to the fact that previous Commissions had not managed to modernise their management and control systems and had not applied all of the legislation in force.
Evidence of this weakness can be found in the extremely limited number of refusals of approval, of authorisation, originating from the Commission.
What was very interesting from those discussions was to see how employment and organisation practices in private and public sector are actually moving closer together.
Leadership from the top will be crucial.
Lastly, it is also time to look at the Union's external representation.
We therefore ask the Commissioner: can the Commission guarantee a truly limited transitional period?
I am happy to see that the Commission' s proposal appears to be consistent with the position we are due to adopt tomorrow.
The managers of units and institutions must be given a certain amount of leeway in administration.
We can see that some ground still needs to be made up here, and we hope that the Commission will take a bolder approach to the transparency problem.
Mr President, in his letter to the Romans, the apostle Paul exhorts his readers to allow themselves to be transformed by the renewing of their minds.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the plan to reform the Commission, we are progressing towards the new European institutions: new in that changes were made to the old institutions following the problems which arose during past management and on the basis of the lengthy, exhaustive and in many places complex report of the independent experts.
As you would expect we are supporting Amendments Nos 1 to 6, submitted by the PSE.
Mr Lamassoure says on enlargement that the Commission, as regards the accession process, is expected to propose a comprehensive strategy reflecting the Union's interest in its political timetable - not just an assessment regarding the suitability of each applicant country.
With this consideration, we urge the Commission and Mr Kinnock to move ahead with their efforts at reform.
Mr President, the resignation of the Commission in the spring of 1999 was in fact the dénouement of a much more deep-seated problem within the European Commission, namely vague working structures that resulted in a lack of political accountability, fragmented policy priorities and unsatisfactory results.
This cannot be achieved by over-emphasising the word 'internal' in the reforms.
For the European Parliament, foreign affairs is a vital and interesting matter, and I completely agree that, having had a lifetime's interest myself in these issues, that is a proper explanation.
It emphasises the responsibility for those receiving reports of possible wrong-doing to act promptly, seriously and effectively.
I am sure that Parliament will give you the opportunity to go into greater depth on another occasion, since this reform is not going to end with the first vote tomorrow.
So once again transparency is the aim, and I believe we shall achieve that aim.
In those situations it is sometimes forgotten that we also operate within a democratic system and that codecision rules have to be respected - and rightly so.
The Commission maintains a division - albeit a somewhat blurred one - between political responsibility and executive competence, which past experience leads us to believe, will not work very well in practice.
(The President urged the speaker to bring her speech to a close) Mr President, I will conclude by saying that we are going to approve two amendments and another three will not be approved, as has been discussed in committee.
It was an excellent idea of Mrs Sauquillo' s to include the part on external relations in the section on internal training, thereby making it an item on the agenda.
Poverty and need are not just the product of economic backwardness and development problems but are often the result of aggression and the exploitation of the weak by the strong, of the selfishness of the capable in the face of the weakness of the marginalised.
Finally, we should understand that Mr Patten' s proposal for aid responsible to a board of Commissioner directors with Mr Nielson as Chief Executive is an unworkable gimmick borrowed from management text books and is fundamentally incompatible with the collegiate structure of the Commission itself.
Our Committee shared the view of the rapporteur that the Commissioner for Development should both formulate and implement policy in this area, although these should be coordinated with the other policies dealing with external activities.
Here again the understanding of the budget authority has played a crucial role for funding this major reorganisation of the European External Service.
(The sitting was closed at 12.30 a.m.)
I am told, especially in France, that stringent national measures must be adopted to protect French coasts: it has also been proposed that French coastguards should be deployed.
Madam President, I believe it is beyond doubt that the Commission, like the French Presidency considers the question of maritime safety and environmental protection to be of extreme importance.
I wish to conclude by thanking Mr Gayssot, President of the Transport Council of Ministers, for his encouraging comments.
We all agree on that, but we have to find the methodology by which that particular priority can be implemented, and we have yet to secure an agreement between the three institutions on that.
There are numerous points, as Mr Watts has already explained, where the European Parliament takes a firmer stand than the Council appears to be taking.
There have also been talks with the sectors concerned and a great deal of contact with the French Presidency with the aim of being able to arrive at a text agreed by consensus that can be adopted quickly by the two legislative bodies: the Council and the European Parliament.
Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources, the practice of direct dumping with little thought for the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable.
Furthermore, the public have a right to know what preparations have been made, what types of material are threatening and what impacts are to be expected.
I am convinced that this will mean, in the longer term, the establishment of a European coastguard.
I will support this report and the Commission' s amendments, but I call on the Members of Parliament to also support the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on social standards.
What is less satisfactory, as has just been pointed out, is our past record; heaven knows that the States of the European Union have scarcely covered themselves in glory in the realm of maritime safety.
Please help to ensure that the Commission sends a clear signal here.
Everyone who works in the sector bears a heavy responsibility.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the disasters of the past few months have brought to light the inadequacies of legislation, weaknesses in the systems of control and deficiencies in terms of human and financial resources.
A few weeks ago, the west of France was struck by another ecological disaster, the wreck of the chemical tanker, the Ievoli Sun, and it is only today that the European Parliament will take the decision to strengthen maritime safety.
As the rapporteur very rightly points out, the condition of a tanker is more indicative than its age.
Mr President, I am only going to comment on and explain the majority position of the Socialist Group on one of the proposals, the one that modifies the directive regulating inspection organisations.
We do not want them in our ports or in our waters.
I would just like to concentrate on two dossiers: port state control and the phasing out of single-hull oil tankers.
If we want to be credible, we must act quickly and put an end to sterile political diatribes.
We all know each other's positions by now, which is another reason why we need to vote today.
There is, however, still much to be done to improve safety at sea.
Justice can be merciless towards the poor who are unable to pay a tax or a fine, and will even go so far as to seize their meagre belongings.
I therefore consider that there is an incredible amount still to do in this area.
So it is important to state the political and cultural bottom line: it is time to get rid of the emergency culture, and it is time to affirm the prevention culture.
The problem of safety for this form of transport requires offenders to be penalised rigorously; imposing such penalties entails costs that must be shared by the whole sector worldwide, so that we do not penalise the European sector even more.
When we do this we should always remember that double hulls or even triple hulls do not guarantee with absolute certainty that accidents will not happen in the future.
I want to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise.
Madam President, I first would like to thank you all for this interesting and valuable debate.
Amendments Nos 1, 6, 7 and 8 also relate to the refusal of access.
In order to achieve the main objective of this proposal, namely to phase out old single-hull oil tankers quickly, we are prepared to go along with the deletion of the proposed financial incentive system setting up differential charging of port and pilotage dues.
Member States must satisfy themselves that the classification society they have chosen to work on their behalf, fulfils the tasks to their full satisfaction.
That leaves Amendment No 10 dealing with the important issue of liability limits.
Let me conclude by recalling that one month ago the Ievoli Sun sank near Cherbourg with 6 000 tonnes of dangerous cargo.
" You can understand that there might be an incompetent and provocative official, but when 15 countries give their assent to this kind of answer, Madam President, I think you should take the initiative when you meet the Council to have this prerogative of Members of Parliament respected.
Report (A5-0344/2000) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design standards for single-hull oil tankers [COM(2000) 142 - C5­0173/2000 - 2000/0067(COD)]
Relating to Amendment No 2:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Employment creation must remain one of our top priorities.
At the same time, big shipowners ply their trade uncontrolled under flags of convenience and the state of world shipping goes from bad to worse.
The Commission proposal looks reassuring, but is not proof against deliberate sabotage.
To do so, we must be sure that the measures we are proposing today are implemented by all the Member States of the European Union.
The Commission is right to want to stop Europe lagging behind America.
Many technical experts have pointed out the difficulties encountered when inspecting the space between the two hulls and during its maintenance.
This decision is important but it does not go far enough.
In addition, I have voted for all the amendments that improve and tighten up the Commission' s proposals.
The revision of Directive 94/57/EC is becoming a matter of some urgency, especially since Malta and Cyprus, the fourth and sixth largest fleets worldwide respectively, are candidates for accession to the European Union.
Ships save on port fees by continuing to sail through stormy weather and by risking fatal accidents at other times too.
Maritime safety must not simply be an issue arising out of a state of urgency in the wake of each new disaster that hits our shorelines, but the object of an internationally integrated and constant policy.
It is of little consequence to us whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights is incorporated into the Treaty on European Union or not, because, in any case, this Charter, allegedly a Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only refuses to include the elementary rights of workers, it actually clears the way for retrograde social measures.
I believe that is a crucial criterion by which to judge the Treaty of Nice.
. (FR) On the eve of the Nice Summit and without prejudging the outcome, I want to salute the tremendous work carried out by the French Presidency and the majority of ministers who generously put in the time and effort to address Parliament on a regular basis both in committee and in parliament.
. (PT) The debate and the resolution adopted by Parliament give serious cause for concern as to what will be decided at the Nice Summit, specifically as regards the potential increase in restrictions on the sovereignty of small countries such as Portugal, the strengthening of federalism and the militaristic path in security and defence policy, and the weak and clearly inadequate measures in the social sphere.
In order for Treaty reform, and indeed enlargement, to be a success it must have the full support of the people.
The reforms proposed by Malcolm Harbour MEP on the White Paper are common sense reforms.
The voters I represent have no sympathy with any of its policy directions.
It is becoming ever more apparent that opening the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in the European Parliament), one might go so far as to say on the balance of power between the Member States, has opened a Pandora' s box which will be very difficult to close in Nice.
So if you succeed in avoiding wars, as you have done so far, you will be doing the most important thing that has ever been done in the world.'
. (FR) The 'Other Europe' delegation of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group resolutely voted against the own-initiative report which was drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and presented by Mr Brok.
I have a nephew, my sister' s son, who has been at the NATO bases in the United States learning to fly fighter planes, and he has been promoted, so he is ready to be an air-force pilot.
It is up to each individual Member State to decide to what extent it wants to participate in a common European security and defence policy.
We are convinced that a Europe of Peace will not be created through military alliances.
We do not need euro-militarism.
. (SV) I value the attempt to develop a common European security policy, but I am against the development of a common military defence force.
We do not consider that an arms build-up, with the resultant increased military expenditure, is the answer to the challenges faced by Europe in 2001 and beyond.
We have 19 recitals and 23 numbered paragraphs with 36 subparagraphs.
But the language of the document goes even further.
Problems taken up in the report can be solved with a humane asylum and refugee policy, by organising work to take into consideration a balance between work and personal life as well as by taking responsibility for people with special needs in a way which shows solidarity and social responsibility.
The rapporteur feels that a legal framework is required at European level that makes it possible for persons providing domestic services to be covered by employment protection legislation.
She wants this type of work to be recognised as an occupation in its own right and is calling for European rules to be established on the rights of these workers - at present the situation varies from country to country.
Guy-Quint report (A5-0327/2000)
By the same token, nepotism and lack of transparency must be eradicated from the Commission services, especially as regards recruitment for temporary posts.
It is therefore necessary to ensure that these commitments are respected much more closely than they have been in the past.
I have voted in favour of the Lamassoure report, which concerns itself most of all with the institutional aspects of Commission reform.
I regret this and that is why we abstained from the vote as a group, because we feel that the NGOs have done badly out of it.
Secondly, Madam President, I would like to ask you to explain to the House as clearly as possible, given the amount of contradictory information which has accumulated throughout the day, what the structure of the debate with the French Presidency will be in relation to the Nice European Council, and what approach will be taken to the participation of the President-in-Office of the Council.
Do you not want there to be a resolution?
Madam President, no one underestimates the significance and scope of this summit, which has also been the lengthiest in the history of the European Union.
Madam President, there has been mention of what the task of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs may be.
Thank you, Mr Hänsch, for that constructive contribution.
Madam President, in view of that decision and since Commissioner Liikanen will not be present on Thursday but could be present on Wednesday, I wonder whether it would be possible to bring Mrs Gill's report on European digital content forward from Thursday to Wednesday to fill that slot.
Madam President, on 20 October, 200 political prisoners went on hunger strike, which they intend to see through to the bitter end, in protest against the Turkish Government's policy of using 'white' isolation cells in order to undermine morale and break down prisoners' resistance.
Madam President, we are now discussing this directive for the second time this year, and once again, a large number of amendments have been tabled.
Despite this clear course of action, we must also be conscious of the fact that we are the Parliament of a Union that sets great store by the principles of the constitutional State, which means that we must recognise the limitations of our authority, i.e. we must know what the limits are to the authority we derive from Article 95, the legal basis we are invoking for the new tobacco directive.
To uphold this basic principle, we have, to begin with, proposed extending the legal basis to include Article 133 of the Treaty, but above all, we have postponed the date by which Member States will be obliged to implement it to 1 January 2007.
Let us be absolutely sure that they are informed when they make the decision one way or the other.
We are of the opinion, however, that there are very significant differences between the issue of tobacco advertising and this directive.
The fact is that the Court of Justice has just repealed the 1998 Directive banning advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products.
However, I think the Council' s proposal with regard to the size of the warnings on labels besides those on cigarette packets, is an improvement on Amendment No 25, since the 50 cm² limit is far too close to the surface area of a packet of cigarettes.
This is my concern on this issue.
Therefore, their correct legal basis is the former Article 100a or the current Article 95.
What is more, I feel this will set a poor example if we want to put warnings on other products at a later stage.
Mr President, it is fair to say that we have a moral obligation to fully inform the 30 million consumers of the European Union about the public health dangers of cigarettes.
So, instead of exporting cigarettes we will be exporting jobs - 4 000 of them in my region alone.
Mr President, to begin with I would like to congratulate Mr Maaten on a splendid report.
Mr President, smoking is the tragedy of our time - the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the European Union.
If you enlist Article 133 for the export ban then the conclusion is obvious that it is not part of a common commercial policy to dictate to third countries what they should import.
There should be no exemption for trademarks or we will simply create new anomalies in competition and the single market.
I am hoping the Commissioner might reassure us that an increase in the level of staff support within the Commission is on the cards.
Mr Bowis asked whether the exemption would apply.
They went on to say in Paragraph 117 of the judgment: "As has been observed in Paragraphs 98 and 111 of this judgment, a directive prohibiting certain forms of advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products could have been adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty.
The Commission would prefer to examine the available data and report back in due course.
The Commission reports on the application of the excise directives address this problem in the proper way.
As the rapporteur, I would recommend that these amendments be supported as they make a lot of sense.
The extra hour of daylight provided by moving to summer time is particularly beneficial in the tourism and leisure sector, where increases in business directly linked to lighter and longer evenings have been recorded.
I have said this because I and my group are convinced that Europe has more serious problems and tasks to deal with.
The amendments which have been tabled by Parliament and the rapporteur are therefore, in my opinion, unhelpful, because they tend to create uncertainty rather than increase confidence.
For example, the transport sector in particular, but also other sectors of industry, requires stable, long-term planning on account of technical requirements connected with the preparation of transport timetables.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0349/2000) on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use [8878/1/2000 - C5-0424/2000 - 1997/0197(COD)] (rapporteur: Mr Liese)
As far as the direct benefit is concerned, investigators running clinical trials have to identify those cases where it is necessary to administer medical products and carry out the accompanying examinations in order to draw conclusions for future patients.
Finally, adults incapable of giving consent should only participate in trials that relate to the condition affecting them and causing their incapacity.
One more word, on another point I consider highly important, I mean Amendment No 30 which concerns non-commercial clinical trials.
That is why medical science should be given every possible means of properly protecting individual and public health.
The debate is closed.
We must not forget that the essence of the acquis communautaire from these programmes needs to be passed on to the new health programmes currently being drawn up and it is therefore only right that we extend them.
I agree with Mr Trakatellis: you cannot play games with patients' health when they expect our help, or with non-governmental organisations which need these Community budgets to deliver the health policies on the ground.
The prevention of drug dependence programmes must also be focused not only on black spots, but across many other areas within the European Union.
To summarise, Madam President, I must say the developments in the public health sector in the European Union go too far for my liking.
Standing of victims in criminal procedure
I would like to highlight that, despite its importance and the fact that it is a mandatory point of reference in Europe, the Convention has still not been ratified, as of 18 September 2000, by the following Member States of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.
The second aspect which played a certain part was the issue of evidence recorded on video.
It may be that we have devoted too little time to the victims, who are often the weakest members of society.
Finally, this vote is important because Parliament has the opportunity to make significant improvements to the legislative proposal, precisely those suggested in Mrs Cerdeira Morterero' s excellent report and supported by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
In addition, it has been ascertained that when victims report crimes they are subjected to discriminatory behaviour.
The guilty party, Arturo Lojacono, was identified and sentenced, but sought refuge abroad.
It can be difficult for a foreign victim to follow the criminal procedures from a distance, and in this case it is clear that special measures are required.
It was the subject of difficult discussions in the Council.
The Commission wishes to continue the feasibility study for such a project.
Mr Posselt, we will pass on your arguments to the College of Quaestors so that they can adopt the resolution that they think best and so that it will be known to all Members.
The Commission therefore supports the Council's request for urgent procedure and calls on the members of the European Parliament to support this urgent procedure.
The chairman of the Committee on Budgets tells me that this is the very first time that agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament at conciliation.
The Commission has submitted its analysis of outstanding commitments and its strategy for eliminating abnormal outstanding commitments.
We can finance cooperation with the Baltic region and our crisis reaction forces and we have given MEDA EUR 40 million more than the Council provided.
Having been allocated so little time, which is a pity because the budget - and the rapporteurs - deserve more than a derisory two and a half minutes, I must confine myself to just a few comments.
Mr President, when a delegation from this Parliament was visiting the People' s Republic of China some time ago, we were in Xiamen, in the south-east of China, and there was an island visible on the horizon.
Indeed, the representatives of the three institutions spared no effort to conclude an overall agreement on the 2001 budget and I wish to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the Council, both the members of the parliamentary delegation and Mrs Schreyer.
I am delighted that our institutions have been able to reach agreement on adopting, at only one reading, all aspects of this Letter of Amendment No 2, which concerns not only agricultural expenditure but also the fisheries agreements and the inclusion of an estimated balance for the 2000 financial year in the preliminary draft budget for 2001.
Personally, I consider this to be extremely important.
To conclude this overview, I wish to join those who have highlighted the excellent climate in which this budgetary procedure has taken place.
In providing the EUR 200 million emergency package, the Union has also proven that it is perfectly able to act quickly and take full account of its foreign policy responsibilities.
Mr President, I should like to answer Mr Colom i Naval on the issue of the use of the flexibility instrument in revising the financial perspective.
We praised Commissioner Busquin, who has exceeded our expectations in that area.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like first of all to say that the European Parliament has scored a major victory in as much as the cuts in the Latin American, Asian and African poverty programmes have been made good.
In particular I would cite Euronews so that people can see in the media what Parliament and the Union are doing.
We have a budget which is under 1.06%, we have a budget, Mr Colom, which is within the financial perspective.
I should also like to thank Mrs Schreyer, who has continued to help us with her highly constructive approach and, of course, my friend Jutta Haug, who has done an excellent job, not forgetting Joan Colom i Naval and Markus Ferber.
You keep saying that the financial perspective is sacrosanct as far as you are concerned.
Our group will also vote in favour of this budget because it shows that, once again, we have reached an exemplary compromise, despite being under increasing pressure.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to welcome Mr Jacques Chirac, President of France and President-in-Office of the Council,
We must also pay tribute to the European spirit, which finally enabled us to leave Nice having resolved those issues left over from Amsterdam and having paved the way for the future.
I now come to one of the most positive outcomes of the IGC.
After all, enlargement is clearly the major issue facing Europe today.
Its significance will be assessed in the future and I wish to pay tribute to your Parliament which contributed so greatly to its drafting.
A year ago, the Erika ran aground off the French coast and despite the amazing mobilisation of charities and the authorities, the coast is still suffering the consequences of this shipwreck.
First of all, at Nice we concluded the round of negotiations begun at the Cologne and Helsinki European Councils.
We can welcome the fact that the Union was able to announce that it would be dedicating some EUR 13 billion to the process over a period of seven years, including, of course, the loans from the European Investment Bank.
The Commission's proposals on maritime safety and the creation of a European Food Safety Authority met with strong support, as did the decisions on our seven outermost regions.
Lastly, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that gave rise to the most difficult debate and the most difficult decision.
Unfortunately, we also witnessed the contrast between large and small countries over recent months - and this too should never be repeated, because it acts as an insidious poison in the European Union - with many large countries behaving most meanly and many small countries behaving most generously.
This is a step backwards that applies to all areas of Community life, and I predict, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that our fellow citizens - and I am afraid also the Members of Parliament and the Heads of Government - are going to have to go back to school for lessons in arithmetic.
I can say that there are parts we like and much about which we are concerned.
(Applause)
The obstacles between the Fifteen that multiplied during the Summit are symptomatic.
The Member States do not have the support of the people because there is no such thing as a European people and they are therefore forced by public opinion to advocate their national interests with increasing fervour, even if this means changing the maximum number of Members of the European Parliament set by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is already out of date, and even if this means increasing the number of European Commissioners to 27, even though the current Commission of Fifteen does not work.
Into what situation will all these people have dragged France when the European bubble bursts and the French have nothing in their mouths but the bitter taste of having been conned once again by their mediocre and self-serving leaders?
On the contrary, their restraint was driven by serious problems and concerns and the result of informed national opinion, which cannot be swept to one side and must be taken seriously.
The Presidency regrets these shortcomings and itself had reservations and made a considerable effort to ensure that France made progress in areas about which it is particularly sensitive.
Hence these proposed amendments, these so-called compromise amendments from three groups.
It was really necessary to simplify the plethora of legal and administrative arrangements applying to clinical trials in the Member States.
In fact, I feel that it is right for all the States of the European Union to be on the same summer time" .
That brings us to the explanations of vote on the Cerdeira Morterero report.
Appropriate measures should be taken to provide crime victims with the following rights: to provide and receive information; communications facilities; participation in the procedure and access to free legal aid; a suitable level of protection and privacy; the possibility to seek compensation under criminal procedure and to dispute settlement through mediation.
European Council/ French Presidency (continuation)
That explains why many of us found Nice heartbreaking.
The Heads of State and Government have just recognised at Nice what we were saying after Amsterdam: the Intergovernmental Conference method is no longer successful for Europe.
As representative of the parties united in the European Free Alliance, I would like to alert the Commission, but particularly the Council, to the dangers, should the EU wish to be no more than an intergovernmental association.
Mr President, the fairly unanimous message from the President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission and heads of government is basically that the Treaty of Nice secures the framework for the unification of Europe.
In other words, the democratic deficit is now even greater.
We must reflect seriously on what has happened.
In reality, it is the President who is being unrealistic if he thinks that it will be possible to enlarge the Union with such a Treaty.
Mr President, Nice was, and should have been, a historic date, the kick-off for the new Europe, the Europe of the new century, the great Europe, the Europe of all the Europeans.
Enlargement has given you, has given us all the same task as Monnet and Schuman had fifty years ago: the task of developing a method, structure and vision for the future of Europe.
There is just one small satisfaction: enlargement.
Four main problems loom large.
This clause adopts the European Parliament's opinion that further development of the European Union will be impossible using the intergovernmental method applied in the past.
Like the President of the Republic this morning, I too try to imagine what would happen if we had arrived here without a Treaty of Nice.
We have tried to work on a principle of simple reweighting in this squaring of the circle, and I think that on the whole the result is balanced.
Later we will see, together, all together, how to proceed.
We must lift the consensus rule, including in a future convention.
In all those cases we reached the conclusion that those treaties were not entirely satisfactory, did not respond to all of our aspirations, but nonetheless represented a step forward and were at least better than the status quo.
Many people looking at the Treaty of Nice will wonder why it was done in that way.
But the European Council in Nice, like many other summits in the history of the European Union, represents a triumph for reality, a triumph of pragmatism over utopianism.
We would have been able to convey a better, stronger European result to the people with a better and clearer conscience.
This summit would have been a triumph if the crucial revision of the Treaties had been crowned with as much success as the areas I have just mentioned.
And it is more democratic to boot.
Mr Blair returned to Great Britain as a conquering hero because he had not surrendered this, had not surrendered that and had fought for Britain's interests.
We have been quite frank with each other in today's debate about those parts of the Treaty of Nice which give us cause for satisfaction and even more open about those with which we are not content. Our reasons are different in some cases but we share the same feelings and concerns.
A fine signal to send our close partners in the South.
It is true that the Chamber is pretty thin, but unfortunately the debate on the budget lasted longer than planned and we - I and the speakers who follow me - will not have the opportunity to raise the matter with the Presidency.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the principles of thrift and social and economic balance have been taken into account in drawing up the budget and the rapporteur must be thanked for that.
Let us not kid ourselves, this is a good budget.
What we are talking about is an early-retirement scheme which as yet has no legal base; no one knows whether what will be proposed is compulsory or non-compulsory and it is, after all, a p.m. that is on the line.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, representative of the Council, rapporteurs, each budgetary year the European Parliament gains budgetary importance.
And I am going a little further, because it is not enough to have strict and transparent rules for implementing the budget, such as the cancellation of commitments if they have not been implemented after two years.
We all know that.
We are being up front with our praise and you may be sure that we shall seek to exercise strict control in the future.
Here are your measures which quite explicitly promote environmental protection.
Mr President, our relations with Russia underwent a fundamental change when the cold war ended.
However, I am of the opinion that the importance of Russia is not really reflected in the budget, but we disagree with the Social Democrats on that score.
Now I am in favour of encouraging Russia and the Ukraine to move in our direction and cooperate with other alliance countries in crisis-management tasks, but I would not be in favour of us moving in their direction or adjusting our policies in order to accommodate them.
Unless the Russian Federation rectifies this situation by creating, post haste, the necessary legal and security framework and hence a more friendly investment climate, there would appear to be no way out of the economic crisis, high oil prices notwithstanding.
That means that we have a joint responsibility for peace in the Caucasus, for environmental protection in the Russian Federation and for the rights of its indigenous people.
I think that the solution cannot be military, as the situation clearly demonstrates, and that it can only be political.
The famous Russian opposition politician, Grigori Jawlinski, has made it into western newspaper columns again lately.
Negotiations to find creative solutions as regards the future freedom of transit for the people of Kaliningrad through Lithuania and Poland should also be completed before Poland and Lithuania accede to the EU.
It is not just because each of the major European powers is primarily concerned with safeguarding the interests of its own capitalist groups, but in the final analysis, what does capitalist Europe have to offer Russia?
The twin-track strategy proposed by Mr Oostlander offers a way out, for which I thank him.
His report has been welcomed by all parts of Parliament except, perhaps by those who look back with nostalgia to the not-so-golden days memorialised by a very large number of brave Soviet dissidents.
I am anxious to work closely with the incoming Swedish presidency to make concrete progress on the Northern Dimension.
It is because we take our relationship with Russia so seriously that these issues matter.
Subject: Genetically modified organisms and crops Since the Spring of this year there have been many cases of the release into the environment in various EU countries of genetically modified organisms and crops, namely cotton, oil seed rape and maize.
This common position sets much more stringent requirements for the Member States.
It would be both unwise and foolish for the Council to attempt to do so.
Secondly: has the Council obtained information from the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, who is well represented locally?
The President-in-Office must know if he met Mr Maskhadov or not.
What improvements does the Council intend to make to the basic directive, 92/12/EEC, to ensure that the shipper' s and recipient' s responsibilities are precisely apportioned, precluding any possibility of fraud?
This report shows, as you quite rightly state, that tax fraud within the Community has reached worrying levels.
I should like to draw the honourable Member' s attention to the fact that recital 3 of the draft directive does indeed stipulate that application thereof shall not be prejudicial to the commitments arising under the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967.
The proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) 2820/98 so as to extend duty-free access without any quantitative restrictions to products originating in the least-developed countries, which the Commission put forward recently, is the result of Community initiatives to improve market access for the least developed countries.
I should just like to make you see, on this, my last visit here, what the point of this exercise actually is.
Finally, non-tested animals aged above thirty months may no longer enter the food chain.
As you yourself stated, these are bold decisions of recent date, the latest of these being from 4 December, that is a week ago.
This party, which aims to reconcile Islam and the modern world and which could make a significant contribution towards reviving the country's ailing democracy and, therefore, strengthening the rule of law, finds itself subjected to a ban on the well-worn pretext that it would represent 'a threat to State security'.
Subject: UN special session on children The UN General Assembly's Special Session on Children, in September 2001, will discuss the situation of children world-wide, and consider adopting a new plan of action to make children's rights a reality across the world.
Question No 11 by (H-0894/00):
The Loïzidou case has already given rise to two judgements against Turkey.
This occurs particularly in Longuenesse jail in France and applies to truck drivers from the United Kingdom and other countries.
In accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on European Union, the Council shall adopt this decision unanimously, as is the case, moreover, for any other decision with implications in the area of defence.
Question No 22 by (H-0918/00):
As you know, it was not possible, unfortunately, to make any progress in this area at Nice.
With the changes and democratic developments in Yugoslavia, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the European Union and the present motion for a resolution on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, there are good prospects for democratisation and stabilisation in the Western Balkans and Croatia can play a specific and decisive role here.
Another point in Croatia's favour is the changed attitude of the newly elected Croatian authorities to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
Let me also stress that Croatia is endeavouring to put its relations with neighbouring states in good order.
Unlike its neighbour Slovenia, immediately after independence in 1991 Croatia was not able to develop in a way as to allow it to become a candidate for accession at this point.
Mr President, I am delighted to be able to comment on the excellent report by the honourable gentleman, Mr Baltas - produced, as several honourable gentlemen have said, with considerable expedition - on the Commission's feasibility study for a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia.
Last month, as the House knows, Croatia hosted, with extremely impressive efficiency and diplomatic finesse, the historic Zagreb Summit.
We welcome Parliament's support so far, not least on the important question of the legal base for the stabilisation and association agreements.
The road to democracy, to respect for human rights, to a sound administrative and legal system, to the eradication of corruption, seems to be a long road beset with obstacles.
Last week, hundreds of students were picked up and four of them were returned to their parents as corpses.
The EU embassy in Jakarta could assume a coordinating role.
Mr President, the positive developments that have been seen in Indonesia are unquestionable, to the extent that they suggest that a new relationship and effective cooperation with that country are in order.
More than one hundred thousand refugees remain in West Timor, virtual human shields for the originators and perpetrators of crimes in East Timor.
In many places, violence prevails over dialogue.
The international community must bring maximum pressure to bear on Jakarta in order to put an end to the violence on the Moluccas.
I believe Indonesia is a great country, but it is at a crossroads, and it depends on the efforts of the international community and the European Union whether, at this crossroads, it will swing for good towards democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, or whether the disorder will increase.
The position we have to take regarding the territorial integrity of Indonesia is simple: we have to abide by international law and by the United Nations Resolution 2504 of December 1969.
Mr President, I welcome this report but I feel it is a little up-beat.
A special case is the still unresolved question of West Timor.
The support we are currently giving to the office of the attorney-general in Jakarta is intended to help him in his attempts to combat corruption.
The enlargement of the Community and the introduction of the euro could bring further risks with them.
I thank the Commission for its efforts and its work ...
I am sure, Commissioner, that once this first step is taken, the discussion about the European Public Prosecutor's Office will no longer seem like a religious war between those for and those against, which has blocked all progress so far.
Despite our having every possible sympathy for the rapporteur, Mrs Theato, and for her sterling efforts, we are opposed to establishing an independent European prosecution authority because it is a staging post towards the federal Europe we oppose.
Mr President, it is always a pleasure following Mr Dell'Alba, because he makes a British Euro-sceptic sound very sensible in this place.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Theato on her report and in particular for making the effort to come here as I know she is not feeling very well tonight.
The strategy is built around four main lines of action: an anti-fraud legislative policy, operational cooperation between the relevant authorities, an interinstitutional approach to combat fraud in office and enhancement of the penal judicial dimension.
The next target date is 2004, the next Intergovernmental Conference.
This has happened on several occasions in relation to the structural funds, for example.
It is imperative also that we stick to the remit required of us and that we concentrate exclusively during the discharge process on the year in question.
One day we will have to change this sort of absence of the 'innocent hand' of the Council, which is never guilty of anything.
The Court of Auditors supplies reports and one of the most important recipients of these reports is Parliament.
In colloquial terms, what this report is saying is that in future the Committee on Budgetary Control will be more watchful and will want to hear names named when it comes to the unknown whereabouts of European tax monies.
I heard - and it is not an isolated incident - the United Kingdom Minister for Social Welfare say on television that if he could stop fraud he could save GBP 6 billion.
After the events of the past year, your aim is to create a budgetary control and discharge procedure which is more transparent and above all more efficient and effective.
That too would have to be taken into account.
In my view, the common position before us, which we have to decide on today, has a number of crucial weaknesses, which for the rest nobody has disputed so far during the debate in terms of principle.
If it takes three pages to do so, then clearly there will be enough points of reference and opportunities for dispute and we will create no legal certainty.
The European single market is a pan-European market place but within which the market in shares must be treated like other markets so that national boundaries, even if they delineate different jurisdictions, do not interfere with the essential equivalence of the rules across the market place.
In the second block are a series of amendments that aim to improve the participation of workers when there is a takeover bid.
The proposals introduce three key elements at a time when there is a change in control of a company: protection of minority shareholders, transparency in relation to bid information and regulatory supervision of the process.
This is a matter on which clarity is of the utmost importance.
Greater understanding must be shown for national characteristics. Otherwise, there may be devastating consequences for an individual Member State' s company structure.
Mr Bolkestein himself has said that it is crucial that the management of target companies consult shareholders in this case.
Mr President, it is interesting to follow Mr Martin as an English speaker and I can assure him that things are certainly not falling apart in the British economy even though my party would like a change of government.
This amendment seeks to introduce an instrument enabling a majority shareholder to take over the remaining securities.
The situation in the United States can teach us a thing or two on that score, and should be a warning to us to proceed more cautiously.
I owe special thanks to Mr Dehousse and Mr Echerer, whose many discussions helped bring about workable compromises.
The reservations voiced in several quarters can be summarised in two major groups.
Mr President, to repeat a felicitous expression used by GESAC (the European Association of Authors' and Composers' Societies), the draft under discussion was subjected to unjustified attacks during its review by the Council.
I will have a hard job persuading the people in my country, but I am firmly convinced that the harmonisation of the right of resale, on the basis of the EP's proposals, will bring benefits to all concerned.
That has nothing to do with special national interests but contributes to an open and transparent political debate.
With one item there would have been considerable difficulty in tracing the artist's family; only tracing agents and collecting societies would have benefited.
The second important issue is that of the total amount, which is removed in Amendment No 7.
I have duly noted the fact.
I think that this important matter, close to the committee' s heart, ought to be debated today.
What has surprised me slightly as rapporteur over the past few months is that we have somewhat lost sight of these three things.
Without jeopardising the modernisation of all postal services and the opening to competition, Member States must continue to preserve their rural network of counter services, which help bring the remote places closer to centres of decision making and are thus indispensable to the social cohesion of the smallest urban or rural communities.
There is no reason why the service offered to people should not incorporate all kinds of technical and economic progress, and I believe that, from this point of view, doing away with special services is a step for which no clarification had first been provided.
Madam President, Commissioner, may I begin by reiterating my thanks to my honourable colleague Markus Ferber on behalf of our group, because he sought compromises within the committee and he found them.
What it came up with was, in the words of Neil Armstrong, the famous American astronaut: "one giant leap for mankind" in that they moved from 350 grammes to 50 grammes in one fell swoop.
I am sorry, Mr Ferber, I am concerned about job losses and the effect they will have.
Some of my colleagues do not share my opinion on a number of scores, as will become evident in due course.
It would be more in keeping with citizens' expectations to restore the balance where public services are concerned by making any new extension to the commercial sphere conditional upon respect for the fundamental objective of the sustainable development of European society.
Private operators will also be able to deliver letters at four times the price of a normal letter.
In fact, it provides for minimal subsequent opening-up of the market and provides absolutely no certainty regarding future steps while, as far as the universal service is concerned, the Swedish example should reassure all those who feel that privatisation will mean the end of the postal services.
If the step which the European Parliament now wants to take is far too small, let us then at least ensure that we pick up the thread in a couple of years' time.
Let me say this to Georg and Markus: when the postman calls once, or even twice, we are well aware that this is not the ultimate social service in Europe.
In the capacity of rapporteur of the general interest services for our committee, there is no doubt that we will need to cast a critical eye over these developments.
According to my Spanish colleagues - and I would like to check this out with the Commissioner - Spain has transposed the 1997 Directive in its entirety, others have not done anything, and those who have not done anything would now like to take huge steps to make up the difference.
For example, in the present case, a country with a much lower than average ratio will obviously not have any problems, while a country with a much higher ratio will despair if it has to liberalise cross-border postal services as Mr Bolkestein proposes.
We in this House must give the postal market a chance.
Madam President, the public monopoly for postal services was introduced in the nineteenth century for a very good reason.
The Commission's proposal to liberalise the postal services has been discussed intensively across the length and breadth of my constituency from Malin Head to Connemara and from the outskirts of Dublin to the islands.
From the Spanish experience, which has been mentioned a few times, I believe that Parliament' s amendments improve on the Commission' s proposal because it introduces moderation - strict moderation - into the pace of opening up and liberalisation.
Madam President, Arlette Laguiller and I reject any way in which private capital might be introduced into postal services.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is as if we are debating the procession of Echternach today: two steps forward, one step back with the little progress we are making on one of the key political dossiers for completing the internal market, namely the liberalisation of the postal services.
That is why I have re-tabled some of the amendments which we discussed in committee and which we will be voting for - especially in relation to the liberalisation of direct mail.
It will be a triple blow to Britain and a triple blow in particular to rural Britain: an end to the daily delivery and collection; an end to the uniform price - people in rural areas will pay more for their post; and third and finally, an end to our extensive and excellent network of rural sub-post offices.
It is indeed a balanced compromise and I hope that it will be accepted by the Council.
In the same way, the great flights of rhetoric, here in this debate, on the need to build the new Europe do little to conceal the faint-heartedness and conservatism that exist.
Look where we are now, more than ten years later.
If we do too little, too late, the postal sector as a whole will be in danger.
Our proposal strikes a careful balance, because universal service providers will need time to change the structures further, to become more flexible enterprises so they can adapt to new market conditions.
In this spirit, I can accept those of your amendments which are non-contentious and others which rightly give emphasis to issues such as universal service as applied in Member States, redressing complaints, and the rural network.
Secondly, this whole matter will be discussed at a Telecom Council next Friday.
We tried to arrive at a conciliation with the Commission, but this did not really come about.
There has been liaison with the Commission, and it was clear from the last meeting that the Commission was maintaining its position, i.e. a quota system administered according to the 'first come, first served' method and a transition to a 'tariff only' system in 2006.
This proposal has already been accepted by Ecuador, the world' s leading banana producer and one of the parties which has complained to the World Trade Organisation.
I believe that the amendment tabled at the last minute by Mr Vatanen does nothing to help this issue, and I would ask him, if he is listening, to consider the possibility of withdrawing it.
In this regard, I would like to remind you that banana production is not alien to the Community.
The WTO is a set of rules.
We shall most probably be in a more powerful position then, and this should be reflected in the banana report and in the objectives we lay down.
Each group of countries has been able to develop its production because we were offering them a market which we ought not now to take away from them.
I conclude by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Dary, on the excellent job he has done.
I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for his desire his reach a compromise solution with the Commission.
This is deeply unfair.
Welcome
Mr President, may I express my thanks for the strong support I have received from all the groups.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended) (The sitting was suspended at 12 noon for a formal sitting and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)
The Commission is prepared, on the other hand, to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
This has also met with the approval of the person who tabled the amendment.
Report (A5-0376/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission communication "Protection of the Communities' financial interests - The fight against fraud - For an overall strategic approach" [COM(2000) 358 - C5-0578/2000 - 2000/2279(COS)]
. (EL) Unfortunately, although the Commission accepted many of the European Parliament's amendments, the Council did not.
Under cover of legal arguments, a number of MEPs have actually been defending the tobacco industry.
We have no right to dictate to others what they do in their countries outside the EU, nor is it wise to export jobs from the EU to third countries where they will simply produce and sell the products and take over our existing markets.
As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco, and 85% of lung cancers are caused by smoking.
Mr President, I voted for the Trakatellis report which, as we know, allocates EUR 79.1 million for 2001-2002, including EUR 8.5 million to health information, EUR 31.1 million to the plan of action on cancer, EUR 22.2 million to the prevention of AIDS, EUR 11.4 million to the prevention of drug dependence, EUR 4.4 million to health monitoring and EUR 1.3 million to the fight against pollution-related diseases.
Mr President, I voted for the directive on takeover bids.
It cannot, therefore, be the objective of this Parliament to undermine the European art market and in conciliation I hope now that the Member States and Commission will be able to maintain the common position.
For these reasons, the Members representing the Freedom Alliance have decided not to endorse the report.
Also, both the young and the renowned artist will suffer if the international trade moves outside the European borders due to European over-regulation.
In general, the financial resources allocated to the stabilisation of this area are widely known to be insufficient.
The situation is alarming.
The fraudsters will seek out those countries that have the least protection.
Corpus Juris envisages the eventual creation of an independent European Prosecution Office with jurisdiction for offences against the EU's financial interests carried out both by members and officials of EU institutions and by third parties.
If, in that process, I can safeguard the interests of our ACP countries then that is all to the good, but I believe that it is important that we safeguard and look to the welfare of European citizens.
Mr Dary' s report shows due concern both for the banana producers in the Community and the ACP countries.
I can also accept Amendment No 28, if a corresponding clause is added about the possibility of reducing the tariff.
In the view of the Commission, the ten-year period to which Amendments Nos 11 and 13 refer would be too long.
EU/US summit
We would like to focus the twice-yearly summits on strategic themes that may run across several summits.
Finally, we will, I am sure, touch on the recent decisions at Nice on the European rapid reaction force.
The most important thing for us will be to consolidate, to examine very carefully the actual progress that has been made in the various programmes we have launched under the umbrella of the Transatlantic Agenda.
I know the Commission is now talking about reviving elements of its position for a new round, making it more flexible, and I look forward to knowing what that really means in practice.
It is impossible to accept that the only solution to crime and violence is further crime and violence.
We should be delighted to incorporate in that analysis a review of the way that the various dialogues have been developing.
We should take that position vigorously, without thinking that to do so will somehow undermine our relationship with our greatest friends and allies.
My military career was neither long nor distinguished, but I did learn that the role of the artillery was to bombard the infantry, if possible, the enemy infantry.
Secondly, the provision of digital products constitutes a provision of services rather than a delivery of goods.
Faced with this situation, the Commission ordered a study, which is the one we are investigating here, on what can be done.
In conclusion, let us say that we do not like to see the Commission giving up completely on VAT harmonisation at the beginning of its mandate, and Parliament, understanding the need to extend the validity of the legislation in force, being left waiting for the Commission, in the middle of its mandate and with the euro already in circulation, to present us with a new, full and thorough proposal on this matter.
In this sense, I welcome the Commission's brave attempt to find a way to close the competitive gap that clearly exists between EU and non-EU e-business.
As and when the train offers an equivalent alternative on an increasing number of routes, this alternative can be promoted.
I think that the fairest thing from the point of view of the different transport sectors and also from the point of view of competition is for us to lead the way and introduce aircraft fuel tax within the EU.
Yet we are all aware now that unfettered fiscal competition is detrimental to every one of us.
However, on account of the wide range of VAT rates, it will be necessary, as our rapporteur rightly proposes, to distribute VAT revenue fairly among the Member States by means of a clearing system.
A global view is required.
It would also create a much fairer situation between the different forms of transport.
I cannot, for instance, see why the introduction of the euro should require further or even any coordination of VAT rates.
We are familiar with the vital statistics: with taxes and public charges accounting for more than 45% of earned income, many of our Member States have budget deficits, whereas the United States, where taxes and public charges account for less than 30% of earned income, is achieving budget surpluses of several hundred billion dollars.
I would call upon the Commission to rethink the proposal and to think of an alternative way.
Coordinating and harmonising are not the same as standardising.
Mr President, it is truly touching to hear the purportedly angelic arguments in favour of promoting e-commerce, but here the problem we have is the real competitive disadvantage of our European companies, and the problem of correcting that situation by establishing certain rules, so that all services supplied to private individuals by electronic means in the European Union are subject to VAT.
That is precisely what we want to see for aircraft too.
Furthermore, this proposal is in line, as I see it, with the principles agreed at Ecofin, which in turn are in line with the agreed principles of the OECD Conference in Ottawa.
When air tickets are 42% cheaper today than they were ten years ago, it is clear that the wrong price signals are being given out.
The public at large deserves better.
That is not my view.
Mr President, I find the idea of a unilateral setting of EU aircraft fuel tax regimes entirely inappropriate, given that globally we are still subject to the Chicago Convention of 1944, exempting kerosene from taxation internationally.
It creates legal certainty for every individual saver and citizen.
This topic has been given much attention ever since the Commission introduced the proposal on 7 June of this year.
It is useful to have an objective and clear criterion at our disposal, namely the Member State where the consumer lives.
This is a simplification measure which regulates the exchange of information between the Member States on VAT numbers in the electronic trade, and we will take the proposal to heart in our future work in Parliament and the Council.
These discussions will prove very difficult, however, since the possibility of levying tax on aircraft fuel was not decided on at the previous general meeting.
This accident, which followed many others, gave rise to anger and despondency amongst the communities that were affected and within public opinion in general because of the opacity of the maritime sector and the inability of the legislation in force to prevent problems such as this.
The second objective is to simplify and speed up, in the case of accident, the communication of detailed information on dangerous and polluting cargoes, obliging ships and authorities to communicate the data electronically.
As far as liability is concerned, we must take a very careful look at that.
With regard to the black box, it should be pointed out that the International Maritime Organisation has laid down an obligation of this type for ships using national routes as from July 2008 and we wish this date to be brought forward.
Mr President, I should like in turn to thank Mrs de Palacio for her comments.
Question No 33 by (H-0873/00)
So is it acceptable that a vehicle may be stopped at the border of a neighbouring Member State if they comply with all the legal requirements in their own country?
They therefore do not contribute at all towards road infrastructure costs in Britain and at the same time pay lower vehicles taxes at home.
I am not in a position to give you exact figures in relation to the volume of imports of beef from third countries but I can say that such imports are governed by the appropriate regulations and that food safety considerations underlie that legislation.
Mr President, the Jews are the enemies of the prophets and believers.
So I repeat, we will pursue the issue with the Palestinian authorities.
The Merger Regulation provides no legal basis to take allegations of human rights abuses into account and the Commission therefore has no powers to investigate such alleged abuses in this context.
Conversely, Member States and the European Union have at their disposal other means to deal with human-rights-related issues.
In addition, if in the framework of the TBR procedure the Commission does not achieve a negotiated solution with Korea satisfactory for the European Union, the Commission will report to the Council by 1 May 2001 and will propose to bring the case to the WTO in order to seek remedy against unfair Korean practices.
And we must not forget that Mr Valdivielso de Cué asked you if the Commission believed that, without the aid which the shipbuilding industry had received, this industry would have been able to survive in the European Union.
Particular attention has been paid to the issue of employment.
Subject: Everything except armaments Is the Commission content that this dramatic proposal - which may well have dire consequences for already hard-pressed sugar beet farmers in the European Union - should be passed without any consultation of the directly-elected European Parliament?
Regarding Glenys Kinnock' s question concerning the link between this initiative and the Cotonou agreement, I should like to say again that the Commission entirely respected the spirit and the letter of the provisions of this agreement when it came to informing and consulting the ACP countries.
It is true that the price of sugar in the European Union is now three times higher than on the world market. This does indeed present a problem.
With regard to whether or not this is a tactical gesture designed to win the favour of least and less developed countries within the framework of a round of negotiations, I would point out straight away that this is not the case.
One of the four organisations is ECPAT, whose measures in this area during 2001, which are eligible for aid, are wholly covered by this application.
Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, this very night we shall be discussing the proposal for a Council Decision on European digital content.
A new article in the Treaty provides for a possible increase in the powers of the European Court in this sense.
I would like to be assured that the Commission will consider very carefully the virtues of such an approach, because I suspect a proliferation of jurisdictions may, in the end, fragment our legal systems.
What measures does the Commission plan to take to ensure that Member States which have not yet done so set up Community trade mark courts?
I thank Mr Berenguer Fuster for making such a strong plea to the Commission.
Commissioner, I have to confess that you have not enlightened me, or rather you have not told me anything which I did not know already, because this accusation was laid at the Commission's door a year ago.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply.
The diploma is then British.
Question No 49 by (H-0912/00)
At present we are looking for other more profitable ships and service operators to take the place of those that have now discontinued service, and the intention would be to combine passenger and freight traffic.
President, I welcome this initiative from the Commission.
Therefore it is necessary to shorten the implementation of the programme and it also enables this programme to have a much greater impact owing to the commitment of more money in shorter timescales.
I should like to know what will be included under the heading of 'content' .
There are no restrictions, as there were previously, to the supply of digital information.
The PPE-DE Group will endorse Mrs Gill's suggestions, for which I thank her, and we too shall vote for an increased contribution, and I hope that our agreement with the Liberals and the other groups will be honoured and that we shall make a really massive effort to ensure that these budgetary priorities actually receive the volume of additional funding that we have proposed.
The much-vaunted cultural and linguistic diversity of Europe is indeed a frequent barrier, especially in the context of the single market.
The programme and the report are therefore very important and, in connection with these, I want to thank the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen, as well as Mrs Gill.
We have to ensure that there is an environment conducive to these changes in Europe.
The remaining 11 are not directly compatible with the objectives of this specific programme, or would stretch its mandate beyond what can be achieved with the financial means associated with it.
What I would like to say to the PPE-DE Group is that it should at least not stand in the way of tonight' s discussions.
(Referral back of the report to committee was rejected)
Subsidiarity - as will soon transpire from the debate - is an important element which the Environmental Committee would like to honour.
Now that environmental noise has gone through the roof, increased mobility being one of the specific causes, the number of people facing this problem has also increased greatly.
The rapporteur has now quoted far higher percentages, but the fact is that ambient noise is a serious and a major environmental problem.
The rapporteur has shown great creativity in bringing forward framework directives, daughter directives and noise maps to be made available to the public.
This directive contains a number of sound and important proposals: harmonisation, the use of common indicators and parameters, software and such like.
In Spain and in many Mediterranean countries, the normal day extends considerably later than the 7.00 p.m. indicated in the directive.
We will have to progress down that road but the present proposal by the rapporteur goes too far in that direction at the moment.
The first thing we need for this is a framework directive which prescribes measuring procedures and action plans, thereby establishing the basis for a general standardisation of noise-abatement policies.
I would like to know what the bottom line actually was.
We will consider what these standards needs to be once we have the evidence from strategic noise maps.
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 3, 14, 18, 27, 30, 34, 35 and 43.
It seems that treatment with alginate may mislead the consumer, since the food may appear fresher than it really is.
I think that this would be of benefit to public health without causing any damage at all to industry.
Secondly, where is the preparedness of industry to come forward and accept that some of the many additives we have can be struck off?
Official inspections in the field of animal nutrition
During the trialogue, it became clear that the Council did not intend to shift from this position.
But how can guarantees be given if inspections have not taken place?
We must be careful not to take a top-down approach to what has to be a bottom-up initiative.
The small town/village renewal programme is an integral part of rural development.
Indeed, the concept of sustainable development, particularly in the case of cities and towns, is not, and cannot be, limited solely to the environmental aspect, but also embraces social and economic aspects.
Better knowledge and new technology provides the opportunity for a better environment in Europe's towns and cities.
It will enable and encourage towns and cities throughout Europe and beyond to come together and learn from each other's experiences, help them to tackle environmental problems and challenges and to work towards sustainability.
The second issue relates to commitology.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly late for us to be tackling the celebrated precautionary principle.
The text produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is the result of an ongoing search for a compromise or, rather, a balance between the maximalist and minimalist tendencies which were expressed in the course of our discussions, both of which result in excesses.
We must ensure that this report echoes public demands for a high level of protection for health and the environment.
Prudence is called for in situations where the risks are known.
So I am pleased to see that the final report reflects the need for further elaboration of the concept.
This proposes that a reversed burden of proof be applied regarding products with no prior approval, that is to say that producers must prove that the product is safe and not transfer the risks and the cost to consumers.
As everyone should know, our whole lives are fraught with risks and uncertainties.
Yet the way the European Union itself uses it is both unclear and even irrational.
But there are more examples than mad cow disease alone, examples which are perhaps not as spectacular, but where it is just as important to make decisions.
An analysis of the pros and cons is an absurd concept bearing in mind the idea behind the precautionary principle, namely to be able to react to a product before we fully know all the advantages and disadvantages.
The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council.
It is important to stress that it is for the decision-makers to define the level of protection.
It firmly condemns ETA' s crimes in Spain and invites the institutions of the European Union to adopt effective weapons to combat terrorism.
(Loud and sustained applause)
Non-nationalist elected officials are murdered, as well as businesspeople, journalists, members of the security forces or private individuals who have expressed themselves in any way against the project to impose independence.
But I do depend, of course, on the assistance of our services.
We shall restore your name as author of this amendment.
before the vote on Amendment No 51
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I am not at all convinced by the fact that large Swiss environmental organisations have been sweet-talked into this with the argument that the revenue from levies will benefit the expansion of rail.
We are delighted that this has now been acknowledged.
According to his plan, Luxembourg will continue to house no more than a handful of technical services such as the print shop and the translation service.
The budget for 2001 is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support.
The European Union is thereby now conceding, admittedly rather late in the day, the importance of substantial aid to the Republic of Yugoslavia, which is at a low ebb, and of doing so whilst respecting its borders.
This is a conspicuously weak conclusion.
By gradually deregulating the European market postal services can be made more efficient and the level of service to the customer raised.
How will the postal sector emerge from this period in which contradictions and controversies have been used to prop up the arguments, which are nevertheless often technical, that have been put together in the context of opening it up to competition?
the price and weight limits are set at reasonable levels, with weights of up to 150 grams remaining the sole preserve of the universal service, linked with a price ceiling of four times the public tariff.
The Commission' s proposal regarding postal services embodies an unrestrained desire to liberalise, threatening an essential public service along with the companies that provide it and the workers that perform it.
Parliament is thus sending the Commission a strong signal regarding its reservations on the total liberalisation of the postal market.
I do not feel that this is the right way to be spending the European Union's funds.
We do not wish to favour either the big sharks of the banana industry or the smaller sharks from the area under Europe' s protection.
In this context, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms forms a framework delineating the content for the sake of consumer protection.
The eContent programme is intended to encourage the development and the use of European digital content in the global networks and to promote linguistic diversity in the information society.
In the field of digital information, the linguistic vehicle holds a competitive advantage, a style of reasoning and a legal position that favour those in whose mother tongue it appears.
On the other hand, I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference announced for 2004, which seems to me to be the only positive outcome of Nice, will deal once and for all with the distribution of competences between the European Union and the governments of the Member States.
There was one positive aspect to the Nice European Council: by declaring a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of Members of the European Parliament that includes all of the candidate countries from the East, a powerful signal was given to these countries that we want to welcome them into the Union soon.
Despite a slight increase in the threshold for qualified majority voting, the scope of which remains to be seen, this extension is bound to mean that the gap will increase further still between the European institutions and national democracies.
A number of members of the European Parliament argued in very strong terms for the agenda to be expanded.
We still have a few months to work on this until the end of 2003 in order to save the European project.
Despite the successful efforts of the Nice Summit in this area, the resolution expresses dissatisfaction with the new extension of the scope of qualified majority.
On the contrary, the people of Europe and their Parliament have experienced a 'regression from Amsterdam'.
In fact, no other summit has ever had to face the prospect of such a vast expansion as this.
No steps are being taken to make the EU more democratic or to increase the power of the national parliaments.
We pensioners often travel and, to tell the truth, train and car journeys are tiring: for us, aeroplanes are a dream come true.
'Okay, I'll walk.'
This approach should have our support, because the gap between developed and backward regions is far greater in terms of technological development than in terms of Gross Domestic Product.
Mr President, I should like to comment in a very favourable light on Mr Markov's report and to congratulate him on putting such a constructive report before the House.
Therefore, innovative factors like this one, however humble, must not be undervalued by anyone.
This very technology, on the other hand, presents them with a means of making up the leeway, provided that the economic players in the regions are capable of using innovative measures to grasp the opportunities available to them.
Of course, if we want to be consistent, this call needs to be accompanied by a restriction on tiresome bureaucracy, Commissioner, at all stages of the procedure for including and implementing programmes.
One especially good feature of this initiative is that it has enabled women in particular to familiarise themselves with new information technology and its applications.
If the Berlin reform for the 7 years dealt with by Agenda 2000, that is to say for the period 2000-2006, reduced the budgetary contributions for these actions by half in comparison with the previous period and, to that, we add the inevitable slowness with which we adopt decisions at a Community level, as a result of our complex institutional structure, it is not surprising that we are in a situation where we have not even been able to spend the budget laid down for the current year for innovative regional policy measures, and this is an example of political irresponsibility.
Compared with the priority topics which were selected and which I wanted to present personally to the Committee on Regional Policy on 11 September, I should like to remind you that these innovative measures are first and foremost a regional development instrument.
We have taken certain aspects on board in order to help SMEs find ways of meeting their needs for staff with computing skills.
I must be content, as must you, with the funds provided in the Berlin guidelines and the Agenda 2000 package.
South Korea has received more than 40% of all the shipbuilding orders that have been placed in the year 2000, according to the Commission report; it has been able to do this on the basis of loans from South Korean banks, some of which are state-owned, by virtue of state guarantees which are tantamount to subsidisation.
I hope that the timing of the presentation of that report to Parliament was not a ploy to encourage us to take this item off the agenda.
More importantly, we have also taken note of the Council's conclusions of 5 December, a Council which agreed to safeguard the future by standing its ground with South Korea and not dismissing the possibility of reintroducing shipbuilding aid in May for the specific market segments hardest hit by Korean competition.
It is true that Europe is suffering from unfair competition because in Korea, above all, very low salaries are paid and workers are forced to endure abysmal working conditions and, under these circumstances, European workers have no way of competing with them.
This transparent form of support discourages European yards from applying all kinds of reduction or marketing methods which do not conform to the market.
There, these days, what were once shipyards are now concert halls, maritime museums etc. In these shipyards, 4 000 people once worked, and now just a couple of doormen work in each place, and that is what is happening in the European countries.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Langen on the quality of his report.
As a result of this failure, a complaint by industry under the trade barrier regulation has been launched in October this year and Commissioner Lamy announced on 4 December the Commission's decision to open an investigation.
This would be proposed if a satisfactory agreement with Korea cannot be achieved during the course of the investigation procedure under the trade barriers regulation.
He was a worker and, like those who accompanied us yesterday when we awarded the Sakharov Prize, he was a private citizen who served the democratic system which the Spanish have chosen.
Once upon a time there was a British nuclear submarine called the Tireless.
I am not being alarmist.
In both, we ask the Commission to examine the possibilities contained in the current Treaties to ascertain what opportunities it has to contribute to this issue.
So, over these months, we have been on a wild goose chase.
She regrets that she cannot be here to answer the questions in person because she is engaged in meetings in Brussels to prepare for next week's important ministerial meeting on climate change.
In reply to whether an intervention plan exists for the area of Gibraltar and the port of Gibraltar, the British authorities have drawn the Commission's attention to the existence of the Gibraltar public safety scheme, known as "Gibpubsafe", which is the intervention plan for Gibraltar.
The first point I would like to make is that the repairs to the cooling system of this submarine are already under way.
This problem with the submarine has to be settled calmly and with full cooperation between all interested, relevant authorities.
Maybe the incident is serious, maybe it is not.
For him it is cause for complaint, to us it is cause for satisfaction: that is the only difference between us.
There is no way that this situation can be treated as a bilateral affair between two Member States which belong to a political union.
The interests of the people of Gibraltar and southern Spain are identical in this regard.
The Spanish Government, from the outset, has held a position based on two points: the need for transparent information, based on technical and scientific criteria, in order to assess the scope of the repairs and their potential risk; and also, the view that any decision, either on its repair in Gibraltar or on its removal to a naval base in the British Isles, be taken in accordance with rigorous technical principles.
B5-0901/2000 by Sylla and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
The real reason is not so much the anniversary as it is the UN refugee organisation' s current plight.
That is not enough, however: we must give our determined support to the UNHCR, both in political and economic terms, to ensure there is a balance between the issues of predictability, flexibility and geographical location.
Anyone who was at the recent exhibition in the European Parliament and who studied the pictures and the script dealing with the work of the UNHCR in the world at the moment I think would agree that it is one of the saddest exhibitions that we have ever had the misfortune to see in our Parliament.
These meetings should help the Commission provide the more predictable and transparent funding that UNHCR requests and has long called for, while at the same time assisting UNHCR in rendering a better service to those in need.
B5-0902/2000 by Morgantini and Frahm, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
That is the second problem.
The new political leadership in Serbia must act in such a way, and I would like to point this out, Mr President, so that the former president and dictator Milosevic, together with his partners in crime, can be brought before the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
We either expect a clear amnesty law in the short term with specific details or, and preferably in combination with, a concrete date for the release of the political prisoners.
So much has changed since the autumn: the new authorities in Belgrade have moved fast, for example to restore international contacts; they have moved fast to enable the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to take its place at the United Nations and, as well, to take its place in the OSCE.
B5-0911/2000 by Grossetête, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
Human Rights in Tunisia- B5-0905/2000 by Boudjenah and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
And, on one occasion, General Pinochet decided to come to Europe and, as soon as he set foot here, the European judicial authorities set out to ensure that General Pinochet took responsibility for his actions.
I also express the support of our Group for the amendment from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the non-interference of military powers in the process.
The peaceful and democratic pursuit of political ends is not just a means to an end; it is intrinsic in any worthwhile end itself.
So long as this situation prevails the country cannot be considered for membership negotiations with the European Union.
I am pleased because I think that, when it is not a vulgar sham, a hunger strike is a suicidal undertaking which my personal beliefs forbid me from encouraging.
Some, such as Béchir Habid, are in a critical condition.
Even if a few passports have been returned, even if President Ben Ali delivered a speech on the freedom of the press and improved prison conditions on the anniversary of his taking power, there has been a marked deterioration in the human rights situation in Tunisia.
At least 1 000 people are still imprisoned for the sake of their views.
The young student Béchir Habid has been on hunger strike since 18 October.
I witnessed powers being handed over within the human rights league a week before it was placed in official receivership.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Public declarations were made after these events deploring the use of violence and supporting measures to bring to justice those found to be responsible for it.
On the financial front, and this responds directly to the important point made by the honourable Member and it is an area where we have some experience in other countries, Commission representatives in Tunis are stepping up their efforts to launch very soon two programmes: one in support of journalists and the other in support of non-governmental organisations.
If this policy continues, there will be a bloodbath, just like the bloodbaths we have seen in other countries.
Let us hope that they will have the courage to take it up and we shall spare no effort in helping them do so.
In order for the elections to really unblock the current situation, we first need to create the conditions for those elections to be held in a climate of civil peace and reconciliation.
Mr Ouattara is not Ivorian and it is perfectly normal, as it would be in each of our own countries, for Côte d'Ivoire to refuse to allow people who are not Ivorian citizens to hold office.
During the debate on the British submarine in Gibraltar you indicated that the Gibraltar Public Safety scheme document would be made available to colleagues of the House.
Mr President, I wish to follow the example of Mr Wurtz and formally withdraw our motion for a resolution as well.
I sense that we are going to have a whole new debate on the issue.
I shall take your speech as an appeal for more assiduous attendance.
Indeed, as we are aware, health does not last forever.
It is set against the background of the 'International Year of Older Persons' , as proclaimed by the UN, and it is also very important that attention has been focused in various places on how the situation of the elderly will develop in the future, for example, in the countries of the European Union.
Those were the exception to the rule, for the large majority of people died at a relatively young age due to adverse conditions.
In this area of policy, European institutions hardly have any authority.
People need each other' s care and attention; they rely on each other.
The years go by: our work causes us to fall ill, we pay pension contributions and national insurance contributions; we pay rates and taxes.
However, extensive early retirement and various graduated terms of retirement presuppose a massive revision of these policies because not all of them are socially inspired.
That reminds me of the debate in the sixties about keeping us women out of the labour market.
Mr President, like the rapporteur, whom I must congratulate, I too shall take as my starting point the obvious statement that, in terms of the population pyramid, Europe is an ageing continent.
As a member of the Friday Club - which admittedly is not an official group but in practice does exist - I am one of the hosts of the Members present today, as you are, and I hope that we will also manage this next year.
Anyone who is satisfied with the average will never embark on the adventure of a committed life.
It is crucial that we develop concrete policies and specific programmes for the various categories of elderly people.
We are certainly facing tremendous challenges.
Not everyone can or should retire voluntarily from working life.
(Laughter and applause)
It would therefore be appropriate to set as the date of entry into force of the regulation the date of adoption of the implementing regulation, so as not to lose the appropriations available in 2001.
Firstly, it should be pointed out how good agricultural products, such as fruit, milk etc. are for you.
We want to stay healthy, and food is the overall basis for healthy living.
From this point of view, campaigns for information provision and promotion, cofinanced by the European Union and the Member States, are essential both to help restore the somewhat tarnished image of agriculture in the eyes of consumers and, moreover, to bring about recognition of the excellent quality of the very great majority of our agricultural products.
Or what about when people say that we have a shortage of protein?
It cannot reasonably be the taxpayers' and the European Union' s business to finance advertising campaigns to encourage people, for example, to buy tulips or eat more apples.
Spending under the last programme actually fell between 1997 and 1998.
Mr Mulder is right when he said that the common agriculture policy is designed not only for food but also for the social objective of keeping the maximum number of people in rural areas.
The final group of amendments which the Commission cannot accept are amendments which are at odds with the proposal, those which could have unwelcome consequences and those in which administrative procedures are proposed which are not customary practice.
Because it is actually true that it is certainly necessary, but also right, to promote the European model of agriculture.
In those times, the Rule of Saint Benedict required monks to drink one 'hemina' , or about half a pint, of wine before meals in order to awaken the spirit and aid digestion.
I find this really quite dreadful: it contradicts the letter of the Treaty, and I hope that it will not happen.
We know all too well that the present Treaties are inadequate and that the Union will need a better and different structure in future, a more constitutional structure which clearly distinguishes the powers of the Member States and those of the Union.
These are, first and foremost, messages of concern at the economic and social problems that we are experiencing, in spite of a period of sustained growth stemming from years of efforts by all our fellow citizens.
The current situation, which is intolerable, particularly for many independent haulage firms and for agriculture, does in any case need to be improved.
An agreement on procedures in itself is a good thing, but we must make sure that the system cannot be used as a political weapon.
They too now have a clear idea of the rights which they have to respect.
I agree with him on the need to guard against a return to intergovernmental methods, which some find appealing.
There are many of us who want a federation of nation states, which means that each state must find the position that best suits it.
The rapporteurs have already stressed the quality of the debate and the need to progress further, and I can only agree with them.
In reply, I would say that, before making a speech, one must identify all the major factors at work, familiarise oneself with them and weigh them up, for political discourse must always be realistic, respond to the real weight of the forces at work and relate to the aims we all set ourselves.
I would like us to use closer cooperation to generate fresh potential for Europe.
The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12.
I will vote to approve the draft regulation.
Indeed, the reports of the European Court of Auditors continually comment on understating of this type, from Greece to Portugal.
We did not, consequently, vote in favour of this report.
According to those in favour, such buses are not only cheaper and internationally deployable, they are also more environmentally-friendly because they use less fuel per passenger.
He also calls for benchmarking to spread best practice across the EU.
A binding and all-embracing charter with completely legally enforceable rights could result in difficulties at a later stage.
I would thank both of them for their magnificent efforts.
We do not, however, believe that the latter can be concluded in Nice in less than three months, for which reason alone we cannot vote in favour of incorporating the Charter into the Treaty at the Nice Summit.
The CSU's Europe group welcomes the tabling of the final draft of the Charter of Fundamental Rights because it summarises and makes visible the fundamental rights which the public are entitled to in respect of the institutions and bodies of the EU.
It is an accurate reflection of the liberal Europe which is being built.
I would indeed have like to have seen a moratorium on this Charter to enable work to continue on it, as a great many non-governmental organisations in the various countries of the European Union have proposed.
(A5-0248/2000) by Mr Queiró on Hungary (COM(1999) 505 - C5-0028/2000 - 1997/2175(COS));
That is why I should like to propose to you that from next year we in Parliament no longer present a general report at all but only country reports, to make it clear that we wish to see the negotiations proceed at differentiated paces.
I feel, then, that on the basis of the work undertaken by previous presidencies and by the Commission, the French Presidency will be in a position, or so I hope, at least, to offer a quite precise overview of the accession process at the European Council in Nice.
I have said, and I have no problem saying it again here today, that the French Presidency will not duck any of the problems that are raised. This does not, of course, mean that we shall have the time and resources to deal with each of them.
This is, of course, a perfectly legitimate question, but it is one that must be answered quite properly and precisely.
Enlargement is a wide-ranging goal which we must approach with a great deal of generosity and with vision.
A specific outcome is needed from the Intergovernmental Conference if we are to do justice to the tremendous pressure for adaptation.
The second major change which we are witnessing and to which Europe must adjust is the meteoric speed at which the economy is moving towards a global market and global competition.
Fourthly: this results in another principle whereby the countries which joined later have a fair chance of catching up with those that began earlier.
Where major, long-term investments are needed in order to attain EU standards, we must bear in mind that even the present members claimed long transitional periods in such cases.
Border security and the fight against crime will also be governed by our standards and will benefit from European cooperation.
Let us examine the trade flows between the European Union and the Central and Eastern European countries.
I was pleased that the Commissioner at long last started to dispel the aforementioned fears of the people.
But one point is clear - and I welcome the fact that Mr Verheugen has underlined this once more: there can be no transitional period for complying with democratic rules.
We need the Commission's help here, because even though we have the will, we sometimes lack the ammunition.
This is vital for us, the European Union, in order for us to be able to set targets for ourselves with regard to completing our own internal reforms.
However, we disagree on some important issues.
This damages the Union, its future independence in relation to the United States and also a common European defence and security policy, since it also introduces risks with regard to Russia and other countries.
We hope that results will be achieved and that another Intergovernmental Conference will not have to be held in order to prepare adequately for enlargement.
I shall be brief, as indeed I was earlier, since my first speech was three minutes under the allotted speaking time.
It is very important, and therefore I am pleased that the Commission is working on an information campaign which Commissioner Verheugen wishes to make both extensive and decentralised.
However, and this will be my last word, as I want to get my point across clearly: I am no pessimist on the subject, I do not want to do things by halves, I want to see a strong option with regard to enlargement - in order to be credible, we must also be serious, we must make ourselves clearly understood, and we must also be able to gain the allegiance of the nations, the peoples of the candidate countries and also our own peoples.
For now, I see no need to discuss the financial perspectives in connection with enlargement.
I cannot say that today of any one country.
Which is also why they expressed their wish to join the European Union.
The various rapporteurs will now speak.
I have been entrusted with the task of acting as rapporteur where Estonia is concerned.
As a conservative, I am incredibly thrifty with taxpayers' money.
Only then, I think, can you have any notion of what the people of Latvia have achieved over recent years.
It is not enough; the whole strategy needs to be geared more to the citizens.
Lithuania has considerable potential for long-term economic growth.
In the widest sense, what is at stake here is cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation.
This brings us to another sore point: public support, both within and outside the European Union.
As a result of clever fiscal policy, direct foreign investment topped EUR 5.45 billion last year.
We should not interfere, especially we Germans!
Slovak democracy is developing at a steady pace, which has not always been the case.
In this speech, I propose to highlight and discuss the six aspects of Hungary' s changing situation with a view to its accession to the European Union, which warrant specific mention.
I am therefore pleased to see that it has been addressed in Mr Brok' s general report on enlargement.
This is nowhere more true than in the case of nuclear power, where legitimate concerns over nuclear and environmental safety are in danger of being hijacked by the anti-nuclear power lobby.
The formation of a high level group is something that I commend to my colleagues.
The report which it is my honour to submit, which was also unanimously adopted in committee, observes that the part of the territory controlled by the legal authority fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria.
To this end, a key role will fall, without prejudice obviously to the Commission' s own role, to our High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Javier Solana.
Malta' s main problem is still that the accession process is judged differently by the government and by the opposition, while the European Union just wants to be sure that the accession process progresses steadily.
Even the levels between the USA and Mexico are closer together, which is why we are in favour of a considered, flexible strategy which does justice to the challenge in the area of the internal market.
Allow me also to say at this point that I have a great deal of respect for the citizens of the central and eastern European countries who, ten years ago, had the courage to go into the streets and start this process.
The information society is important to old as well as new sectors.
We should not be blinded by the percentage figures of community law transposed into national legislation.
The ten new countries in Eastern Europe can only dream of having a rich sugar daddy such as that.
This also applies to the inhuman transport of live animals to slaughterhouses.
Now we are moving to a requirement for health impact assessments for all major legislation.
My report is also bound to discuss the European Union and has to demonstrate that the European funds for regional development cannot continue to be granted on the basis of a simple distribution of money between regions or districts.
Elmar Brok rightly started his intervention by saying that we all stand to benefit from enlargement, especially those of us on this side of the current external borders.
Internal waterway transport will be important for environmental reasons, because we must get heavy freight off the roads and, if it cannot be carried by rail, then we must use waterways.
Egoism and, especially, populism have also played their part. Nor, certainly, has the falling rate of the euro helped things in the right direction.
Our message to the accession candidates is the following: do not get overwhelmed by the number of reports and dossiers before us.
Unfortunately, there are too many parties at the moment which have shed their ideological feathers and, as a result, display too little ambition and too much materialism.
If there is a need to postpone the free right to acquire land and property for family use, then let us do that.
It exists so far, but will possibly be jeopardised by a bureaucratic lack of transparency and the obvious, but not public resistance of certain governments.
For where are the millions of jobs promised by the Maastricht Treaty?
Now that we are engaged in reviewing the Treaties, some States are already calling for a new reform.
The vast majority of international investigations point to macroeconomic gains in connection with enlargement.
However, with the exception of insignificant minorities, no political group is questioning the principle objective of the Slovenian policy which is to join the European Union as soon as possible.
If the Union were to enlarge rapidly it would have to decentralise dramatically, as was stated in the ELDR Group' s position on enlargement.
It is clear to me that the institutional, ordered regime which operates in that country results in many long-term health consequences for orphaned children.
I would urge you to support the relevant amendments.
And even the European politicians have insufficient insight into the negotiating process.
Cyprus will be a sort of bridge with the countries in the area.
I wish the negotiators continued success with their work in this important area.
Of course the second form of communication we need is that between the Member States and the candidate countries, in order to convey what it is that is important from the European Union' s perspective.
We cannot afford to lose more of the momentum that existed at the beginning of the Nineties.
Mr President, first of all, as Socialist rapporteur for the report on Romania, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report.
The institutions, the Member States, and all of us, have to live up to this challenge, also in relation to the fears of public opinion in our own countries and to rediscover the inspiration, the ambition and the vision of the founding fathers of Europe.
Unfortunately, it seems to me, that for all the fine words and industrious opening and closing of chapters, the Council is not applying the political pressure needed to drive this enlargement process forward.
Many countries have faced similar problems at some time in their development and can advise Bulgaria in order to help it to overcome those problems it is facing at the moment.
Democracy is not just about majorities, more than anything it is about minorities being given commensurate codecision powers.
The applicant countries must have equal status and their accession must depend only how much progress they have made.
At the same time we should recognise the efforts made by countries like Lithuania to, as it were, make up for lost time.
That being so, it is in our interests to extend our system of rights and freedoms as far as Romania, and this is certainly an argument we can use in a critical debate with our public.
People do, however, rally in large numbers around one issue, namely that of enlargement.
My group therefore supports the proposal to limit the transitional periods in the environmental sphere to a maximum of five years.
Mr President, it is essential for us to adopt a positive approach to enlargement.
Certainly, the debate over the order in which the countries are to join the Union remains open, partly because the state of progress of their internal reforms will have to be assessed.
I am delighted that the report has turned out to be so positive and that Slovenia - and as leader of the delegation I was able to check this out repeatedly, and in fact the Commissioner was there with me on more than one occasion - has made truly enormous efforts to fulfil the criteria.
I think the suggestion is worth looking into.
Both the EU and the candidate states should now be doing their utmost to condemn and fight these forms of violence and the trade in women.
Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to endorse the thoughts and concerns of many of my fellow members regarding the need for an assiduous and long-overdue examination of the question of the borders of Europe and, consequently, of the extent of enlargement, and the need, if any, for a special report on the subject by the European Parliament.
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Thank you.
From time to time it is rightly said in this House that a citizens' Europe would be a Europe in which rights were properly enshrined in the law of the Union.
I shall now put the request from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for a postponement to the vote.
We know that the foreign substances in question are very rarely acutely poisonous substances, but are long-term and long-lived substances which can build up, such as dioxin and aflotoxin and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury.
We cannot find the culprits.
If this type of dilution is permitted, there must at least be a requirement to notify the monitoring bodies, and the fact that such dilution occurs must be made public, because the public also need to be aware of this problem and discuss it.
One thing must be clearly emphasised: the dioxin crisis was the result of criminal infringements of the existing rules and regulations.
Mr President, may I thank my colleagues who have already spoken.
This was absolutely vital.
The value limit for fish meal, for example, is different to the level proposed for non-marine animal derived products.
It is time to break with a misguided interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity, which attempts to increase Brussels' s hold on our nations a little more each day.
Like the rapporteur, I believe that there is a case for doing all these things and for looking at the substances she referred to when they are not in themselves toxic but show increases in the aggregated levels.
Unfortunately, a lot of inherited knowledge and farmers' lore has been lost in industrial agriculture, where animals have been reduced to production units and commodities.
The new regulations will merge, harmonise and simplify very detailed and complex hygiene requirements which were previously scattered over numerous directives.
The number of those who seek precise details on ingredients is relatively small, according to my research.
Secondly, for farmers, who are, of course, the producers of primary feed materials, there will in fact be a change, because in future they will have to destroy considerably higher percentages of their feed materials.
Compensation is necessary, although it is obvious that farmers themselves are concerned about the wellbeing of their animals.
Amendment No 18 explicitly proposes to include water in the definition of feedingstuff.
On the basis of these scientific risk assessments the Commission will propose to the Member States appropriate measures to limit the presence of these substances in feedingstuffs.
Considering the amendments tabled for adoption in this plenary session, I appreciate Parliament's support of the proposal.
Overall therefore, the Commission can fully accept 15 of the 27 amendments.
I assume that they will not succeed this time.
The Commission has pledged itself to work on this list and has also said it is not something that can be done in a couple of days.
Farmers quite simply have to know more precisely what is in their compound feedingstuffs, and they must also be able to find out, at least on request, the percentage content of each ingredient.
Finally, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as well as to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for their contributions, and I hope that the Council will adopt a constructive position on this matter, so that we can jointly arrive at a transparent system of declarations for feedingstuffs.
This is, of course, all due to the BSE tragedy that turned into a real saga, with several episodes.
Contaminants which affect human and animal health are unacceptable.
But let us begin with the good news.
The present proposal is the first in a series of initiatives based on the White Paper on food safety.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0248/2000) by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the European Parliament resolution on Hungary's membership application to the European Union and the state of negotiations (COM(1999) 505 - C5-0028/2000 - 1997/2175(COS))
Report (A5-0247/2000) by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the European Parliament resolution on Romania's membership application to the European Union and the state of negotiations (COM(1999) 510 - C5-0033/2000 - 1997/2171(COS))
Thirdly, perhaps the most difficult, that the Council agrees new institutional arrangements that allow the Community to function efficiently, effectively and democratically after enlargement.
Even if one approves of the principles of Article 13, it is quite clear that derived legislation that the European Union may draw from it sometimes goes too far, and that there are no grounds for refusing candidate countries the right to cultural diversity.
Lastly, I wish to stress the fact that the enlargement process must be a gradual one, following the pace at which the candidate countries are making the necessary changes.
. (ES) In the current context and given that we are beginning to hear enlargement being questioned in certain quarters, it is important that this Parliament sends a clear political signal in support of it.
. (FR) Since its inception, the European Union has sought to bring peoples closer together.
The criteria laid down at the Copenhagen Council in 1993 on democratisation or the ability to withstand competition actually strengthen the hand of unrestrained, destructive capitalism, in the guise of acquis communautaire.
A headlong rush into enlargement, under such conditions, would be liable to aggravate the sidelong shifts towards the populist and fascistic which are appearing here and there.
It so happens that we have a report on equal opportunities for men and women on the agenda for this very sitting, a report which once more illustrates how stunted the body of Community practice still is in this particular area.
For indeed, who could deny entry into the European House to States such as the Poland of Copernicus and John Paul II, the Hungary bullied in Budapest in 1956 or the capital that has become a symbol, Prague, when popular democracies threw the Head of State out of the window and crushed the nation of Jan Palach, sacrificed in the name of freedom.
A larger Europe with more tasks and responsibilities will require fresh, increased financial resources.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of Estonia, in the hope that we will look after their interests once they join the European Union.
If Latvia continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Latvia should not be admitted to the Union.
If Lithuania continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Lithuania should not be admitted to the Union.
Progress is also evident in the field of the environment, where the 'National Fund for Protection of the Environment' has been implemented and the 'polluter pays' principle applied.
In welcoming Poland to our common home, the European Union will be doing justice to a newcomer, justice that has been denied to it for far too long.
I look forward to early membership for the Czech Republic.
. I welcome the Queiró report on Hungary's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws.
I look forward to Bulgaria joining the Union in the not too distant future.
Poos Report (A5-0249/2000)
This is a balanced and fair position, which the Council of Ministers must take into serious consideration.
In this connection, I would hope that the talks conducted under the auspices of the United Nations will be able to come to a successful conclusion enabling the Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations to enjoy the advantages of membership of the European Union in the context of a reunified republic.
. I warmly welcome Mr Poos' report on Cyprus's application for membership of the European Union.
Yet we consumers are the last stage in the food chain, and hence the final recipients of the abuses and counterfeits in the food industry.
We are particularly keen to implement in a practical manner at European level this concept of food safety from the stable to the table, or from the pitchfork to the fork.
It is precisely because we are in favour of developing genuinely fraternal cooperation relationships between genuinely equal partners, between all the countries of the world, that we have no intention of endorsing this double talk by voting in favour.
The Council informed Parliament before the vote in committee, but only just before, deliberately ruling out any chance of further debate with myself or Parliament.
In my report, I have called for greater representation and involvement of NGOs, greater accountability to Parliament, the production of an annual report to be debated by Parliament, the highest possible degree of transparency, promotion of remembrance of the past in the fight against prejudice and the recognition of multiple discrimination.
At the same time, the workers' legitimate interests need to be considered.
Since they are mainly responsible for settling questions of discrimination at the workplace, the social partners are best placed to work out viable solutions.
Jenny was from the Access Charter, she was the coordinator for the group and I invited her to the hearings on Article 13.
They also form part of a practical policy because directives and action programmes encourage the Member States to fight discrimination on the basis of the same guiding principles and because the Commission can fulfil its role as Guardian of the Treaties but also as a pioneer in the social debate.
Although the present legal basis releases appropriations for new preparatory actions, their funding within this category could lead to a reduction in appropriations for other policies.
Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a framework directive is necessary but not sufficient, and we will have the opportunity to improve its mechanisms once the implementation period is over.
I hope the Commission will look carefully at gender discrimination legislation in the light of this new directive.
I congratulate the Commission and my colleagues who drew up the report.
I applaud the recommendation of the Mann report to offer ideological organisations the opportunity to prescribe the functions required of staff with this background in mind.
The speed with which the institutions have deployed the new Amsterdam powers, Commissioner, show that the European Union is still in the vanguard of equal opportunities, and I would like to extend my express thanks to the European Commission for this.
The fact that so many different forms of discrimination exist in our societies confirms the importance of the Action Programme that is the subject of Mr Cashman' s report.
Mr President, on behalf of the Bonino List, I would like to express our great consternation at the Member States' approach to the issues of discrimination, racism and xenophobia.
Could the Commissioner explain why the Commission is not taking this on board?
My second point is the problem that NGOs, important as they may be, are being asked to be involved in implementing the programme regardless of their size, nature and activities.
The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has assessed all this with positive results, particularly focusing on the activity of Parliament, which insisted, in addition and above all, on preventive action as well as good practice.
That is a challenge to all of us because we all judge people on initial impressions.
Mr President, combating discrimination and passing legislation against it means acknowledging that is exists and that many forms of it are in a sense 'decriminalised' because they are so commonplace.
In Geneva in 1963, the first of these, UNCTAD, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, established the principle of compensatory inequalities or, in other words, discrimination.
In fact, information and awareness campaigns are vital in this area: they must act as hammers to forge new mentalities and bring about a new way of thinking and behaving, in order to drive out those prejudices which are still widespread and to ensure equal rights for all citizens.
It is therefore important to press forward with the two legislative initiatives that are now being debated, while improving them in certain respects and increasing the funds set aside for financing the programme, thus reflecting the political importance of this fight against discrimination.
In particular the agreement of the principle of reasonable accommodation, pioneered in Sweden and Ireland, will now ensure that employers across Europe adapt their workplaces, acquire specialist equipment and amend their working practices so that disabled employees really do get a fair chance.
Article 13 is the starting point for a new EU objective: to combat discrimination or inequality in the treatment of citizens for the reasons listed therein.
The second thing I want to point out is that, with this first package, the Commission has unfortunately committed a serious error by itself putting reasons for discrimination in order of priority.
Mr President, discrimination on religious grounds is as unacceptable as any other form of discrimination.
As a confirmed secularist, I could not possibly endorse it.
Yet even today the generous idea of granting each citizen the greatest possible freedom, provided it is compatible with the same measure of freedom for others, still comes up against obstacles - some de facto, others de jure.
One of the directives has already been adopted in record time, and I am quite optimistic that the other one will be adopted during the French Presidency in November.
Some are not in conformity with other legal requirements, for example the amendment concerning the committees' arrangements.
On the contrary, I cannot accept Amendment No 38 which proposes to delete from Article 5 the list of differences of treatment on grounds of age, which could be justified.
You have addressed the important question of contract compliance.
It is the first time that we allow joint projects in this action programme.
Clearly the more global the code the more effective it will be.
Article 7 of the code commits Member States to prevent exports being diverted to undesirable end users.
Mr President, I have to confess to a certain nostalgia for the times when the European Parliament - and the various pacifist movements and trade unions - used to call urgently for dedication and action in order to steadily reduce arms manufacturing, and we would discuss ways of converting military production into civilian production.
In consideration of the situation of the world today and of this continent, following the end of the cold War and the breaking of the balance established by the dread fear of weapons of mass destruction, such an attitude would be highly irresponsible.
In a sense, these arms have come to symbolise anarchy in many areas worldwide.
CFSP covers crisis management activity outside the EU' s borders and nothing which can be described as a common defence policy.
These aim at preventing the export of weapons to governments which abuse human rights, to areas of conflict or to regions engaged in arms races.
The Commission, in close collaboration with the Member States, was actively involved in the drafting of the European Union joint action on small arms and light weapons.
The next item is the Commission communication on the European research area.
The introduction of types of intervention of longer duration; half-way houses between support for projects and institutional financing, the use of the variable geometry instruments available under the Treaty, and, more specifically, European Union participation in national programmes, as provided for in Article 169 of the Treaty.
This ranking is precisely the characteristic that we want to enhance, and it is dependent on the level of the method of intervention.
You said that you have a total shake-up of the framework programme in mind.
I feel that what is currently required is something that structures the European Research Area, which is to say something that goes beyond the framework programme and supplements national programmes; we need a structuring element, which means that we have to agree on certain rules.
As concerns discussions with the STOA Unit, I feel that we have to act together, since this is something that concerns this House, the Joint Research Centre and the technological foresight institutes in the various Member States.
The Commission appears to be moving quickly towards shaping the European Research Area.
There will be an entire chapter on science, society and the citizens.
Meetings have been held with the Greek, Irish and Portuguese authorities to ask the governments of these countries to speed up their presentation to the Commission of their Cohesion Fund projects.
Perhaps the lack of staff you have just mentioned exclusively devoted to the Cohesion Fund - who did exist in the former Commission - prevented you from having more concrete details.
My second question is this: besides the Cohesion Fund, there are also the Community Support Framework, the Structural Fund, regional programmes, etc. From which countries have you received definitive projects, and which programmes from which countries have you already approved?
In 1989, the Commission submitted a new proposal which was to offer more flexibility.
I appreciate the points Mr Bolkestein made and I know that the principal rule in the treaties prohibits charging foreigners more than home companies, but the general law of fair competition in Europe ought to apply and where levels of taxation are totally disproportionate we should look at the effect competition law can have on the situation, despite the general rule that these matters are the prerogative of Member States.
If you want to conserve fuel, the way to do it is through fuel duty, not other forms of taxation.
I should like to say to Mr Purvis that the matter of natural, regional disadvantages is probably a matter for the national governments since a part of their electorate lies in those outlying areas and peripheral regions.
Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for that information.
Last spring and summer the European Commission carried out a general review of its activities and human resources.
Tasks of that kind do exist.
These children are increasingly exploited by tourists and businessmen who, remarkably often, come from Europe.
The Commission believes that all undertakings will be able to prepare themselves in time for the final changeover to the euro, including the adaptation of their computer systems and software.
This philosophical political discussion is no longer on the agenda, but in general we can discuss the dangers of a referendum, but perhaps in some other context.
This applies also to moose.
A reminder has been recently sent to the French authorities.
In relation to candidate countries I can tell you that meetings have taken place with them in relation to this issue of transport of animals and preliminary agreements have been reached.
However, in this year's spring sowing season the Commission was informed of interceptions of imported seed of conventional varieties of different species including cotton containing traces of GM seed.
However, having consulted with his services, I am in a position to inform you that essential safety requirements concerning computer equipment to be used privately or in the working place are prescribed by a directive relating to electrical products, the Low Voltage Directive, as well as by the Directive on Radio Equipment and Telecommunication Terminals.
Would he agree with me that it is a false distinction to draw here, however, between safety in the workplace and safety in the schoolroom or safety for a child working at home?
Perhaps he will shake hands with President Khatami.
Today Aung San Suu Kyi is now under de facto house arrest.
So I am reluctant to go further on trade or to advise further action on trade or investment.
Question No 15 by (H-0769/00):
They referred to some of the election meetings, for example, that they had gone to.
Questions 16 to 44 will be replied to in writing.
What we would like to see is a consolidated European report which should be published and scrutinised by this Parliament.
We should be focusing on the conversion to non-weapons production instead of on how we will compete with the other weapons manufacturing countries around the world.
The five permanent members of the Security Council, who are supposed to watch over our security, should listen to these proposals and negotiate an arrangement truly worthy of the twenty-first century as quickly as possible.
Today's debate marks an important step in the reform process that was initiated by the Prodi Commission just over one year ago.
I cannot help but feel that in the race to produce a proposal within the time limit set by the Reform White Paper, the Commission failed to focus properly on the detail.
I therefore propose that both the financial controller and the internal auditor should produce annual reports detailing their activities.
The Van Hulten report is right to define further the discrepancy put forward by the Commission and sets the right tone for exchanging best practices among institutions.
I hope we will not see a repeat performance here!
If we lay something down for large institutions, the neutrality principle proposed by the Committee of Independent Experts should then apply across the board.
In the past we often found that excessively lengthy decision-making processes disappointed the applicants and led to a loss of confidence in the European institutions.
I wish to say, Commissioner, that this report is only an interim measure, which means that it is the first step towards building a bridge between our present system of control and the system that we would like to achieve through the reform.
That is the proposal before us.
Only if they are able to do so will we revert to sampling, to selecting, which is often controlled.
Therefore, we are all aware that, in practice, this is certainly not a simple undertaking.
Of course I also think that we are not in a position, either as politicians or as technicians, to tackle this problem on our own.
Fortunately, however, the vast majority of children and young people grow up in an environment free of all these types of problem.
I entirely agree with the President of the Commission about the need to prepare such a list along the lines of a constitution, and I am quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforced and that the EU must therefore refrain from making policy on the wide range of areas in which the political problems are not of a cross-border nature.
Information from all over the world and from every sphere of knowledge is delivered to the home in record time and our children can communicate all around the world on an everyday basis.
Arrested very soon afterwards, they told the police, "It' s funny, they don' t get caught that easily on the telly.
Legislators - and I have almost finished speaking now - cannot regulate everything, but they must occasionally remind everyone what their rights and duties are.
I am also very aware of the remarks made about education, about training in the interpretation of images and about making younger people more aware of the need to approach the media in a critical frame of mind and not to watch any old thing, at any time and in any way.
Nothing will be more damaging to their developing views, than if a report such as this fails to make progress or if it fails to deliver greater mobility or if it fails to at least start to demolish the barriers that confront educational mobility today.
The problems to be resolved vary from country to country: for example, regulations differ on matters of social security, study grants, right of residence and taxation, and there is no system for the mutual recognition of qualifications and work placements.
It is about time that Europe turned its attention once more to the sound implementation of programmes such as Socrates and Youth for Europe.
When it comes to student and teacher mobility, experience shows that the real problems of mobility are not found so much in the area of educational administration, but with the social, tax and immigration authorities.
The SOCRATES Programme was mentioned as one example of this.
There must be clear checks and monitoring, even if only of a sample, and above all, a web site, where students can register their complaints.
We therefore call for research workers to be included in the scope of the recommendations.
It is easy to talk in a speech about removing obstacles, but less easy to remove them in practice.
The debate is closed.
We would like to join with President Chirac and Minister Fischer in saying how much we value this move.
The Union must present a completely united front in matters of foreign policy, defence and common security.
We need a decision-making forum in order to address issues which are of primary importance to both sides of the Mediterranean, such as migration flows, the transfer of the factors of production and energy supply.
The motion for a resolution on the Commission' s reports that you will be voting on later goes into great detail on the subject.
The Finnish Presidency' s report on women and decision-making sets out clear indicators for evaluating the progress made.
In addition to the Ministerial Conference and the Conference on Professional Equality, I should also mention two very important documents specifically devoted to equality, but within the area of competence of the Employment and Social Affairs Council.
The second relates to the principle of non-discrimination, including that based on gender.
In connection with the reports, I would also say - and the President-in-Office of the Council touched upon this, too - that one of the major problems in the EU is of course the big cultural differences.
The reports we are dealing with here seem to reflect this mood.
We must monitor whether the directive on equality is really being incorporated into legislation.
I believe that this method, which Finland has introduced for the first time, works well in many areas and while it is part of the Commission' s strategy on equality there is good reason to expect much from it.
In the name of equal opportunities, and thanks to Europe, French women have won the right to work at night.
As a French woman and citizen, this vision of the world is particularly alien to me.
In spite of these remarks, we shall vote for this report because we are naturally in favour of equal opportunities, but what equal opportunities means most of all is respect for everyone.
Whoever denies mothers the freedom of choice to bring up their own children unpaid, will be presented with the bill later on in the form of youth crime and vandalism.
I would remind you, in this connection, of our report on the splitting of pension rights in the event of divorce, as a result of which, payments for surviving relatives and the retirement age are to be included in the 1979 directive.
The Polish women were very grateful to us for making it clear that the representative who was there at the time most definitely did not reflect the views of Polish women.
Greater involvement by women at all levels of government and in all areas of life is essential for deepening democracy and achieving and maintaining peace.
My final comment concerns the situation of women in the countries preparing to join the European Union.
In this area therefore, the Council, especially its men, has a tremendously important job to do in leading Europe in the fight against the Mafia that trades in women, for this slave trade is not something that responsible politicians can push aside, shrug off or ignore.
From the reports and speeches that we are considering today we can deduce, as many of us already knew, that the problem of equal opportunities is a structural problem and that in order to deal with it we need global strategies, because as women we are not a category or a homogenous social group or indeed any sort of group.
I was indeed sorry to see that Maria De Belém Roseira was no longer the representative.
Two of you mentioned new social rights, new fiscal rights.
Thirdly, because they form the basis for strategy, both for the European Union - even in the Charter of Fundamental Rights the fact that we had a picture of the current situation played an important role - and at national level, given that the Member States are able to use the comparative assessment to set national targets.
The joint debate is closed.
These amendments need to be considered in the new context of the interinstitutional agreement, and therefore, Parliament can agree to not insisting on these commitology amendments given that they have been superseded to a certain extent by the new interinstitutional framework.
I personally continue to believe, however, that the text that was adopted by Parliament at the time responded much better to the new realities that had arisen from the internal market and the liberalisation of the markets, insofar as the elements of clarification and monitoring that were introduced by the amendments that were not adopted were a better guarantee that the rules would be complied with and that the same procedures would be followed when applying them.
If we want third countries to accept commitments, the European Community must be the most zealous in ensuring that its own rules are being complied with, because if a country has the opportunity to place products in the Community by means of smuggling, why is it going to bother to negotiate with us for any sort of concessions?
In the same way, the amendment tabled by Parliament regarding paperless declarations, adopted by the Council, will enable Member State customs authorities to have state-of-the-art automated administration equipment at their disposal.
But it is too late now because you have just taken the vote and Members voted in favour of it.
Vote (continuation)
Report (A5-0198/2000) by Mrs Dybkjær, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on the Commission annual reports "Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union - 1997, 1998, 1999 (COM(1998) 302 - C5­0106/1999) (COM(1999) 106 - C5-0289/2000) (COM(2000) 123 - C5- 0290/2000 -1999/2109(COS))
This is not the first time I have expressed my views on mobility for students and teachers.
This report is all the more important because it comes at a critical time for the European Union, a time of enlargement.
Discrimination cannot be tackled by creating additional administrative bodies; but solely by changing people' s attitudes.
I have not voted for the Mann report because, while it is indeed necessary to seek equal treatment for people in employment and occupation, it is also necessary to refrain from pushing zeal to the point of abandoning all protection of freedoms and all respect for the rule of law.
As a confirmed secularist, I cannot associate myself with that.
The SNP welcomes this directive and its aim to end discrimination in the workplace.
If the directive is to be adopted and implemented, it must not be encumbered with a literary approach and wishful thinking, which have no place in a legal document.
However the EPLP has strong reservations about the following areas.
There are also elements which, we feel, should be left to Member States such as overall implementation, provision of training to particular age groups of workers, the nature of a mediation system, and how SMEs are to interpret the directive.
In the interview, Mr Van Hulten is right in saying that we will not be able to draft a positive agenda until we have solved problems such as fraud, waste, but also a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making.
The reasons of my vote on this report relate, in the main, to the question of closer European Union relations with NATO and also the onward rush to a common defence policy.
Moreover, the report discusses European arms exports as a way of solving future local conflicts in the immediate vicinity of Europe.
However, I cannot accept the introduction of the requirement of a common defence policy and a European security and defence policy within NATO.
Children are the first victims of violence on television.
I am delighted this study has been completed.
A committee of experts will also be constituted at a European Community level with the mandate of drawing up a memorandum setting out general principles for the protection of minors in the media context.
Report Dybkjær (A5-0198/2000)
Interestingly, this is the first time that the need for the Commission' s annual reports to go further in its evaluation of the efficacy of political initiatives has been identified.
Peru
Mr President, Peru is currently going through a period of uncertainty, and we all cherish the hope that the current situation will be resolved through a process in which all civil and political rights are guaranteed, which will help to strengthen and consolidate democracy and peace in Peru, a country that has suffered 25 000 deaths in the last fifteen years.
The term in question is the word 'democracy'.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the conditions under which elections were held in Peru in May this year, were unacceptable.
B5-0793/2000, by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the position of women in Afghanistan.
I therefore also think it good that the decision should include some clear and explicit points about the position of women in particular and should draw attention to how necessary it is for us to try to help prevent the Taliban regime from continuing with its wholesale discrimination against women.
The EU has an important task before it in this respect.
There can be no recognition by any Member State, as long as Afghanistan maintains its policy of violation of human rights, notably its systematic discrimination against women.
And we do need to take this into account in the European institutions, as well as the fact that drug cultivation is used to buy arms.
That said, it will give staunch support to the neighbouring countries, so as to improve their chances of tackling the drugs problem.
I think this is a good time to highlight the need for the European Union to draw up a comprehensive policy on Latin America which could perhaps prevent these countries from regularly going through the crisis situations that some of them have experienced.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, in common with Parliament, welcomes the release of the Spanish Jesuit priest, Alejandro Matos Castro, last week.
B5-0782/2000, by Mr Haarbyr, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Macedonia: law on higher education and universities;
Therefore, we are all delighted that a genuinely sound solution is perhaps at last to be found to this problem of higher education.
As far as I am concerned, it proves to all neighbouring countries that education does not only have to spread hatred, as is often the case these days, but that it can also serve as a cradle for a peaceful, multi-ethnic society.
I would have preferred it if we could have found a solution that all the parties in Parliament could have voted for.
Perhaps I could use this opportunity to say that the cooperation between the Commission and the High Commissioner, Mr van der Stoel, has already got off to a good start.
We are not debating here merely in order to express our sorrow; the main subject of our debate is what happened, why it happened and how we can rectify the situation, how the Commission and the European Parliament can help from now on to ensure that the same does not happen again in the future.
Be that as it may, Mr President, we have agreed to this joint proposal for a resolution, which we support as it stands, urgently, and we of course disagree with the amendments tabled, again urgently, for the reasons which I have stated.
As far as my amendment on working conditions is concerned, there is a directive on this and the wording of the amendment is less satisfactory than the text.
It is simply not acceptable to the northern and western isles of Scotland, nor for the potential North Sea to European mainland crossing which I hope will be established in the not-too-distant future.
I am pleased that the Greek government has now nullified this exemption.
The Commission therefore contacted the Greek authorities as soon as the Express Samina went down, requesting clarification of the application of Community law.
The question which I wish to raise and which I would ask the Bureau to clarify is if, having done away with Fridays, certain parties are now trying to do away with Thursdays.
I would also like to tell you that the European Union has put mechanisms in place so that, once the popular will of the Serbian people is respected, that is, once we have a government that is supported by the people who voted in the ballot boxes for Mr Kostunica, we can offer two things: firstly, an immediate lifting of sanctions and secondly, a package of economic aid that can help the Serbian people to rebuild their economy.
The question of whether democratic change can now be introduced and if it can be introduced without violence will perhaps be decided in the next few hours on the streets of Belgrade.
We condemn any action which deserves to be seen as provocation, especially in connection with the holy sites in Jerusalem.
And we have to offer them our hand in a very symbolic way - as Mr Solana said - with this meeting in Zagreb.
These are bullets which, upon contact with the body, shatter into dozens of pieces. They are banned internationally, even in battles amongst soldiers; yet they are now used against citizens.
In my opinion, Europe can and must do a great deal in this direction, and it must be clear and resolute.
So we must do everything possible to douse the fire as quickly as possible.
Provocations such as those initiated by Mr Ariel Sharon, must be refrained from.
That is happening again today, and that is what will prevent, and has prevented Europe from acting as mediator in the Middle East all these years, leaving the United States to fulfil that role alone.
We shall not sacrifice the Serbian people to our noble and moral objectives, because that would mean that perhaps thousands of people in Serbia and Yugoslavia might die for them.
Finally, I would like to propose that a delegation from Parliament visit Serbia at the earliest opportunity, and once a new Yugoslavian government has been installed, so that we, in tandem with this new government, can make plans for the reconstruction of a new Serbia.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that today may well turn out to be a historic day in this Parliament, possibly ushering in the end of one of the last buttresses of a totalitarian dictatorship in Europe.
Mr President, there is a problem with the German urgent debate file - I do not know if the same applies to the other language versions - in that it only contains the proposed amendments of the GUE group but none of the motions for resolutions and not even the joint text.
Mr President, I just wanted to draw attention to the huge pile of documents we needed for voting this week.
If Parliament could table amendments to the Council Decision it would certainly remind us of Croatia' s unemployment and social problems, which are the result of that country being put on a slimming regimen, but there is no legal basis here for such amendments.
It is time to call for the same objectives with regard to the activities of the EIB.
Mr President, last night we discussed the topic of Serbia and the revolutionary changes that are taking place there.
I would therefore urge the fellow Members but also, and mainly, the Council, to stick as closely as possible to the Commission' s proposal during the next couple of months of negotiations on the budget for next year and subsequent years, the reason being that, in my view, the proposal still provides the best estimate of the total cost in Croatia, but also in other parts of the Balkans.
Democratic elections were held there in 1990, which the international community deemed fair and free.
I therefore say 'yes' to financial aid, and 'yes' to this guarantee, but, at the same time, would call upon the Commission most emphatically to lend massive support to this deeply European, and now truly democratic and constitutionally governed country, and to include it in the list of candidate countries, because I believe Croatia has earned our full support.
Along with the rapporteur, I do wonder whether the funds will be made available in real terms, especially now it appears that Serbia will also be needing large funds shortly and the Union' s budget is not being increased.
The delegations from the Croatian Parliament and from our own, have also called upon the Council to extend the EIB mandate.
I hope that negotiations will soon get underway and, as with Croatia, that aid will also be granted to the Serbian people, who deserve our greatest respect.
(The Minutes were approved)
We will make an appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday and collect the names and signatures of those women who wish to be part of the delegation. Our intention is to build bridges of peace between women in places where violence prevails.
All in all there has been more suffering for Basques and Spaniards; certainly the Spaniards and Basques are fed up with the present conflict.
Madam President, you will recall that at the last part-session I raised the plight of the British democracy campaigner, James Mawdsley, who was held illegally by the Burmese authorities.
Madam President, I have a genuine point of order.
The fact is, this apparently technical report, which does not seem to make any great changes of a political nature, is extremely important insofar as it introduces the possibility of carrying out genetic engineering in viticulture and hence ending up with genetically modified viticulture.
Not voting on the report will lead to delays.
As you said, the Council of State rejected the appeal and we were duly informed of that rejection.
However, the incident has been repeated again, and this time, although the Member concerned is a member of the European People' s Party, he is not from the same political party or persuasion as I am in Italy.
Hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard, similar to the one already in use in the internal market, which details specific measures, expiry dates and deadlines.
I hope, Minister, that the Council will be inspired by Parliament' s expectations, and I hope that you will succeed in setting ambitious goals at the Nice Summit for a European social agenda, which we can work towards together over the next couple of years.
Following the informal Employment and Social Policy Council on 8 July this year in Paris, the Presidency invited all the parties involved, the European Parliament, of course, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, both sides of industry, NGOs, Council groups and committees, to submit their proposals.
It is a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality, and Lisbon clearly established a twofold objective: more jobs and better jobs.
Freedom of movement must be encouraged, while ensuring that career paths are safeguarded.
We need to try to list and identify the gaps left in the system, and at least put them on the agenda.
In our view, open coordination is the correct route to go down if we are to secure a social Europe.
Implementing the ambitions for society declared in Lisbon calls for an effort on the part of the Community, an action plan to create jobs in services, especially those related to the information society.
The Commission can obviously make an important contribution, but the social problems have their roots in local conditions and must be handled with great sensitivity for the practical conditions concerned.
Social policy served to mitigate the most damaging effects of economic policies.
The original Commission proposal was much better left unamended - congratulations Commissioner.
It is an ambitious agenda, and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that was made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection.
I also think that it will be very positive in terms of helping women to reconcile family and working life.
It sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection.
What are the basic strands which make up the content?
It is still hard for us to define European objectives which are equally valid for all the Member States because the situation on the ground varies.
The Committee has submitted 49 amendments.
One amendment is to the effect that it should be possible to hold an annual debate here in Parliament, together with the Commission.
Furthermore, the Community must do more in the way of assessing the need for additional initiatives, including, where necessary, implementing legislation and equal opportunities, and fighting discrimination.
There has not been a shortage of good ideas or good plans to achieve equality in the past but their implementation has often failed.
It is not right for a handful of women, expert in making claims of society and living on intravenous injections of public monies, to monopolise the role of speaking on behalf of women.
Equality between women and men in civil life, allowing women to fully enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms.
I am expecting the male protagonists to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherited notions of gender roles and stereotypes.
In any case, I feel that we should thank her for following the debate, especially since she was not scheduled to be present during this discussion as well.
Competition policy
We owe it to our companies to offer them the best conditions so that they are able to plan their production and, especially, their future.
They must have a wide variety of high-quality, competitively priced goods and that, ultimately, is the reason for pushing forward with the single market and, along with it, free competition, because it is to the benefit of all our citizens.
It concerns the subsidisation decision or non-subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry.
Paragraph 16 of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s report talks of increased legal certainty where applications for mergers are concerned, together with more effective and shorter timeframes within which to appeal before courts.
In all cases, these are public companies whose financial prowess derives from their past and present positions of monopoly rather than managerial expertise.
We need to promote the citizens' awareness of competition policy, so that they recognise the advantages.
They are especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment, and I hope that in future this can be made clear, so that these aids, these internal aids, which affect regional development and the regional economy, in which transport aid is a key example, might continue.
This statement contains three important messages.
A big thank you to Mr Evans as well, for his excellent report on the rules governing State aid to the steel industry and on the eighth survey on State aid in the European Union.
I would therefore like to assure Mrs Palacio, Mr Karas and the other Members who spoke on these points that the regulation takes their concerns into ample consideration.
Otherwise we would be serving our purpose of helping competition and the consumers in a perverse way.
The debate is closed.
The financial mechanism implements Article 119 of the EC Treaty, which only remains in force during the third stage of economic and monetary union for the Member States which are not participating in monetary union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the fact that we are, after all, to have the opportunity to discuss the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine, and I also hope that tomorrow' s vote will have a positive outcome.
On 5 July, some of these issued the Beaune declaration, expressing their great concern at the introduction of GMOs into their sector.
The regulations proposed by the directive, moreover, favour the production of diversified plant material by offering the best health guarantees, which is a basic requirement, in order to effectively support the restructuring of the Community vineyard sector, which is a key point in the new COM in wine-growing.
It must be said loud and clear, there was absolutely no need to stuff the articles of this directive with references to directive 90/220, which is currently being revised, unless the intention was to promote genetic manipulation in vines at all costs.
I am happy to be able to inform you that we can also accept Amendments Nos 35 to 40, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, which are intended to reinforce the transposal of the safety and management requirements according to directive 90/220.
I would simply like to point out that Parliament was not in itself called upon to give an opinion.
Madam President, I speak with regard to Item 14 of the Minutes on the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity.
Let me expand on the issue of qualified majority voting.
Concerning the weighting of votes, the two well-known systems also remain on the table: a simple re-weighting, in favour of which a narrow, very narrow majority is emerging, or a double majority system, but with alternative options, a double simple or double re-weighted majority, in other words a type of 'demographic safety net' .
Moreover, without prejudice to a needs assessment and the coordination of economic and financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which are to be the joint responsibility of the European Commission and the World Bank, the Biarritz European Council decided to grant the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia initial emergency humanitarian aid totalling EUR 200 million.
But if I had to tell you spontaneously and very sincerely how I felt, I would say this: regardless of the sensitivity of these issues - the composition of the Commission and the voting system - they cannot be used as criteria for assessing whether Nice is a success or a failure.
Also to be welcomed was the fact that the Heads of State and Government assented to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but I must also ask you to consider, Mr President-in-Office, how it was possible to achieve this.
We must not kill the spirit of Nice with boredom, and we therefore have an essential priority in the remaining 50 days: to bring negotiations to a political level.
In this respect I would also like to address my colleagues in the European People' s Party - and I would ask Mr Poettering to listen to me - because what we advocate in this Assembly, we should also advocate outside it.
From what we know of the performance of the Prime Ministers and Presidents at Biarritz on the trickiest questions of Treaty reform, the Charter will probably become the greatest trophy at Nice.
The Council would truly satisfy the expectations of European citizens if it were to launch a widespread consultation of individual communities and national parliaments, culminating in a charter that genuinely met people' s needs.
We must therefore urge everyone to return to the roots of our Union, to have the courage that Giscard d' Estaing and Helmut Schmidt showed when deciding on the election of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage in 1976 and in 1979, and to decide that in 2009 we will finally have a President of the Commission who is also the President of the European Union.
In this respect I would like to respond to what Mr Poettering has said about the rift between the larger and smaller states.
I would like to briefly return to matters of external trade policy, as this is a very serious matter.
That really is something valuable, as was emphasised by all the members of the European Council.
A second very positive thing was the adoption of the Charter in its entirety.
Beyond this, it would seem to me that the Biarritz Council scored several points on this issue, which is crucial to the future of the European Union and its decision-making procedures, and we can only welcome that.
I hope we can still convince people of this and make progress, in order to win the day on this issue at Nice.
I can cite two practical examples: on the one hand we shifted the emphasis from the right to work to the right to engage in work and, on the other hand, a number of social rights that are covered in the revised Social Charter of the Council of Europe are not included in the Charter.
It is clear from the debates that have been taking place across Europe, including those in Biarritz, that larger Member States are seeking, in part, to bully smaller Member States to reform the European Union in line with the direction taken by larger Member States and in accordance with their wishes.
The negotiators see the fact that there are malcontents on both sides as proof that they are on the way to striking the right balance.
The leaders of Europe have not formulated a clear vision.
It would be short-sighted to envisage a Commission structured according to criteria based on the representation of the individual States.
A Union of this kind would be centralised in character and give the small countries less influence than that which the United States' s two-chamber system gives to small federal states.
Following the summit meeting in Sharm-el-Sheikh where all parties involved were present in order to find a way to freeze the violence and to re-open the dialogue between Barak and Arafat, we established that it is very difficult - even if, for a fleeting moment, it seemed as if it were possible - to halt the violence.
Clearly, Mr Barón Crespo has been misinformed regarding Italy and my party.
It is important to take a step forward on the European energy taxation front, such progress having been blocked hitherto by the unanimity principle.
We must not allow things to reach a point where the smaller States fear that there might be recourse to solutions by decree.
In my opinion, the Convention did sterling work and I am proud to have been part of this Convention.
In the latter case, the question we must answer is when will this principle of a rotation which treats both larger and smaller states on a strictly equal basis come into effect.
The extension of qualified majority voting and codecision to real issues, the preservation of Article 250 in its current form, the place and role of the Commission in closer cooperation, in respect of more than just the first pillar: these are some of the factors that will allow us see straight away whether we are talking of success or failure.
Mr President, first of all, I wish to thank Jacques, Jacques Delors, and also Altiero Spinelli and Fernand Herman, I wish to thank everyone, from Vaclav Havel to Carlo Ciampi, from Joschka Fischer to Jacques Chirac, from Michel Barnier to Pierre Moscovici, from Chris Patten to Costa Simitis, not to mention Florence and the plethora of current Members of the European Parliament who, since 1999, have carried forward the great movement in favour of an European constitution.
Let us not criticise commercial Europe too much, I speak as a Socialist: it provides greater wealth to all of us.
Let us at least agree on this objective, and if we do agree, then let us state how to achieve it.
Mr President, I have had the satisfaction of noting that the proposals presented recently at the Intergovernmental Conference coincide in the main with all or some of the criteria I have set out.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen of the House, you wanted us to have a debate, this morning, on those issues regarding which this House thought it necessary to add to the opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference that was issued in April.
And so, while respecting the existing constitutional framework, I must say I think it would be difficult to envisage more than a procedure for an advisory opinion from Parliament when such measures are adopted.
As you know full well, that presupposes our taking certain political decisions, with a scope that goes much farther than meeting the three requirements which I have just mentioned.
I myself stressed that the method adopted for the Charter was an avenue worth exploring.
But I understand that, behind the linguistic aspect, your question expresses another concern.
So that is also why I wished to thank you, as well as to thank you for the form and the content of the initiative you have taken.
The implementation of reinforced cooperation must not result in new bodies being set up to swell the ranks of the European institutions.
It is time to review the Treaties.
The European Council is violating this fundamental consensus within Europe, by refusing to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, make it legally binding and denying the citizens, whose rights are being infringed, access to the European Court of Justice.
Should we do otherwise, then I do not think a Europe of the citizens will be within our reach.
Paragraph 8 states that the constitution will deal with, and I quote, the "issues not settled" .
No one has been able to explain to me yet why things are any different now.
Second, with regard to an inadequate agenda, which has left out issues that are particularly relevant to the future of the European Union and its citizens' interests.
Minister, it is recorded that on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution - an event that was to have such desperate consequences throughout the world - the Russian Orthodox Church was engaged in complex discussions on the design of vestments during Lent.
Cooperation must therefore offer all the guarantees proposed by the rapporteur, be open to all the Member States, respect the spirit of the Treaties and not undermine the acquis communautaire.
At the same time, there is one point I would like to highlight. I do not think it is right that we should call for or move towards the requirement for a compulsory referendum in every Member State to approve the specific amendments that have been proposed.
We have had an in-depth debate on two issues which, although different, converge at one point.
We are ready to ensure that it can be put to the vote during the November part-session so that it may, in that way, also be possible for it to be adopted during the French Presidency.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
What is the meaning of "the introduction of the opportunity to move towards retirement gradually, via part-time work" , if not a threat to the age of retirement, which is already far too high in many countries?
As you know, pensioners, like children, love eating jam.
I asked the pensioners who sent me here to the European Parliament to represent the Pensioners' Party whether they would like to drink genetically modified wine.
Or even, by way of derogation, for standard material for vegetative propagation to be supplied when demand cannot be met from other categories.
I therefore put it to you, Mr President: are not such discrepancies in contributions also a restriction upon free competition in the European Union?
We therefore felt bound to vote against the report, which is what we did.
Notwithstanding the move towards greater deregulation within the European Union, state aids can still play a constructive role in achieving social and economic progress.
That aid could well be indispensable to the protection of the environment and public services and to guaranteeing equal income levels for people living in economically disadvantaged regions.
There is a danger, once the EU is safely in control of large state aid, of its turning its attention to small-scale aid on the pretext of the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Section VI, Economic and Social Committee;
If you look at the budgetary implementation schedules for headings 2, 3, 4 and 7, then you will note that only an average 8% of all commitments are covered by payments.
Three years ago, we launched our employment initiative, which involved helping small and medium-sized enterprises to acquire risk-bearing capital.
Parliament' s preferred approach is twofold.
Only then will the European institutions do justice to their task.
I would like to take this opportunity to expressly thank the Vice-President, Mr Gerhard Schmid, who is responsible for budgetary issues, for his constructive cooperation.
We want this committee to retain its viability, but it pays the least attention to Parliament' s demands as part of the budgetary authority. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue.
In other words, the year 2001 will see the last full annual budget, and will also form the background to the assessment of the Commission proposal and the proposal that we are in the process of submitting to Parliament.
In addition, we want there to be a review of the administrative expenditure.
Since 1985 - and I did say 1985 - the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets has been trying to ensure that European Parliament procedures take account of the financial impact of the resolutions voted upon in plenary.
I shall end, Mr President, by thanking the other institutions for their diligence in the handling of this joint declaration.
You are called on today to decide on a budget that has already been amended at first reading by the Council.
Concerning structural operations, overall, the amount set aside for these in the 2000 budget has been maintained.
The Council is taking a calm approach to the revision of the financial perspective.
If you look at these three different sets of figures, you will see that there are still considerable discrepancies, in purely quantitative terms but obviously as regards content too.
I would point out at this juncture that following a long debate last year, a new decision was taken on the comitology procedure, in conjunction with the Council, and I hold out little hope of us being able to reopen this debate.
EUR 8.1 billion were earmarked for the MEDA programme in the Berlin financial planning.
I should therefore ask both the Council and the Committee on Budgets here in Parliament to think in terms of foreign policy and not only in terms of budget strategy when they concern themselves with foreign policy.
The second is for aid to victims of human rights violations in need of treatment in specialised institutions.
Should a compromise solution be reached on this issue in the time remaining, which supports the important work undertaken by the EMAC Committee, then we can arrange things accordingly, otherwise our committee will keep an open mind on the matter.
We only have to look at our television sets to see the difficulties in the Middle East to be reminded of that each and every day.
And so I hope that when it comes to tomorrow' s vote, we will still achieve the majority required for the observation point in Dublin
Mr President, on behalf of my Committee, I would like to make a few observations, starting with rural policy.
We have asked an indicative appropriation of EUR 2 million to be approved for an information campaign on the CFP.
The Commission in its executive capacity must negotiate with weighty arguments to achieve a reasonable agreement with Morocco and the Council and the governments concerned should provide a political impetus for this negotiation.
Today, we are viewing the 2001 budget with the Serbian population very much at the forefront of our minds.
All in all, we would like to see these amendments approved.
An important way that the citizens can ensure that their concerns are addressed is by appealing either to the Ombudsman or petitioning Parliament.
I turn first to Parliament' s budget.
To the surprise of many in my delegation, we established a core strategy unanimously at the beginning of September and the 400 amendments introduced by some of my colleagues came as somewhat of a surprise to many of us in the Budget Committee.
It is difficult to see how more posts will solve the problem of management if there are still antiquated and complex procedures both in the Commission and Council for dealing with the many programmes.
Parliament has demonstrated repeatedly over the past few years that extreme financial prudence is the bedrock of our work.
We cannot have a situation where we talk in a very relaxed manner about commitments over the years, and repeatedly make these promises, but then, when it comes to paying up, say that we are now unable to afford it and will have to cut back a bit in this area!
If we only include a few million in the lines - that is about all we can manage - it is just a stalling tactic, because when the people actually come to need it, we withdraw it again.
Like the budget before it, Budget 2001 had almost insoluble conflicts to contend with: on the one hand the pressure of consolidation and cost-cutting policy, as agreed under the Interinstitutional Agreement, in order to secure the financing of the enlargement process, and on the other hand, the acute financing needs of the Stability Pact for the Balkans.
Demands for improved performance also imply a need for more staff.
Had this amendment been adopted in its initial version, it might have started to deal the cards afresh, but the idea was rejected by the majority of the Committee on Budgets.
But in that case, unfortunately, there are many examples: special treatment given to associations with declared federalist aims or to the many NGOs whose roles, philosophies and operations are highly questionable, the funding of European political parties, via the sums swallowed up in the Prince programme, in an attempt to convince the citizens of Member States of the validity of the euro at a time when the European currency is experiencing a loss of confidence widely shared by Europeans, from our Danish friends right up to the managers of the European Central Bank.
Finally, Mr Heaton-Harris was right to refer in his amendments to the onesidedness of many European programmes, in which the citizen is treated to a propaganda-like tale on European integration, and at the expense of the citizens themselves would you believe.
In addition, our administrative systems must be modernised, and it is our duty to lead by example.
The MEDA programme, which focuses on the Mediterranean basin, a geographical area of the utmost strategic importance, is a good example of our inability to implement our programmes.
When people talk about making reductions or finding the money within category 4 to fund certain priorities, do not forget that Parliament has its priorities, We made that clear in the vote in committee.
So that figure will need to be clarified.
Thank you very much, Mr Wynn.
All it means is that there is a certain flexibility to enable specific policies to go ahead, even if some countries cannot, or do not wish to, participate, and what is true for the European Union' s Member States is also true for the candidate countries.
I think Austria has no call for complaint regarding what has been done, quite the contrary.
Recommendations from regional organisations and the experience of neighbouring countries will doubtless be able to assist in defining these means.
In 1984, 0.2% of landowners in Colombia owned 32% of the land.
The Council is not here to make comments on every aspect of this extremely sensitive and painful issue.
At the same time, it is just not possible to undertake an ad hoc debate on matters like this, which are, let me repeat, extremely complex ones.
Question No 10 by (H-0722/00):
I shall therefore beware of giving a definitive answer to this difficult question.
It is just that we get the impression, and your answer testifies to this somewhat, that the Council Presidency is not being very proactive in dealing with this issue.
So, clearly, the revenue from this levy will not be zero.
I also excuse them, but we shall apply the Rules of Procedure.
The reason why we have been quiet here on the right is therefore that we have already examined these matters once and, in our opinion, we do not need to talk about the same issues over and over again in this Chamber and use up our precious time doing so.
Moreover, in anticipation of adopting this directive on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a decision on the prohibition of the use of material presenting risks as regards these diseases was taken in June 2000, in order to stop any further spreading of the epidemic and in order to guarantee the highest possible health protection standards for the consumer.
I do not have any information other than that I have already given you.
We monitor, and we are familiar with, the work done by the Commission and the Council on the Erika 1 package, but regarding this strait, which is notorious in the two countries concerned and within the European Union as a particularly tricky passage, one often used by large vessels in order to gain just a few hours at the risk of some old tub' s running aground and causing a disaster, I should like to know, and more especially the inhabitants of Corsica and Sardinia would like to know, if it will be at all possible, and if you have any such plans, to issue a ban, pure and simple, on large vessels, containers, using the Strait of Bonifacio.
I therefore believe that, in principle, we ought to support the Commission proposals for revising their staffing policy.
New money is needed in the budget for Serbia and Kosovo.
I hope, Mr President, and this is my concluding remark, that we are at least going to cut the EUR 50 million budget lines financing the Israel-PLO peace agreement.
Therefore, in the European Parliament, we will propose new measures, not so much aimed at seeking new funding - which we already know cannot be implemented under current conditions - but at establishing new institutional commitments that will improve the quality of spending and ensure that not a single euro is wasted.
Consider the fact that, in European policy, as in any other field, sometimes the moderate options cease to be the majority options.
It is designed to obscure rather than enlighten and I have been disappointed by the attitude adopted today with respect to activity-based budgeting.
When, however, expenses are allocated according to activity, this also paves the way for the Budget' s being seen more in terms of a political tool, in which the distribution of expenditure reflects clear political priorities.
So let us therefore find a solution which will last for several years so that, next year and the year after that too, we do not have to go through this discussion as to how we are to find money for reconstruction in the Balkans.
Those with an interest in developing a sustainable agricultural sector will be aware that the central thrust of recent reform as agreed in Berlin is a continuing move from commodity support to direct income support for farmers.
A budget is always more than a mere juggling with figures.
In the final analysis, it is immoral to cut spending on agricultural policy, on the MEDA programme and on the socially excluded, in order to find the resources to finance the European Union' s commitments in Kosovo and Yugoslavia.
To put it simply: the people of Serbia ought neither to freeze nor to go hungry this winter.
I would also like to express my concern about the fact that the various Youth Parliaments have been included in the Socrates programme.
It must also, of course, be made clear to the Council that it also has its share of responsibility for the deficiencies in the way that many external programmes have been handled.
A stable solution is now required when it comes to these contributions and, to a still greater degree, to the long-term planning for the whole of the Western Balkans which is now necessary.
I believe that most people are prepared to accept this, on the understanding that the money is used in the right way.
I share the concerns and opinions that the rapporteur, Mrs Rühle, mentioned this afternoon regarding the sections on research and social measures.
Two weeks ago we had the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
At the same time, budget funds from the Research and Information Fund ought to be made available for the purpose of researching into alternative forms of production for farmers who at present cultivate tobacco, and this is something we want to see happen.
I want to make it very clear that the European Union, insofar as Northern Ireland is concerned, has had the most direct and positive influence imaginable.
In this model, respect for standards and procedures is guaranteed by an independent authority and final jurisdiction lies with the judges.
Thus, for the first time, codecision will apply at the first reading to an extremely complex text which is full of technical difficulties on the particularly sensitive sector of the protection of civil liberties.
The fact that their tasks have not been combined is extremely positive.
Are you aware, for instance, that the Schengen system has amassed over ten million files on almost one and a half million citizens, and that Europol, whose sphere of competence is being incessantly expanded, has a central database of information from the various police forces of the fifteen Member States, all this supervised only by an authority with neither the powers nor the resources available to it to enable it to carry out another task properly.
Having said that, I would like to take advantage of the fact that the Commissioner is here to say that it would appear appropriate to concern ourselves not only with protecting citizens in respect of new technologies but also with the use of these technologies to increase the European citizens' means of intervening and interacting with the European institutions.
Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4 to 10, 12 to 40, 42 to 54, 57, 58 and 60 to 64 reflect the Council text on the points to which the Commission can give its assent.
It goes without saying, then, that his opinion on the legislative proposals to do with the protection of personal data will be very valuable insofar as it will be a major contribution to the legislative debate between institutions.
The Treaty recognises that the outermost regions have a difficult economic and social situation, aggravated by special handicaps which, because they are continual and combined, are extremely prejudicial to development in these regions.
In this way it will contribute to promoting economic and social progress thanks to an increased level of employment.
I therefore congratulate Mrs Sudre, and we wait with great interest for the Commission' s proposals to be developed into rules, so that the specific characteristics can soon be taken into account, as established in paragraph 2 of Article 299 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
For many Europeans, some outermost regions are nothing more than a holiday destination on the map.
Our unemployment levels are among the highest in the European Union.
I am pleased to see that the committee has adopted the bulk of the amendment I tabled.
In my opinion, it is very important that the outermost regions are integrated into the trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks.
The unanimous approval by the members of the Committee on Regional Policy of the report presented by Mrs Sudre demonstrates the European Parliament' s adherence to one of its most important commitments.
We cannot debate a whole series of circumstances and imagine that, once that ideal and idyllic point, let us call it, has been reached, it will no longer be necessary to adopt more measures for the treatment of these three areas and particularly of the outermost regions that we are discussing today.
This article, ladies and gentlemen, although it does not enable us to do everything, at least allows us to step up or action, and I believe it is necessary to expand and improve our schemes.
In terms of drawing up the necessary proposals, the Commission is, obviously, working in collaboration with the Member States and regions concerned.
In these regions, as we know, there are long-term problems and I therefore believe that, objectively, in accordance with their actual level of development, they need long-term support from regional policy and special measures.
It would again be possible to organise a meeting of this kind in 2001, by which time we shall have made more progress in carrying out the programme presented in March.
The Presidency declared that closed and I fully accept that.
I believe it is as well for Parliament to keep to the current Rules because, as another Member rightly said, very often it is not the machines that did not work but the Members that forgot to vote; if we were able to correct a vote after the event, we would never see the end of it.
I am clearly what I eat.
All in all, Commissioner, along with the authority, the relevant Commission services must, in collaboration and coordination with the Member States, establish a system of efficient, standardised controls throughout the food chain, and the network of food laboratories in the European Union must be improved and their work coordinated with the Commission.
As duplication of the work and of scientific research must be avoided, we need to collaborate with national research institutes and the joint research centres.
Today we are discussing a White Paper and it is useful to define a few first principles.
Those procedures have now been amended and changed and we have our own Food Standards Agency.
Finally, we will also be supporting a number of the new amendments, certainly Amendments Nos 11-13, 7-9 and we wish to have a free vote on Amendment No 14.
It is against this background that I would first of all like to say that food safety guarantees hinge on strict inspections organised by the state, and those inspections are only as strong as the weakest link.
The subject which we are debating clearly illustrates just how superficial and empty our debate on the political unification of Europe is.
So let us entrust the European Food Safety Agency only with conducting scientific risk analysis, in liaison with our national agencies.
If one charts the progress of the main food-borne diseases which currently affect Europe, most actually made their first appearance in the Americas.
However, the conditions for appealing to the Agency must be drawn up so that efficient and swift action is guaranteed.
It should also be said, as some of the previous speakers have done, and in particular Mr Whitehead and Mrs Gebhardt, that the White Paper is more than just another set of EU rules and regulations.
Mr President, I feel very pleased today and grateful both towards the Commission, for having embarked upon the work on better food safety, and towards Mr Bowis and the whole of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I think that Amendment No 17 is particularly important, stating that the consumer organisations must be consulted.
A further aspect is the organic revision of the labelling rules for both wholesale and retail selling, which will at last provide the consumer with correct information regarding products' traceability and make it possible to identify where responsibility lies in the event of risk or crises.
In my view, drafting new legislation is not the right response to non-compliance with existing legislation.
With the vote in the Committee on the Environment, we have succeeded in re-establishing a certain balance, including in the scope of the resolution nutrition issues and certain significant references to the role of small and medium-sized businesses in safeguarding diverse dietary habits.
Mr President, I would like to join with other colleagues in complimenting the rapporteur, Mr Bowis for his very constructive and very logical approach to this particular problem.
Mr President, the fact that the White Paper on food safety has no intrinsic legislative value does not in any way detract from the dual purpose which it undoubtedly serves.
The rapporteur, along with many MEPs in the Committee, including myself, have placed the focus on the food authority and this is regrettable to some extent.
Self-sufficiency and the independence of the unit will serve the interests of European consumers best.
I have on many an occasion throughout this process thought that we were lucky when we chose him to draw up the report.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on the huge effort which he made in his report to take account of everyone's view and for agreeing that we should also refer to the more general concept of food.
Finally, the European Government should not escape its responsibility.
Most important of all, it should gain the respect of its peers, the confidence of the public and the willingness of Member State governments to accept its conclusions.
That is how I see the future role of a Food Safety Agency.
We have the World Health Organisation in Geneva.
I will not deny that when the White Paper was published, I spoke out against the Agency.
We must therefore ensure that the European Union has the highest possible food safety standards, but in taking this approach - which we unanimously uphold - we must also analyse the economic implications for the sectors involved in production.
The tasks will then involve independent scientific research, advice, independent inspections and a rapid alert system, but definitely coordination too, in order to restore confidence.
As an aside, I can say of the speakers who referred to the need for sensitivity in relation to the promotion of local food specialities and traditional foods that this issue is addressed in the hygiene legislation.
This will facilitate the Commission's task in bringing forward a balanced proposal that takes maximum account of the views of Parliament and the many stakeholders in the area of food safety.
Far from it. In recent years, this issue was one of the driving forces which led to the signing of the Ottawa Convention.
I restate my position opposing Amendments Nos 10 and 19, in the interests of budgetary cohesion and, with regard to Amendment No 29, I call for split voting in order to improve the formulation throughout the text, for I feel that it has suffered from some misinterpretation.
This raises the first question: the need for the European Union, especially the Commission, to do everything possible to encourage non-signatory countries to sign the Ottawa Convention.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know what the consequences of anti-personnel mines are, even if there may often be important military justifications for them in individual cases.
It was Parliament which first raised, in 1996, the issue of a horizontal budget line and of a proper legal base to provide a single platform for the wide range of actions that we undertake in this important field.
But I cannot hide this fact: the Union's powers of persuasion in seeking to achieve this goal are obviously somewhat limited by the remaining difficulties of some Member States in signing and ratifying the Convention.
Mine action is most effective when it is tailored to the conditions which are specific to each situation.
Parliament knows that there are far too many of them already and as the House knows, under our proposals for the reform of EC external assistance, we hope to move away from the heavy handed scrutiny of individual projects and instead focus our discussion with Member States on overall strategies and programming.
NGOs have sprouted up in response to the need and yet, some four years after the first United Nation's landmine conference in Geneva and over a year after the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention, we must recognise that many countries and thousands of people, usually in the poorest regions of the world, are still terribly afflicted by anti-personnel landmines and unexploded munitions.
The Commission needs to improve both the quality of its programmes and their speed of implementation.
I believe, however, that if you were to study them again with more care, you would find that there are a few amendments you quoted which, in my view, concern the awareness campaigns, transparency, access for NGOs, as well as things which are going well at the moment but which could run more efficiently.
Mrs Bonino and Mr Patten are also right to say that Parliament and the Council should not interfere with the administration, and I listened carefully to Mr Patten' s remarks on this point for he obviously thinks we should interfere still less.
Mr President, our group has a history of calling for the entire spectrum of measures and action needed, from suspending production to destroying stocks, stopping trading, clearing mine fields, rehabilitating victims and raising public awareness.
Then it is up to the States to support the process in international fora.
Mines are of course a great obstacle to reconstruction in these countries and to the return of refugees.
At the current de-mining rate it would - as was mentioned earlier - take well over 100 years to clear the planet of anti-personnel landmines.
The third area I have in mind concerns specific measures that ought to be proposed, examined and implemented.
Every child that we can protect from death or terrible injuries because of mines, be it in Bosnia, Africa or elsewhere, makes all our efforts worthwhile.
We must indeed put pressure on those European Union countries that have not signed it, like Finland, or not ratified it, like Greece.
Ladies and gentlemen, just look at Finland.
Lastly, I hope that among the future tasks of the European common military force will be the training of technicians, particularly of people with a local interest in the eradication of landmines.
Nor is emphasis given to the fact that the list of countries most seriously affected mainly comprises developing countries.
Parliament' s proposals could not be more at odds with the aims of Lisbon.
Mrs Van Lancker wants Parliament to decide whether to alter the Commission' s proposal, mainly through, firstly, adding a number of areas to which legislation is applicable and, secondly, through establishing a number of rights at European level.
For example, the Luxembourg process which applies to employment policy is to be extended to social protection and social exclusion.
The major powers, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and, to some extent, Italy, are all agreed in their desire to dominate the small countries of Eastern or Southern Europe that are applying for accession to the European Union.
However, for legal reasons we think that it is wrong to refer to it at this early stage in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, because it was not possible to reach formal agreement on it within the convention, reflecting its structure, and it therefore has no legal status.
Inclusion of new text into the Treaties is likely to create legal confusion.
Elsewhere, the rapporteur repeats the new theory in vogue in Brussels of the supposed dual legitimacy of the European Union: that of the citizens represented by the European Parliament and that of the States represented by the Council.
The Swedish and Danish Social Democrats have today voted against Oliver Duhamel' s report on incorporating the Treaties into a constitution.
To this end, it is essential that the European Union should move towards a Constitution that incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
A constitution would be meaningful only if it formed the democratic framework for a genuine European federation, a United States of Europe.
He told us that he, like the majority of politicians, had been given to believe that we would prefer our relations with other countries to be governed by international treaty.
I welcome Mr Duhamel' s report as an interesting and constructive contribution to the idea of constitutionalisation of the Treaties.
We think a re-organising of the Treaties and their simplification would make it easier for citizens to see clearly the field of EU responsibilities - and their limits - as well as the procedures for exercising these responsibilities.
Until the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, Europe was an intergovernmental super-syndicate.
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is voting against Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado' s report on enhanced cooperation.
It reflects far too monolithic a concept of the Union, under which all forms of cooperation would have to operate within a 'single institutional framework' and would necessarily be directed towards the objective creating a super-state.
So we must avoid slowing down the general pace and therefore allow some Member States to move forward by developing the mechanism of reinforced cooperation.
The operating structures of the internal market have been a success ever since the early 1990s.
European cooperation can be useful in solving cross-border problems.
These regions could act as a wonderful laboratory in terms of sustainable development.
The technocrats, the European judges, wanted to abolish the 'dock dues' , which provide resources for our municipalities in the French overseas departments and, in particular, protect our traditional workforce.
France, on the other hand, owns overseas departments in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean.
It is vital to its credibility that it is independent.
Our vote has thus clarified the composition of the future European Agency, while also setting out our specific requirements regarding its funding and its independence.
Secondly, the European agency must be completely independent.
We have to bear in mind the type of practices employed in farming and the food industry, the problem of imported foodstuffs, the composition of the ingredients of animal feedingstuffs, the maximum levels of dioxins and pesticide residues, food additives and other matters, giving priority to food safety.
We voted for Amendment No 15 because we are very strongly committed to defending the European cultural heritage in relation to locally produced food.
We have no margins in virtually all the categories.
There too we should now like to place 50% against the budget line and 50% in the reserve.
Yet, I have noticed that proposals have also been moved here to reduce the budget.
Report (A5-0300/2000) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2001 - Section III, Commission [C5-0300/2000 - 1999/2190(BUD)]
Madam President, my name appears as a signatory to various amendments on this report.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The real surprise in this budget relates to external actions, where selfishness and stinginess are the rule.
Funds can also be released through mobilisation of the flexibility instrument.
I voted against the Haug report, just as I voted in favour of my group' s motion to reject the general budget for 2001.
We refer in particular to the new pilot scheme to finance information measures in the fight against paedophilia.
That, if anything, demonstrates the low level of motivation that this EU project has, even among politically active citizens.
So 20 to 30% of the contracts will again be offered to private competition.
Since this is not guaranteed in this report, I voted against it.
Add the unacceptably low national thresholds which decimate subsidies to the proposed reductions in withdrawals to 5% for citrus fruits, 8.5% for apples and pears and 10% for other fruit and vegetables in marketable quantities, and it soon becomes clear that there will be no way of disposing of very large quantities of processable fruits and vegetables with the result that overall prices will drop and the crops will be left to rot in the fields and in the cooperative packaging shops, forcing farmers to uproot their crops.
I voted in favour of this report because it lives up to the expectations of Portuguese organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector, which have called for a drastic overhaul of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables, which they consider to be extremely damaging to our national interests.
Johan Van Hecke Report (A5-0296/2000)
The root of the problem lies in the fact that everything, including the quality of the environment and the climate, is sacrificed to capitalist exploitation of wealth-producing resources and excessive profit.
Kyoto' s guiding principle was that the rich countries would keep their own atmosphere clean, although they were allowed, up to a point, to add the emission which they were helping reduce elsewhere to their own table of results.
The fight against the greenhouse effect is a major challenge for the industrialised countries and constitutes a specific duty in respect of the peoples of the developing world who are already paying for the consequences of global warming.
The trick is to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a judicious manner.
We also need to safeguard and strengthen efforts to identify substances which are suspected of being endocrine disrupters, perhaps within a legislative framework.
The consumer and SME do not benefit enough from the internal market which was completed following the introduction of the euro.
After all, banks have so far been obliged by the Member States to notify their central banks of any cross-border payments over EUR 12 500, for the benefit of balance of payment reporting statistics.
Needless to say, these companies will be subject to the same strict conditions in terms of security and money-laundering.
We even know of cases in which transfer fees for cross-border payments increased when the euro was introduced, and not only by a modest amount.
The European Central Bank could help by creating a single European data format for credit transfers and by supporting moves to create a uniform European bank sort code within the international IBAN system.
It is crucial for consumers to accept the euro.
Madam President, Mrs Peijs' report on retail payments in the internal market takes up Parliament' s longstanding complaint about the high cost of cross-border payments within the Union.
The Peijs report makes the point in recital D of the motion for a resolution, and I quote: 'the high level of charges for cross-border credit transfers is damaging the confidence of consumers in the euro' .
We therefore have much to do in this area but the political resources and remedies politicians possess to deal with that are fewer than those we are able to employ to resolve this problem of Internal Market payments.
In the future, the euro area will also feel like a domestic area and the public do not understand why in this area, in which there are no exchange-related risks and in which electronic payments with Internet banking are increasingly becoming a matter of course, transferring money from Munich to Salzburg is considerably more expensive than transferring money from Munich to Kiel.
Both the Commission and Parliament will need to invest many more years of work in order to realise this objective.
On that occasion, we will also be looking into reducing the implementation period for cross-border transfers, which Mrs Peijs calls for in her report.
The debate is closed.
It does seem sound policy to favour a pragmatic and hands-on approach, putting the small business at the heart of the system, rather than a proposal merely producing balanced statistics that are quite impossible to use in practice, on the pretext of avoiding a scattershot approach.
But I have three specific comments on this programme.
Bear in mind that the first Community action programme in this area was adopted in 1983, seventeen years ago.
In addition, I have always been an advocate of underpinning these goals with efficient and pragmatic policy.
They are the true economic and innovation vanguard, in the front line and openly exposed to the risks inherent in this domain.
We must take account of the results of and follow-up to the work of the Science and Governance Conference held last week in Brussels under the auspices of the Seville Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, because there is plenty of overlap with the subject we are dealing with today.
The rapporteur has listed a number of key points in a bid to strengthen the European entrepreneurial climate.
This is excellent for Europe because help can be given quickly and competently in the form of technically correct information.
Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Montfort for the excellent work she has done.
The importance is to strike the right balance, to avoid having a continual situation of people failing at the expense of other people.
This is unjust and I therefore support this report.
It is also the guiding principle of the Charter for Small Enterprises.
The programme will ensure that the networks provide this information.
Clearly, the basic objective of the plan is to stem migration towards the Member States of the European Union and repatriate illegal immigrants living in the Union.
I particularly stress the need to take steps to improve internal security, strengthen dialogue between European officials and local authorities in Albania and, as far as the Commission and Council are concerned, to promote specific action involving cooperation with the Albanian, Italian and Greek authorities.
The poor social, economic and political conditions combined with a lack of or insufficient legal certainty and organised crime are causing migration on a huge scale.
Mr President, unlike Mrs Pack, I am of the opinion that the more groups that are involved in Albania the better.
Clearly, there is no instant solution to be found to the entire problem, but in the slightly longer term it is a matter of creating a world of reasonable justice, of security and of opportunities for the future.
There is also a chasm between the donors, that is to say all of us, Europe and the United States, who give money, organise projects and such like, and the actual people in the field.
Let us make use of bilateral agreements to define jobs, periods of residency, places of residency, pay, hours, working and national insurance conditions clearly and legally, so that immigrants can prove their strength and help to improve our economies and build friendship and cooperation between peoples, rather than nationalist, cold-war aspirations.
Some of the people being sent back have integrated well.
The main area of focus must not be how the flood of immigrants and refugees may be brought under control, but how conditions in the region can be improved so that people can stay in their homes.
Mr President, I agree with Mr Dimitrakopoulos that the central issue in respect of the problems in Albania - be these of an economic, social or internal security nature - continues to be that of helping that country to reinstate the rule of law, bring security to the citizens, and restore the credibility of institutions and local administrations.
Like Mr Lisi, I believe that we need to incorporate burden-sharing in our policy on asylum and refugees.
The action plan for Albania and its neighbouring regions was adopted in June this year and it is thus the sixth in order.
There, frustration with, but also alienation from, European law becomes apparent from time to time, and we should like to urge Parliament, but also the other Community institutions, not to shy away from paying painstaking attention to detail here, to work with precision, and also to make the necessary time and staff available to do this.
With this report we want to send out a signal to the public that we are taking their complaints about the deficient quality of lawmaking and the complaints about over-regionalisation and centralism seriously.
It is of course quite a significant topic, although this is not immediately evident from the small number of members present in this Chamber to continue with the debate.
In addition, and vitally, the report raises the issue of subsidiarity, which is in some measure controversial in this Chamber tonight.
It would also be very worthwhile if the Commission could make an inventory of the existing body of law in the light of that principle, to make it simpler, more transparent, more effective and more relevant, and to repeal superfluous texts, as Paragraph 6 of this report invites it to do.
Having studied the report with great care, I have come to the conclusion that it is not even a political principle: it is a theological principle.
Observance of the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be guaranteed right down to the smallest communities, to autonomous units, to intermediate groups, social groups, families and citizens who are the only true sovereign power when it comes to legislative and administrative action.
Let me, then, give an overall view.
I give the floor to the Commissioner.
Is that an area where we should go for detailed regulation, with guarantees that will be implemented everywhere or should we consider whether a voluntary agreement, provided that it can be enforced and controlled, as an alternative?
I voted in favour of the report, despite the fact that I did not get a number of amendments through, because it also concerns the excessively high exchange and transfer costs in the euro area.
If, in 15 months' time, the same coins and notes are introduced in 11 Member States, it will be more expensive to get hold of that single currency outside the country in which you live.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by lamenting the fact that the Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr Fischler, cannot be here today.
It must be an agreement which provides an impetus for fisheries cooperation and the Moroccan fishing industry, but which also fully satisfies the fisheries interests of the European fleets.
Consequently, we have reached a consensus to work together with a view to achieving a responsible partnership, and Morocco will give its views at a meeting to be held, as you have already pointed out, in Brussels, on 30 October, that is, on Monday.
A few weeks ago, I myself was in Algeciras on the southern coast of Spain, which is not far from Morocco.
Time has taught us that this could turn from being difficult to being impossible.
By means of the fisheries agreements, the European Union is able to engage in fishing operations and exchange fishing rights with third countries.
I was reading in a Swedish fishing trade journal about how one of these boats lands its catch in El Aaiún, described as a Moroccan harbour.
In fact, all our fishing agreements are being called into question not just those with Morocco, as there is also Mauritania and soon there will be Guinea among others to consider.
It has taken eleven months to arrive at the inflexible positions that we have today and the meeting on the 30th, and in this respect we should value the latest measures from Commissioner Fischler, the results of his trip to Morocco on the 26th of last month and the high level meetings that took place, including the one with the King himself.
However, I would like to convey a few brief messages to the Commission, which is worthily represented today by Commissioner Busquin.
My question to the Commission is this: if an agreement is not reached with Morocco, or if this agreement is concluded under the terms indicated by the Commission, an agreement that stimulates Moroccan production, is the Commission planning to adopt structural measures to compensate for the losses that will occur in the regions affected.
As we imagined, the difficulties in negotiating with the Moroccan authorities have been considerable.
Lastly, in the undesirable event that negotiations should fail, the Union has a political and moral duty to support the fishermen and shipowners with a reasonable amount of aid that will ensure that they have the means to live.
We have to resolve the overcapacity situation in the EU fisheries industry.
That is why we need to forge close economic and political relations with Morocco as quickly as possible, while at the same time defending our European fisheries interests.
That is why the Commission is working on the basis of a new partnership aimed at an interesting development between the two parties involving, on the one hand, the development of the entire Moroccan fishing industry, the fleet, aquaculture, commercial processing and research and, on the other, providing European fishermen with fishing opportunities.
Rights of language teachers
" It is not only in German that this makes a clear difference.
In July 1999, the Commission brought this infringement procedure before the Court of Justice.
Therefore, until we manage to harmonise the laws - which we hope to do - respect for the principle of subsidiarity for the moment means that it is impossible on the grounds of discrimination to do away with something which is in all probability a request for a privilege.
We can perhaps accept that the previous Commission under Mr Santer was not the best, so that is why it went.
Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market from all over the Union and from all the parties have come together to say that it is no use talking about rights, advocating charters of rights if you do not, in real cases when people's rights are denied, take effective action to get them recognised and to get them enforced, and that is the problem in this case.
This is quite unacceptable in a modern Europe.
Obviously education still comes under subsidiarity but, within the framework of the Treaties, the freedom of movement of workers and the ban on discrimination apply to everyone, although we - and I in particular, coming as I do from a highly federalist state - support the principle of subsidiarity as a principle of order in our dealings with the European Union and do what we can so that powers are divided as quickly as possible between the levels in Europe in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
In this context, it can no longer be a question of discrimination.
Mr President, would you go for treatment to somebody who knows all the surgical terms in Italian, English, French and German, or would you go to a surgeon?
(The sitting was closed at 10.56 a.m.)
We extend our deepest sympathies to them.
I will now give the floor to Mr Ceyhun, who will speak in his capacity as rapporteur and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
With regard to the statements by the Council and the Commission on the third Asia-Europe Meeting, the Council has informed us that it does not wish to speak for the moment.
Therefore, under the Treaties and under the Euratom Treaty this issue falls within the competence of the Commission; it affects or may affect many citizens who are not just Spanish, because in this area and its surroundings - and there is no emergency plan in place - there are hundreds of thousands of European citizens from the fifteen countries of the Union as well as many people from outside, because this is the Costa del Sol.
Madam President, it is sad but very enlightening to learn from the Spanish Minister of the Interior, Mr Mayor Oreja, that there is no point in talking with Basque nationalists, even if a new cease-fire were to take place in the future.
May I ask that we consider, this week, a Commission statement on the decision of the UK government to introduce a discriminatory tax on non-British road hauliers.
Since the allegedly liberal parties, including the European liberal parties, always tend to ally themselves with parties of xenophobic, racist, authoritarian inspiration, I feel that this is not only a serious danger for Italy, but also an indication of something which concerns the whole of Europe.
The report also contains some criticism, however, of the French proposal.
These requests are covered in Amendments Nos 2 and 4 of Mrs Karamanou' s report.
The initiative from the French Presidency that we are examining today is aimed at improving the two blanket conventions on mutual assistance in criminal matters that I have just mentioned, specifically in the field of combating money laundering.
In this respect, I can only say that if the concept of combating money laundering is damaged, then this is the fault of the Council and not of Parliament.
We can but congratulate them on their work.
The way forward, as Mr Marinho says - and I agree with him - is communitisation.
Everybody who has spoken agrees that it is a very valuable initiative and we support what it says.
What we need is for Europol to be given operational capability across frontiers.
There is too much of that in our contemporary Europe and before I give my support to a headlong rush to mutual recognition, I would like to see common recognition of fair standards.
I realise it is very difficult because here we have to construct something from a scattering of instruments.
However, it is also necessary if we are to strengthen the attractiveness of the European Union as a location for business; moreover it is something which the public wants and we must respect their wishes because the people who live in the European Union have a right to security.
In the European Union, we must continue to fight resolutely against money laundering, in the knowledge that, particularly after the creation of the single market and the liberalisation of the capital and financial services markets, there needs to be effective police and judicial cooperation between Member States which is as efficient as possible.
There is no reason to assume that, if a lawyer is acting as a financial adviser, he or she is not exercising his or her profession.
By the same token, I wish to say that I am aware of the sensitiveness of the issue raised by various Members about the conditions in which the confidentiality of the legal professions may constitute a justified refusal to cooperate in the fight against money laundering.
This is especially true of serious, very serious and cross-border crimes.
Overall the task is so great and so important that it cannot be overseen by the Council alone.
It follows that citizens' rights must be reinforced by adopting an effective instrument and recognising the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, not least with regard to its right of interpretation and its power to decide on a case or not.
Therefore, whilst I support more cooperation and coordination, I think making this a legislative system would be wrong and we would oppose it.
The second point is also interesting, of course.
This is a positive development, and it is therefore gratifying that there should be so much support for it in Parliament.
I will take the opportunity - since several Members have raised very delicate issues - to tell you quite frankly that, as Mr Coelho has just said, we primarily view this initiative as an opening initiative that demonstrates the political will of the Council to make up the ground lost in the field of judicial cooperation in comparison to police cooperation.
And this is why I also see in this an important tool for ensuring judicial control of Europol.
The FAIR Programme - Fisheries, Agriculture and Agro-Industrial Research - was part of the fourth Framework Programme which ran from 1994 to 1998.
Given the importance of the research programme for agriculture and fisheries, it is regrettable that some problems were identified in connection with the organisation of the programme.
The Court of Auditors' report on the FAIR Programme, from which the rapporteur' s report arises, was only published in March this year even though the sector letters regarding the audit were first sent to the Commission in December 1998 and February 1999.
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I should like to call attention to a fairly small number of points.
You have underscored, and I would thank you for this, the spirit underlying this report, in your dialogue with the Court of Auditors and the Commission' s services and in the value you attached to it.
This shows that the Commission has not been idle and that it is acting on the comments that you have made.
I will now turn to the question that Mrs Morgan asked concerning the recovery of amounts.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The prize will be awarded to the 'Basta Ya' association in the course of the December part-session.
It marks - and I am firmly convinced of this, even if many Heads of State and Government prefer not to admit it - the beginning of the constitutional process which this Parliament has called for so often and with such persistence.
I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to address the House as part of an in-depth debate on this fine project to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union before Parliament adopts its final position on this text.
I, personally, have no doubt that such an opportunity will present itself.
It is true, nonetheless, that it has been possible to make a number of criticisms regarding the content of the Charter.
I feel this is a significant statement - one that I welcome.
It is a huge feather in this institution's cap - as is the fact that the groups stood side by side here - that we managed to secure 16 places for European Parliament representatives at the fundamental rights convention.
The Charter before us is, to my mind, a huge success and may, as I read in one of the European broadsheets on 26 September 2000, become the calling card for Europe.
Therefore, my Group still thinks that it is absolutely essential to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6(2) of the Treaty.
Many people thought that Europe at long last had the opportunity to emerge from the single free-trade area and the liberal rut in order to establish the foundation of a People' s Europe.
At the European Summit in Nice, in December, civil society resolved to mobilise in order to make itself heard and to forcefully express its desire for a charter offering the citizens of Europe genuine guarantees.
To this end, besides the signatures, it is important for there to be effective political undertakings implemented within the timeframe - every day - by all the countries and political forces.
So let us either lament or pretend to rejoice, let us celebrate this great event which is actually just a perfectly empty great event.
The convention did a grand job.
So individual rights and citizens' rights are included, but also social rights.
The right to good administration, which Mrs Malmström also talked about, is one of the most important advances of all.
I am not sure yet, because I have not heard from them, how far Mr Blair's hounds will be let free from the leash to speak out for this brilliant project.
Last time, you spoke of the glass being half full or half empty.
Yet the Cologne Council, with the assistance of the Convention, doing a magnificent job of creating confusion, managed ultimately to make every one forget that this area lay within the jurisdiction of the national parliaments, and that jurisdiction is being gradually spirited out of the hands of these parliaments.
Having too much in the way of fundamental rights protection is just as damaging as having too little.
When listening to the speeches from some members, one realises that this information is more necessary than ever.
The big question that now divides us is what this Charter is for.
We will, of course, vote for the Charter, but we will do so with the feeling that it will not succeed in arousing that enthusiasm and that sense of participation by the citizens of Europe which are so necessary and, as usual, it will be the governments - and some governments more than others - who will have to bear the historical responsibility.
According to the co-rapporteur, Mr Duff, this is a major step towards improving the quality of European integration.
For those who feel the need to do so, I recommend reading the explanations in Convention 49 and also studying that case law from both courts which is bound up with the Treaty.
Mr President, I have long been among the sceptics.
For the first time since the European Union was established we have here the basis of a constitution, a constitution for the supranational structure that is the European Union.
It is a demonstration for a social and democratic Europe of the citizens.
In the meantime, the draft Charter can serve as an interesting subject for debate amongst the parties, trade unions, environmental organisations, churches and the many other groupings in the Member States and the candidate states of the Union, regarding future cooperation between European nations.
I wish to focus on three points that have already been raised by other Members here this morning.
The Charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon.
I shall, of course, add my voice to those of the men and women wishing to include a reference to the Charter in Article 6, and to actually incorporate the Charter itself into the Treaties at a later date.
We have already seen the case of Bernard Connolly whose critical book regarding the Commission was suppressed by the Court of First Instance.
This is an important amalgamation at a time when the European Union is required to define the legal status, in terms of rights and duties, of third country nationals legally resident within the European Union.
Just like him, I am convinced, firstly, that it will have singular effects in the immediate short term and, secondly, that it will shortly become binding.
In the course of this debate, I have heard a number of telling phrases: the Charter has been described as a bone thrown to keep the dog that is the European Parliament quiet, or indeed as a flimsy attempt to conceal the fights relinquished by a French Presidency that is on its last legs, seen especially in of the way in which it conducted the IGC.
This is why Parliament has proposed the setting up of a Europe-Turkey Forum involving expert representatives of the Turkish community and appointed MEPs who would consider in depth the issues involved.
Unanimity does not mean that we are all satisfied with the state of Turkish democracy or that country' s treatment of human rights; we are not.
Having said that, I am of course aware that Turkey' s candidature continues to raise questions.
The Presidency' s preference is for this draft to be adopted very quickly, indeed, if possible, as early as 20 November, the date of the forthcoming General Affairs Council, and, as I have already mentioned, for it to comply with the very specific decisions adopted in Helsinki.
However, the Commission stands by what it has clearly stated in its progress report, i.e. that Turkey, like every other candidate country, must meet the Copenhagen criteria during the process of rapprochement.
President Sezar clearly stated why Turkey had no alternative but to embark on this process of reform in his address to the Turkish Government last month and I fully endorse what the Turkish President said.
Thank you.
There have been a few vaguely positive signs here.
We will resist the efforts, some of them fairly spurious, to upset the balance the report successfully achieves, especially those amendments which seek to set up the European Parliament as a tribunal upon the past.
It is a clear fact, just as it is clear that Turkey, like any civilised society, should get used to the idea of facing up to its past, however terrible it may have been.
Turkey's membership on this basis, rather than for the geo-strategic reasons put forward by the USA or NATO, would enrich the European Union and represent a significant step towards a united Europe.
Have we forgotten that only a small part of Turkish territory falls within the European continent?
We shall therefore vote against this report, just as we have voted against all the reports seeking to make Turkey a member of the European Union.
It will have done more harm if Turkey's expectations of accession have been raised and cannot be met because of the political situation.
Report (A5-0310/2000) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors Special Report No 9/99 concerning research activities in the field of agriculture and fisheries (FAIR Programme - Fisheries, Agriculture and Agro-Industrial Research), together with the Commission' s replies (C5-0227/2000 - 2000/2133(COS))
. I welcome this report and will vote for it.
Instead of pulling human rights and social rights up to a higher level, the Charter will enable actions that will effectively reduce them to the lowest common denominator.
There is no doubt that its ultimate purpose is as a precursor to an impending European Constitution which, in turn, will be the jewel in the crown of the EU's attempt to become a federation in which the institutional arrangements are such that decisions are taken by the minority of strong members but apply to everyone, the main purpose being to serve the interests of private monopolies in the European Union, at the expense of the workers and the people in general.
Article 2(2) provides a typical example, "No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed.
There is no statement, despite our requests, to the effect that a family is made up of a man and a woman raising their children, and that that is the basic unit of society.
To the extent that no one has elected the judges, this represents a diminution of democratic government.
Admittedly, I would have liked to see it incorporated directly into the European Treaties!
I nonetheless abstained from the final vote, because I feel that some social rights are expressed less clearly than the economic rights.
The original idea behind the Convention was to have a text adopted by consensus which could subsequently be made binding by the fifteen Member State governments when it was incorporated into the Treaties.
In fact, the fight against social exclusion is relegated to the level of assistance, instead of imposing a requirement for basic rights binding upon employers and states.
Personally, I am convinced that secularism is a liberating factor for the modern world.
Similarly, the social responsibility of ownership has been left out.
This document is clearly not one suited to become legally binding as it is not a legal text.
Members of the Irish government have recently raised questions regarding whether Brussels threatens Irish identity and Mr Ahern, whilst affirming Ireland's EU membership as fundamental to its prosperity and economic success, firmly resisted any rapid movement to a more federal - centralised - Europe, as it would go well beyond what most Europeans currently wish for or are prepared to accept.
No surprise as to what won the day.
Let me point out in passing that seven of the reports presented during this part-session have been in response to national initiatives, proving that where this system is implemented, it is proving to be very productive.
These proactive measures are absolutely essential in order to combat this phenomenon, which has continually grown and taken on an international dimension.
Through this initiative the French Presidency proposes the adoption of a framework decision for the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering (e.g. tracing, freezing and confiscating funds).
All Member States should treat money laundering as a criminal offence carrying a minimum sentence of four years' imprisonment.
As money laundering assumes vast proportions throughout the world it is clear that Europol should have the powers to combat it, with a view to devising a European strategy for police and judicial cooperation.
. I welcome Mrs Roure' s report on another initiative from the French Presidency - this time to step up cooperation in the legal area to ensure that no barriers are put in place to prevent the extradition of suspected criminals accused of money laundering or other related offences involving illicit funds.
Madam President, this is the only report which I voted against.
It would be the first Member State geographically to bridge the gulf between Europe and Asia and to have a mainly Muslim tradition.
That particularly applies at this stage when we are progressively committing more and more of the EIB' s resources, but without fully covering the financial risks we are taking.
In this context, I would like to reiterate the basic conclusion in paragraph 22 that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria and draw attention both to the fact that Turkey has been condemned on numerous occasions for acts and omissions in relation to human rights, democratic freedoms and its international attitude and to the European Parliament's recommendations that Turkey comply with the relevant European values.
What is worrying is that Turkish officials and the Turkish press seems to be taking a reactionary stand, rather than encouraging Turkey to move in this direction.
Eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nicosia is now Europe' s only divided capital.
Too little progress has been made and Turkey must do better.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to speak in this debate in my capacity as the author of the report on the accession of Cyprus.
Mr President, we cannot vote in favour of the Morillon report due because we are convinced that, contrary to what is being maintained and what many people in Turkey hope, the accession process will not improve the standard of living of the people.
At the same time, however, I feel we must not paint the situation blacker than it actually is.
In other words there is an internal link here.
Euro-Mediterranean conferences in Marseilles
Mr Brok, who has now rejoined us, asked questions specifically about the delays noted in negotiations.
We Europeans have experience that we can profitably share.
In fact, it is no longer just a matter, as it was in 1995, of restoring balance with Eastern Europe, but also of making ready for the future enlargement of the European Union.
Xenophobia and national and other forms of terrorism come under this heading and I hope that we shall have a chance to straighten things out here too.
That is a fact that, alas, we have to live with.
But here again we should be frank.
All this shows that we are aware of how inadequate the results achieved thus far have been, although I feel that the responses are not yet sufficient to deal with the situation, even though it is true that five years are certainly not a very long time over which to judge such complex processes.
This is why I feel that the debate taking place today could serve to make us aware that this policy is of key importance for the entire Union.
We do not need to create competition between all these various needs but to find new resources.
The spiralling violence in the Middle East, the war being waged so violently and resolutely against the Palestinian people, whose right to statehood is still being denied by Israel, are all threatening the future of the entire region.
Mr President, in Nice the European Union will need to strike a balance between integration and enlargement and in Marseilles it will need to strike a balance between its function in central Europe and its responsibility in the Mediterranean.
However, in all the evaluations that are now being made of five years of the Barcelona process, many people think that we can be satisfied simply that the process is continuing, due to the fact that there have been ministerial meetings attended by representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon, etc. And this is, perhaps, a sad consolation.
There are many common problems that are currently affecting the Euro-Mediterranean area: illegal immigration, poverty, foreign debt, human rights, drought and terrorism, which mercilessly destroys the lives of innocent individuals and families, as we are tragically experiencing in Spain, Algeria and the Middle East.
We are willing to believe them, but the countries of the South need more than just promises and speeches, and it is up to us to give them those things.
Europe has not produced any policies on desertification or on water that benefit the Mediterranean countries and we need to think about a Mediterranean environment policy that understands the location, the systems and also the climatic diversity of the Mediterranean.
The proposals now on the table have been far more successful in striking this balance.
Then there is the question of the agency in Kosovo.
We must not disappoint them in their expectations, and now more than ever these countries need our help.
I conclude by repeating the Commission' s own words - that these two proposals are the cornerstone of a process that should lead these countries, which have had and still have so many problems, to become fully integrated into the structures of Europe.
In future, responsibility must be vested in a few people, including a director, if you like, so that really one person is responsible vis-à-vis the committee which selects the individual programmes.
So my thanks to all my fellow members who see this as an important objective and I am delighted that we shall be able to bring these countries more in the way of content in the future.
I read in some reports about the elections in Bosnia that the extreme nationalists have won at the parliamentary elections held in Bosnia Herzegovina.
As you will be aware, the European Union, has contributed significantly to these historic developments.
Examination of the reports by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza and Mr Lagendijk on proposals for a Regulation concerning a framework programme on the one hand, and the European Agency for Reconstruction on the other, provide us with an opportunity to assess the scale of the support that the Union intends to give the Western Balkans in relation to the Stabilisation and Association Process.
The long-awaited victory of democracy in Croatia, and then in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, forces the European Union, as we are well aware, to take things much further.
Question Time (Council)
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 2 and 3 will be taken together.
Both parties have just been granted a new deadline of four months - by Resolution 1324 - to try and make some progress on both counts.
I should like to ask about progress with the association agreement with Morocco.
The stability and development of the Caucasus are one of the European Union' s strategic priorities.
As regards discussions with Turkey, we have just held an important debate on this issue and you are well aware of the European Union' s position with regard to this matter.
I just want the Minister to re-emphasise that this proposed legislation is aimed at those who exploit and make profit out of people in a desperate situation and is not aimed at further criminalising the immigrant or potential immigrant.
There is a need both for legislation and measures to stimulate debate and increase awareness.
In my view, we must indeed do everything within our power, absolutely everything, to combat such crimes, and I note that the Council, the United Nations General Assembly and the Turkish Government, as far as I know, are prepared to do this.
It is precisely because the other 14 Member States disapproved that they imposed sanctions against it.
If, for example, and here I am talking as a Minister, France was to elect an extreme right-wing party to office tomorrow, I would hope that the other countries would take measures against it similar to those taken against Austria.
I personally wanted to talk about values: I have spoken about values as they appear in our texts and I have spoken about the values that appear in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I have spoken, in particular, it is true, about the fight against all forms of discrimination, as appears on the title page of all European texts and which is something we should ensure is respected.
I should like to remind you that this political dialogue constitutes, along with the future Accession Partnership, one of the elements in Turkey' s pre-accession strategy, which was set out on this occasion.
Question No 12 by (H-0850/00):
This is what we shall endeavour to do and it is along these lines that we intend to proceed and no other.
On this occasion, it must be said that Morocco did not respond to the offer made by the Community.
These are citizens from Scotland where after 110 days of detention any person charged with an offence must either be brought to trial or released and never again charged with that offence.
Have specific measures been taken (such as security of supplies and energy efficiency) to make the economies of the Member States less sensitive to external crises, and what are the Council' s methods and short-term and medium-term priorities for energy efficiency and energy saving?
The position of the European Union on the extra-territorial measures decreed by the United States has not changed.
Finally, I recalled that it was with concern that the European Union took note of the observations made by the United Nations' agencies and programmes on the ground and deplored the negative, and often tragic, repercussions of the US economic embargo as they affected the Cuban population.
Does the Council not understand that this is a supremely political problem and that it is unacceptable for it to maintain a position which is equidistant from both the offender and the victim?
This agency complies with the Commission's decision on decentralisation and is exceptionally efficient in managing the project for which it is responsible.
We must combat illegal cross-border activities, be they in connection with the drug trade, cross-border cooperation or trafficking in human beings.
It would be a good idea for Commissioner Patten, who has a great deal of experience - not to say wisdom - in managing international crises, to add to the visits which he has made to various regions of the Balkans by going to the headquarters of the Reconstruction Agency in Thessaloniki in order to see how this department works.
But this region, the most troubled region of Europe, has never held such hope as it does now.
I should like, first of all, to thank the House for its excellent and speedy work during its examination of these two draft regulations.
We have achieved rapid results in Serbia too, where the Commission, in the space of just over four weeks, has drawn up an emergency assistance programme worth in total EUR 200 million.
Naturally we can also accept the proposal that the guidelines which the Commission will adopt should reflect the search for greater efficiency that underlines our reforms.
I hope that Parliament will understand the sense of the proposals that I put forward in May and will continue to work constructively with others on this very difficult issue but I cannot offer to support Parliament's amendment to remove the unanimity requirement which would contradict the view of the College.
The challenge for the third summit in Seoul was to deepen the ASEM process both for governmental participants and for the broader public.
In the related people-to-people field, the principle of opening the ASEM process to a larger segment of civil society was maintained, although the NGO initiative to establish a social forum could not be realised because of the resistance of certain Asian partners.
In this respect we are extremely lucky that the summit in Seoul took place at all and that, with one or two exceptions, all the heads of government attended.
In fact two concrete proposals have been adopted, notably the round table on globalisation and the duo fellowship programme, 4300 fellowships amounting to a total cost of USD 25 million.
The Commission' s communication confines itself to dealing with those aspects relating to the powers of the Community and Member States in tasks arising from their participation in those organisations.
When we think that, of all the coastal countries in the world, very few have the economic, judicial, legislative and political potential that the European Union has, that should tell us how much we should be asking ourselves what our responsibility is.
Reform of the CFP will be critical but getting the right reforms will be even more important.
There is hardly a fish in it which is permanently domiciled.
Throughout the European Union and far beyond we are all well aware of that.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by thanking you for your support for our efforts to promote and strengthen the Community's participation in regional fisheries organisations.
Some progress has already been made but our efforts must focus on better planning.
The ongoing improvement of the productivity of pig producers is already generating a growth in supply and if this were to be accompanied by the unlimited extension of the apparatus of production, it would inevitably result, once again, in a serious imbalance in the market.
Instead, it makes more sense if every pigfarmer sets up his own reserve, i.e. if every pigfarmer has his own piggy bank.
Reference is also made to the need to encourage producer organisations, the prevalence of which varies greatly from one Member State to another.
The way in which the organisations of the market have worked in the past has served rather than impeded the concentration process.
The globalisation of the economy is a red herring here and cyclical crises have absolutely nothing to do with it.
Producers from all over the European Union will be able to subscribe to this measure.
Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Garot, has dealt with the Commission' s proposal for pig industry funding realistically and in precise terms.
It is a question of balance.
I am therefore bound to say that I have reached a different conclusion to that of Mr Garot, and whilst I am almost inclined to say that I could almost go along with the Commission proposal in its present form, since we also have a duty to be honest, I feel that, basically, it does not actually do anything to address the issues.
Then there is the question of including specialist breeders in the proposed system, as stated in proposed Amendments Nos 7 and 13.
Then what, pray, has the Commission presented to us?
Firstly, there is an analysis of the budgetary implementation of the budgetary management practices within the specific financial headings.
The Court repeats, consequently, its comments of previous years on the negative effects of this, for instance poor and hasty decisions, heavy workload creating a risk of errors and so on.
The dramatic events of the recent past have clearly demonstrated the increasing importance of management and control issues on the European agenda.
This means that conscientious Member States are financially penalised and less conscientious ones are financially rewarded.
However, not only are we heading in the right direction, we have also already covered a significant part of the ground. One of the milestones we have already passed is the 2001 budget, which the Commission has, for the first time, presented using activity-based budgeting.
The European Parliament now finds itself in an extremely difficult situation because earlier this year, in January, it declared that it could no longer accept a situation in which the 1999 closure was still marred by serious errors.
I should like to draw attention to a number of problems, and I hope that Mr Karlsson will be able to answer my questions today.
We must have more figures, and we must have more facts.
I shall try as early as this year to see whether this can be done so that we can make a start on assessing the Directorates-General.
Of course, we all know that the Commission is working on its programme of reform.
This will diminish the level of errors.
Therefore, now and in the future, the Commission will be held to account for non-compliance with the rules.
Can I first of all thank Mr Karlsson because cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control this year has been much better than in previous years.
I call on you also to publish a league table of those countries which have the worst record of maladministration in the EU and in what areas.
Madam President, I too would like to very sincerely thank the Court of Auditors for its report and also for the assessment that the Court gave the Committee on Budgetary Control yesterday, in which it stressed once again the much-needed efforts being made at reform.
The points Mrs van der Laan made earlier should be included, and I am pleased to say that we agree about that.
That may require giving the President of the Court more power to take decisions on the Court's working methods and on the way it communicates.
Rates differ from one Member State to the next; their make-up also differs from one Member State to the next.
In what has been its most important work on the common agricultural policy, the special report on arable crops, the Court concluded that, from 1993 to 1997, the Community budget paid out a sum of more than EUR 13 billion more than could reasonably have been expected.
Do not ask me questions that are impossible to answer.
The Court of Auditors also has to change its working methods.
There is always something to be happy about.
This report was approved by a large majority in the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, and I shall therefore stand by the result of the Committee' s vote.
My second point is about export bans, which have previously been so highly praised.
I therefore have some very considerable reservations and wish to reject this particular provision.
At second or third reading it is necessary to secure the famous 314 votes, and if the report is still in the same form as now that will certainly not happen.
The Commission have begun to take a tentative but welcome step in that direction and perhaps the Commissioner will say more about that when he replies.
We concur with the rapporteur where he has highlighted the importance of providing consumers with information about the risks, and the need for transparency, especially in the sphere of health and safety.
I would have thought it would be better to take more account of subsidiarity.
However, I do recall a substantial discussion which I had with my daughter, Elisabetta, when she was nine years old and wanted to be allowed to go out on her own.
We need to ensure seamless consumer protection but without regulating the same things more than once or even in contradictory ways.
Then I would like to stress the importance of the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which increase transparency towards the end consumer and apportion responsibility to distributors as well as producers in the event of products deemed dangerous being withdrawn from the market.
This also means that when new sectoral legislation is devised it supersedes the corresponding provisions of this directive.
Many of the proposed amendments of the report are an improvement on the text and can therefore be accepted by the Commission.
Thirdly, Amendment No 4 proposes adding, in a preamble, a requirement that Member States draw up factual reports with the cooperation of competent and independent public or private institutions.
Although the Commission is in favour of cooperation and common principles, the proposed wording runs counter to subsidiarity.
No problems have been reported to the Commission with the existing wordings and the changes would weaken the provisions.
Amendments Nos 39 and 44 propose that information on dangerous products should only be available to the public once a banning or withdrawal decision has been issued and that exchange of information protected by professional secrecy should not be possible between market surveillance authorities.
Mr Martelli, normally you can only speak at the end of voting time, but I shall, exceptionally, give you the floor for a few moments.
Report (A5-0294/2000) by Mrs Eriksson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005) (COM(2000) 335 - C5-0386/2000 - 2000/0143(CNS))
Mr President, my question relates to the order of the votes on the amendments concerning Paragraph 10, in other words, the genocide in Armenia.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The responsibility is dual, lying with both the governments of the countries of the Union and the governments of the Mediterranean partners as well.
This aid is more than justified in the light of that tragedy.
The ban on night work for women was one of those rare areas in which, by protecting women, the social legislation of certain countries was further advanced for female than for male workers.
I very much hope that in future, by producing an annual review in good time, the Commission will enable this House to carry out a more in-depth analysis and hold a more thorough debate.
Regretfully therefore, I have voted against.
It is important that our products are safe, but we should not go over the top with extreme actions.
Today, the European Agency for Reconstruction is administered by a Governing Board on which the representatives of the Member States and the Commission each have one vote and on which decisions are adopted by a two-thirds majority.
I believe that Serbia's "Algerian problem" is Kosovo.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have voted against a report designed to introduce aid for pigmeat producers in the EU.
The problem is that, even if the French Presidency has shown a degree of openness, we know that the Commission has rejected these proposals and there does not appear to be a majority within the Council in favour of approving them.
A slight variation in the supply is enough to spark a crisis situation.
Mr President, the Armenians' genocide was the first of many genocides in the twentieth century, which might indeed be called the century of genocide.
Because Sweden is not prepared to participate in a common military defence but only in civil crisis management, we cannot support Paragraph 15 which "welcomes Turkey' s determination to contribute to improving European capabilities within the framework of the common European security and defence policy" .
But beyond the duty of remembrance which we must demand from all democracies, and the people of Europe know just how difficult and painful a task this is, so difficult in fact that some European countries have not yet completed it, it is incumbent on us to ensure that such acts of barbarism, which destroyed lives for ethnic, religious and cultural reasons and which offend the conscience of the world, never recur.
This is, of course, a different debate to the one we are having today. But, given the importance I attach to Turkey, I wanted to restate my case today.
Since the people are no longer prevented from exercising their right to self-determination, this has enabled peace to take hold.
I voted today for the amendments calling for this acknowledgement in order to keep this testimony alive and to acknowledge a people' s suffering.
That event took place during the time of the Ottoman Empire.
The Jové Peres report would not only like to regularise this situation for existing regional organisations and those that are in the process of being established, it would also like to reinforce it by putting paid to the Commission' s habit of calling on the support of technical experts from different Member States.
My comments naturally apply to the issue before us today, the representation of the European Community within regional fisheries organisations, but they apply equally to talks conducted for example within the World Trade Organisation.
My suggestion that we should include them in one directive was supported by the then President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Trittin, and by the Commission, which meant that Parliament' s motion to amalgamate three directives did not meet with a great deal of opposition.
I will give you an example: PVC comprises 0.7% of the total amount of incinerated waste.
Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is satisfied by the work that has been carried out during the course of the third reading.
Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Blokland for preparing this subject.
Incineration is not recycling.
The report by Mr Blokland, now at its third reading, was for many members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, elected to Parliament for the first time, the first real test of learning with regard to parliamentary practice.
Stricter emission-limit values have been introduced for new cement kilns that co-incinerate waste, as Mrs Evans pointed out.
However diverse national situations may be, one can recognise in all Member States a more or less general reduction in statutory cover, an enhanced role for supplementary health insurance schemes and a marked increase in discriminating factors.
There should also be a proposal for a directive to include the following points: a prohibition on the use of personal medical data, such as genetic typing, a key point; ensuring that persons joining a scheme are not in principle required to undergo a medical examination; the introduction of an obligation to provide lifelong insurance by the insurer; undertaking to reimburse persons working and moving within the European Union in a more coordinated way and, finally, introducing a mediation procedure.
We are really coming round to the idea of cross-border care and so market forces are becoming increasingly applicable to health care.
For example, although we often take the United States as a model for the free market economy, it would be a fatal mistake to follow their lead in health policy.
It would be wrong if the EU were to devise rules concerning, for example, data relating to health, or requiring everyone to be insured and, in that way, destroy the multiplicity of supplementary health insurance schemes which exist today in many countries and operate on actuarial principles.
It then appeared that there was in fact a way of getting in.
The same applies to the health of all the citizens of our Member States and the cohesion of our territories.
It is not by chance that I am particularly used to facing such problems by virtue of my Dutch background.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rocard is calling on the Commission to define a framework for basic statutory health insurance systems in a Green Paper.
This is a major concern.
Mr President, those of us who have devoted ourselves all our lives to studying social issues will remember that the old manuals used to include a definition of social protection as a set of state protection measures to cover economically assessable risks affecting individuals or families which individuals - family units - could not cover themselves.
Well then, this means that we need to reflect at great length upon the reasons why public health care is in such a state.
Supplementary health insurance presupposes a statutory system of entitlements and provisions.
By trying to eliminate discrimination on the grounds of health status, Mr Rocard would have killed the goose that laid the golden egg.
The Commission will act immediately in the framework of its competences and I will try to reply to the conclusions of your report.
I also hope that the amendments seeking to ensure that qualifications and integration into professional life are given particular attention will be adopted, which is why it is important to take account of the ever-increasing phenomenon of social exclusion and poverty despite paid employment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
The next item is the Commission recommendations for a Council opinion on updating the stability programmes in Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.
This has given us a different idea, making us wonder whether this Stability and Growth Pact has run its course, having achieved the quantitative objective of a particular final figure, or whether it is worth introducing other aspects relating to the quality of public finances in future programmes.
Our basic message is, therefore, that the margin for making tax cuts must be counterbalanced by strict public spending controls.
I believe that, overall, the message here is a positive one.
They state that, in one of the largest countries - which is also one of the most important countries for the European economy, namely Germany - there is a risk of jumping into something resembling overheating.
Mr President, thank you, Mr Della Vedova.
I understand that you wanted me to address you today regarding these two aspects, in other words, the state of play in the fight against BSE in Europe and related developments in France.
We propose that the Commission and the European Union should thus undertake to extend these tests at a European level, in the light of scientific recommendations.
As a result, effectiveness, independence and transparency will be the key principles guiding the assessment of food risks in Europe.
I will return to this point later.
However, it is necessary to put in place such tests on a much larger scale.
Active surveillance measures, including random testing, are in progress to prevent cases of BSE from entering the food and feed chains.
In the situation confronting us it is always tempting to look to a magic solution, a solution which can, in one step, both eliminate risk and restore confidence.
I will be asking Member States on Monday if there are concerns that weaknesses in the implementation of controls over the past several years, in contravention of the Community legislation in the matter, are a factor in the current increased incidence of BSE.
Surely it is possible both to act quickly and to do the job properly.
It is up to you to deliver this legislation quickly.
This is an extremely important requirement, especially where the specific issue of BSE is concerned.
Our group is calling for an immediate ban on MBMs for all livestock as long as Member States are unable to guarantee the implementation of laws preventing BSE and the strict application of European directives.
I do not know if this is a panacea, Commissioner but, in line with the precautionary principle, it seems to me that experience behoves us to ban, as of today, the use of animal meal in feed for livestock, including pigs, poultry and fish.
I find the debate that is underway in this Chamber, which consists in finding out which institution out of the Council, the Commission or Parliament has done the most and which the least, rather unnecessary.
Firstly, as others have said before me, we must have systematic screening of all cattle slaughtered for consumption by European citizens.
By displaying courage and ambition, we can combine the health interests of Europeans and the economic interests of our producers, and thereby restore confidence.
These people are in no way responsible for the crisis, which is why the European Union must show solidarity with them.
I too do not accept the arrogance of certain Member States which, since they do not apply the tests, are not pushing for regulations.
European solidarity must also play a role, because our policy has exposed its inconsistencies: set-aside, animal meal for cattle, nitrates, pesticides.
Then Mr Gollnisch turns round and tells this House that his group has been spearheading the BSE debate.
We also feel that it would be appropriate to ensure that every outbreak of the disease is contained and to place a ban on the export of meat until such time as it is proven to be safe to eat.
On no account should we fail to give this priority its due from the political perspective.
I am glad that we are still looking at the extension of testing on an experimental basis.
But if we introduce generalised screening tests, if we destroy MBMs, if we impose the slaughter of an entire herd for just one sick animal, we must demand strictly equivalent health standards from the third countries who are our commercial partners and who seek to export live animals, carcasses and meat products to the Community.
The causes are to be found somewhere else altogether.
Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commission is finally making a strong case for universal testing, because as the situation in France demonstrates "he who seeks shall find"!
What is preventing us from acting and why must there always be a crisis for us to come here and confirm that we, the European Parliament, believe that public health is the number one priority?
The link between feeding cattle bonemeal - which is, as it happens a very unnatural way to feed animals - and BSE is now clear to everyone.
Therefore I would ask the Commission to work towards a degree of harmonisation on this score too.
I call upon the European Commission to carry out a total review of the systems that are in place in France to deal with cases of BSE.
As a result, the poison goes into the system and, as it does, it destroys the system.
It is indeed difficult to have national legislations and a European legislation existing side by side.
In addition, there is legislation in place setting out how the meat-and-bone meal, how this feed, is to be processed - another safeguard that is introduced into the system to protect public health and food safety.
It has been said that this will be very expensive, will involve a large number of carcasses and so on.
These instances include the 'pillow technique' which led to the death of a female immigrant in Belgium, the use of strong sedatives in Spain, the transporting of immigrants in cramped conditions in the holds of ships in Italy and Spain, the tragic case of the 58 Chinese immigrants found dead at the UK port of Dover after they had been detained on a number of occasions on European soil, and the widespread use of various forms of coercion and intimidation against expelled immigrants.
That is my commitment, for which I accept responsibility.
Violence against women takes many forms: there is violence in the home, a crime which does not speak its name, there is sexual exploitation and there is trafficking in women, i.e. trafficking in human beings.
Mr President, I would say to Mr Nogueira that clearly, in the model that we have defined, monetary policy is the responsibility of the Central Bank and it is the European Central Bank that takes action in line with the criteria established in the Treaty.
Mr President, from a public relations point of view, I believe it is very important to distinguish between internal and external effects, and I would be interested to know if the Commission intends now, with the physical introduction of the euro not far off, to launch a campaign to explain the difference between the internal and external effects of currency stability to the public?
Without action being taken from the Greek side we will pursue the procedure already underway.
What we do is to guarantee that there is a system of monitoring and measuring.
In the same decision, the Commission undertook to review the aid schemes in all the Member States on the basis of the specific compatibility criteria approved until 2004, the date on which the validity of the authorisation for the French support scheme will expire.
To achieve a Europe that encourages integration, in the words of the Lisbon European Council, requires joint effort and joint action.
Secondly, by making it possible to take better account of the experience of operators in the field, NGOs, local authorities, social organisations and of people who are themselves being excluded.
There are many elderly people who would agree with that, as would those who had worked for hours for low wages which do not provide a decent living - farm labourers, for example.
It may be true of people with mental difficulties and of large groups of people who do not have a good enough knowledge of the language in order to get jobs.
In the United States, a more flexible labour market means that periods of poverty and unemployment are only very short.
In my own country something like 75% of those who are working and living below the poverty line are women.
Well then, we must endeavour to implement this major undertaking, at least in part.
This budget should be increased, bearing in mind the processes and the realism that are necessary in this field.
Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mrs Figueiredo and I would like to thank the other Members of Parliament who are not here and who have expressed the opinions of the other committees.
I also agree to highlight the importance of NGOs as well as of regional and local actors as you suggest, and of better reflecting their experience on the ground.
We have already agreed that the Social Protection Committee would meet on a regular basis with the contact group of Members of Parliament.
The next item is the report (A5­0320/2000) by Mrs Rothe, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on a European Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (COM(2000) 279 - C5­0281/2000 - 2000/0116(COD)).
We need binding targets right now.
Another vital point that the committee agreed on was the problem of connection to the grid and access to the grid for renewables.
In the specific case of my country, Spain, these guidelines would be responsible for an additional 225 billion tonnes of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere between now and 2010 and for our being unable to meet the Kyoto targets.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s proposal to create a framework enabling the proportion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the European Union to be considerably increased in the medium term, can only be welcomed.
But there may still be a threat from seeking compatibility with the internal market.
Waste is not a renewable natural resource, although there is more and more of it produced every day.
So this directive is unintentionally topical right now.
But I warmly support this proposal.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Rothe for an excellent report which is very timely this week when we are struggling with the crisis of climate change.
Promoting the use of electricity from renewable energy sources is a very worthwhile endeavour.
We need radical technological adaptation.
Instead, proposals related to energy are submitted one at a time and without much consistency.
I would like to conclude simply by mentioning three problems which have come up time and time again throughout this debate.
Furthermore, for the sake of coherence, the targets I have mentioned when converted into national parameters must be binding or else the directive will lack content and substance.
For the same reason we can accept Amendment No 3, in part, but not Amendment No 7, which is too technical to be included in the text of the proposal.
However, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot accept the parts which prejudice the application of rules on state aid.
The next item is the report (A5-0308/2000) by Mrs Theorin, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on participation of women in peaceful conflict resolution (2000/2025(INI)).
While formal peace processes are almost exclusively a male domain, international experience and declarations show the importance of women' s participation in resolving conflicts and building peace.
Decisions on implementing relief programmes are the responsibility of crisis teams, and the specialist knowledge and expertise of women is often not recognised or not given due respect by such teams.
They obviously want to keep their powerful position in matters of foreign policy and defence for themselves, yet feel that men can promote women' s interests.
Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my interest in this report and to underscore its excellence.
Furthermore, there must be financial resources to help women who are victims of this situation.
Mr President, a great deal has already been said and I am not about to lapse into repetition.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Theorin on her excellent own-initiative report, which deals with an important and topical issue, i.e. how the fundamental participation of women in negotiations to resolve conflicts can change the world and turn the dominant culture of confrontation and violence into a culture of peace, dialogue and democratic conflict resolution.
I therefore support the demands made in the report for women to be given the right to diplomatic influence.
This is a very well informed, in-depth, and rigorous report, which is capable of stating fundamental principles with the clarity demonstrated in Paragraph 17. It is audacious but, at the same time, contains considerable practical sense and very necessary proposals.
I for my part want to condemn all rape and all slavery.
The fifth point is the role of ECHO, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office, which has been invited by Parliament to help evaluate the gender dimension.
The problem is that millions of people, particularly women, undertake this type of work, and there is a huge demand for it, but it is not subject to any regulations whatsoever.
I believe the best thing to do would be to spur the Member States on to regulate the sector, via the employment guidelines, as has already been called for in Parliament' s opinion on these guidelines.
The immigrant population is usually a significant group in this sector, and this requires special measures, such as specialised reception centres, which provide the necessary assistance.
This is an issue for the Member States.
Demand has risen many times over in recent years, and yet this fact has scarcely been taken into account in general working life and as regards the rights and duties involved.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
(Sustained applause)
Not only are we to create the internal system of freedom and peace, but also harmonise it with the rules and customs that the European Community and the European Union have maintained for decades.
The first step ahead of us in a bid to restructure the federal state constitutionally is to define a framework for the broadest possible democratic dialogue about the character of relations between the two republics.
You, the representatives of the European Parliament, who directly represent the citizens of its member countries, the citizens of Europe, are best placed to understand why the very possibility of entry into Europe seems extremely uncertain to us, the citizens of the present-day Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Let us resume our session.
This is a very important matter for the public, and one that is of interest to them, and it would be only right to get a decision on the matter this afternoon.
The latter then announced that it would produce a concrete proposal within six months, and it has kept its word.
At the moment in the European Union there already exists the practice of public access to documentation, and we should remember that brave citizens and many progressive Member States have been fighting for increased transparency for many years.
Parliament still needs to work on this report more, and for that reason I believe that it must be improved upon still here.
We are glad that the report repeats a crucial principle that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control also vehemently support.
Now, they will be given the opportunity also to acquire some insight into circumstances which do not receive the special attention of the mass media and special interest groups and, in that way, they will be better able to participate in the open and democratic debate which is so important to confidence in the EU.
The Committee on Petitions would like to see shorter waiting periods before documents are released.
As soon as confidentiality is no longer justified, the document must naturally be made publicly accessible.
I would also like to emphasise that all citizens must be guaranteed access to documents in as many forms as possible.
The doctrine of political responsibility must not be confused with the citizens' rights to openness.
I would therefore urge the rapporteurs to delete any reference to the rights of parliamentarians from the provision concerning public access to documents, and I call upon all my fellow delegates to make very sure that their interests are not played off against those of the public.
Access to documents is not guaranteed in these sectors and is denied not only to the citizens, but even to the European Parliament. Moreover, Parliament is neither kept formally informed nor consulted regarding fundamental documents.
But one serious cause for regret remains.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Cashman for the splendid work he has done on this report.
This is a very important report, which forms an important part of what we might call the EU's new principle of public access to official documents.
(Technical disruption)
It is not just a matter of the principle of unrestricted access to all documents but also, of course, of finally managing to open the doors of Council meetings, so that in future the Council can no longer take lonely decisions in camera à la Metternich and then go in for cheap 'Brussels bashing' .
Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the work on derogations.
Our people regard Europe as being undemocratic, a place where decisions are taken behind closed doors.
In accordance with Article 255 of the Treaty, the proposed regulation must be adopted before 1 May 2001, that is to say, two years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I now wish to address certain problems that currently prevent the Commission from accepting certain amendments.
As I pointed out previously, in certain cases we can agree in principle to the amendments, but we have to work together from a technical and administrative point of view, for example with regard to the amendments referring to the classification of documents and the register.
We have no written document before us and, in future too, I would like the Commission to inform the Members of its recommendations in writing.
Welcome
We welcome the enhanced status accorded to credit risk mitigation, particularly the collateral which may be offered by small businesses.
Report (A5-0321/2000) tabled by Mr Blokland, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the incineration of waste [C5-0371/2000 - 1998/0289(COD)]
Mr President, might I ask the Liberal Group - I am also asking in my capacity as one of the co-rapporteurs - to take a slightly more pragmatic approach?
It is therefore a joint request from the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists to postpone the vote until November II.
I therefore move that we postpone the vote on the Villiers report until the November II part-session.
I followed the order established by the sessional services and the House did not make any changes.
As President on duty today, I have to tell you that, as your fellow Member, all I can say is that I agree with you.
Apart from the negativity which they demonstrated during the first stage, when the European Parliament called attention to the risks in Great Britain, action during the second stage, when the crisis was at its height in Great Britain, was basically limited to that country, and there was no immediate programme of strict controls or attempt to restructure animal feedingstuffs at pan-European level.
That is why we want to learn four major lessons which should be borne in mind for the future.
- (FR) We voted in favour of this joint resolution.
. (PT) The growing number of cases in Britain of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the current situation in France have placed the 'mad cow' or BSE issue even more firmly on the agenda.
For fear of spreading panic among the citizens or with a view to avoiding commercial disasters, certain governments did not provide the Commission with the necessary information quickly enough or did not immediately call a halt to consumption of the products in question or ban their export at the first signs of danger.
The farmers cannot tackle this crisis without help: we need to draw up a support plan for stock-farmers and introduce measures to restore consumer confidence.
Because of the inability of all the European institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, to define an appropriate Community policy that responds to the safety needs of the Member States most directly concerned, problems will arise in deciding whether it is the constraints of the single market or the health and safety needs of our people that come first.
After extensive discussion with the Council, we achieved what we wanted on several points.
The days of landfill sites are now coming to an end and must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies.
social agencies, especially representatives of the vulnerable groups targeted by the programme, are involved in the procedures,
Indeed, while we welcome the return to growth and the fall in unemployment, we must not close our eyes to the fact that inequalities are still with us, if not getting worse.
I believe that the rapporteur is right when he calls for greater participation of public authorities, social partners and civil society in measures to defeat poverty and social exclusion at this time.
The 'working poor' , most of them women, working part-time, for a pittance and in the most insecure jobs, join the trail of poverty so loftily ignored in the official speeches about economic recovery.
Three years ago, the Prime Minister set up the Social Exclusion Unit which coordinates government action to reduce social exclusion by producing joined up solutions to joined up problems.
We now have a plant with more than 60 rotors, taking up as much land as 1000 football pitches.
At present, the Union is dependent on outside supplies for about 50% of its energy, and that figure may well rise to 70% by the year 2020 unless we develop renewable energy sources.
Obviously we have to observe more progressive and effective safety and security rules when using nuclear energy and when storing nuclear waste.
So we must go in search of energy that is already present in nature, but which has remained unused because no one has developed the technology to tap into it.
The preparation of ASEM IV must be used as an opportunity to set out our requirements for democracy, on the one hand, by ensuring that the elected assembles and civil society are kept informed and able to intervene - which involves, in particular, the establishment of a social forum - and, on the other hand, by adhering fully to social, environmental and human rights.
The Central American parliament appears to have recently been the subject of certain misunderstandings and even criticism.
We saw that Parlacen was going through the same changes that this Parliament went through at the beginning, since it had to fight and continues to fight to have more competences, more resources and more presence and to be recognised as representative.
The Central American Parliament, like the European Parliament, must gain prestige, credibility and legitimacy on the basis of the activity of its political groups, because the life of the parties is, or at least should be, a faithful reflection of the societies they represent.
With regard to human rights, we have, since 1990, been supporting the cooperation programmes in favour of respect for human rights by means of education and raising awareness in this area.
(B5-0855/2000) by Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
The extreme confusion that has characterised the electoral process over recent weeks in Côte d'Ivoire, which had looked like a model economy until now, is symptomatic of a country in crisis, reflected by an economy in crisis, social despair and, consequently, political chaos.
The political, military and religious leaders must pull out all the stops to make national reconciliation possible.
The debate on nationality Ivoirian - that confused debate that tends solely towards introducing discrimination in favour of a country' s own nationality, something we are combating in our own countries, and whose logical conclusion is the practice of ethnic cleansing - must be used to totally oppose any reference or connotation to Ivoirian nationality and to have these removed from the Ivoirian constitution.
He also supported the amendment to the constitution, with the intention of cutting out his most significant opponent, Watara, on the grounds that one of his parents is not an Ivoirian national.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even if Côte d'Ivoire used to be a bastion of stability and democracy compared to other states in western and central Africa, for a long time now it has seen ethnic and religious tensions and, most recently, the abuse of power by the former government under President Bedié, which eventually led to the violent military coup.
We condemn the ethnic violence and in particular the political leaders who fomented it with their demagogic rhetoric.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
The forthcoming EU/ASEAN meeting in Laos in December offers us a crucial opportunity to demonstrate our condemnation of this regime in the strongest terms.
In any case, I would not trust our own ministers to raise the matter there.
ASEAN has become, in every sense of the word, a paper tiger in its failure to deal with the awful events in Burma.
The junta has said that it is their intention to try and smash the party as a whole.
It is historically charged and naturally it is an awkward situation.
These slight improvements - which we certainly do not owe to the author of the Socialist Group amendments, Mr Sakellariou - have come about over the last few years and given rise to a situation that is certainly no longer tragic but that remains disastrous and in any case still is no match for the real issues of modern-day Vietnam.
Mr Swoboda, the European Parliament is flexible and efficient.
It would be better still though, if the President were not just to concentrate on reinforcing mutual cooperation, when he visits Hanoi, but if he were to make this very cooperation conditional on the extraction of firm promises from Vietnam to drastically improve the prevailing lamentable human rights situation.
I urge the Council and the Commission to protest in robust terms against this flagrant abuse of freedom of worship by the Vietnamese authorities.
Furthermore, the process has led to the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Commission and Vietnam in 1995.
Of course those are points that were contained in the motion for a resolution we tabled.
I agree that we need to do all that we can to assist them, but we would help most by changing the situation that has caused their misery and that of countless others throughout the world.
The issues that are being discussed are for the medium and long-term.
Mr President, Commissioner, the floods which have affected various areas of northern Italy and other European countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland and France in recent weeks once again raise the issue for Parliament both of an extraordinary, urgent intervention to alleviate the distress of the people, communities and companies affected, and a longer term policy to prevent the repetition of natural disasters of this scale.
Given its anticipated continuous growth - of more than 38% in the next decade - the transport sector will be that which requires the more important measures.
The debate is closed.
Perhaps that is established practice here in Parliament, but I think it is very chancy to give the impression that the European Parliament as an institution is committing itself on a subject such as this one and considering entrusting the Commission with this kind of task, given the very low attendance here.
(Parliament rejected the request for deferral).
The economic and social policy of the ÅU, which has resulted in the reduced purchasing power of and facilities available to workers, as regards the payment of contributions, the emergence of new diseases and the unaccountability of pharmaceutical companies, have caused health costs to spiral.
For the rest, this opens the door wide to private insurers, on condition only that they do not (from the outset) select the patient and the insurance premiums by type of disease.
People who do not earn or spend much no longer count for anything.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased to be able to speak today in the presence of a group of visitors from my lovely constituency, whom I welcome very warmly.
However, that also means that these institutions must be given enough time to prepare for the new rules.
The report refers to a growing consensus that the present framework fails adequately to capture the changes in the financial sector over the past ten years.
We are in favour of putting more emphasis on risk mitigation techniques; and we are also in favour of broadening the basic concept of the Basel Committee.
We also think that this report makes an important and satisfactory contribution to the whole process.
And finally, and this is a key point, we are entirely alert to the fact that we ought to respect the institutional balance established in the Treaty.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Before I finish, Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the rapporteur, Mr Söderman, and congratulate him on his work on fighting maladministration and thereby also bringing European citizens closer to the life of the Community institutions.
Mr President, in accordance with the Nordic public service tradition, the European Parliament has, positively enough, claimed that the Ombudsman's position should be strengthened and consolidated.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
After all, access to documentation is a fundamental civil right and no documentation is more important to a candidate than documentation in relation to examinations.
We thought it legitimate for candidates to have access to their marked test papers, since access to documents is a fundamental right and one that is also recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights we adopted this week.
And that is how it should be.
The example should be followed by all other institutions and bodies, as the Committee on Petitions has recommended.
Citizens of the European Union should receive a positive impression when encountering the Community institutions.
And the something new in this case is that it must apply best practices and avoid anything which experience tells us will damage its credibility within the Member States.
With regard to other institutions, it is they themselves who will decide whether the procedures proposed in this report or in the requests by the Ombudsman are adopted.
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
If they are prevented by some unavoidable catastrophe that is a breach of democracy, but if they do not bother coming, they do not deserve the vote.
I endorse the criteria of greater prudence adopted, but other aspects of the matter must also be taken into consideration, particularly the solvency ratio, which is a weighting factor according to the type of counter-party used to estimate the credit risk associated with a bank's assets.
Provisional establishment of the European Police College (EPC)
This police cooperation is crucial if we are to achieve the very important objective of affording European citizens a high degree of security within the European area of freedom, security and justice.
The enlargement of the European Union, which will extend the space in which citizens are free to move, should be accompanied by supplementary measures ensuring safety and peaceful co-existence among the Member States.
From what I see, conditions in French and Portuguese jails are very different.
In other words, if you want common standards, you have to start by defining these. Otherwise, you end up with training that may be completely different in form from area to area.
However, Mr Posselt's work has resulted in provision at last being made for police training to include human rights and the right of defence, and the proposal is also important and appropriate at the moment to create a virtual police college which would take advantage of the potential offered by the Internet.
But here we are in Strasbourg in a near-deserted Chamber hearing that which is almost unbelievable.
It is a good idea and in the European Union where people have freedom of movement, freedom of trade and the right of establishment, where travellers from Scotland can go to Sicily or Greece, it is only logical to expect to develop a common system of maintaining the rule of law.
In the Netherlands, the police are trained in the de-escalation of conflicts and in repressive tolerance whereby the existence of subcultures and ethnic minorities, the organisation of political protest and the use of churches as ports of refuge for illegal immigrants are seen as normal social phenomena.
Whoever believes that the solutions that they advocate are good should not have anything to fear from exposure to other people' s solutions.
I hope that, in this area, the College will provide a starting point for the future.
This is a good illustration of what we are starting to call 'Network Europe' , a Europe which puts nations in contact with each other directly, without the need to maintain pointless superstructures.
Most of the cases of child abduction are actually handled very efficiently and appropriately by the central authorities in all Member States.
It is therefore crucial that this loophole must be plugged for reasons of fairness, of realism given the way society is changing and for the sake of equal rights and obligations for all of the European Union' s citizens.
Meantime, we welcome this measure and we will vote heartily for it.
Because we support the goal that has been set, we are voting for the proposed measures.
The point about the one day clearly refers to people who often travel right across the world to see a child.
The European Parliament' s statements on this matter and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, confirm the validity of the approach adopted by the Commission.
I know that FIFA have played for time already and has waited far too long before coming up with any response to the Commission's formal statement issued back in 1998.
It is only natural that the member of the Commission responsible for sports should represent the Union in WADA in the future.
UK decision to impose a levy on non-British hauliers
Ireland, is obviously a very small but open market, yet most of what we buy comes from the United Kingdom.
In conclusion, we are being premature in the European Parliament in holding this debate, but I welcome the fact and the statement from Commissioner Vitorino which clearly indicates that the UK government has the right to introduce a euro-vignette system provided it keeps within the rules and regulations already in place.
Mr President, taxes and tolls are obviously sensitive matters, and I can confirm this specifically on behalf of Austria where we are always having this discussion and where, of course, good traffic solutions are constantly being sought.
This is not discriminating against every other driver or road haulier in Europe to the benefit of British drivers.
He is paying over the odds for his vignette unless there is some special dispensation on a per diem basis.
On 22 November, the very day of the 25th anniversary of the coronation of King Juan Carlos, which paved the way to democracy in Spain, one of the key figures in this democracy has, in turn, paid with his life for his belief in freedom, tolerance and respect for the rights of others.
So please keep them safe until then.
The European Union negotiating position concentrated on safeguarding the environmental integrity of the Kyoto protocol in the areas of land-use change and forestry, the "sinks" issue, the relation between the Kyoto mechanism and domestic action, known as "supplementarity" , and compliance.
With a view to preparing this next session, the EU should not reopen discussions on all issues, but focus on key priorities, notably "sinks" mechanisms, "supplementarity" and a strong compliance regime.
Mr Prescott is now holed below the water line and we do not know how long he will remain afloat.
My final comment is that I find it right and proper that you have remained firm on the issue of "sinks" , primarily because it is extremely difficult to measure "sinks" accurately.
Nuclear energy has no chance of making a comeback.
But we must press on, and equality must be incorporated in Bonn, in May 2001.
We will still need to find a compromise of this kind at the follow-up conference due to take place in May 2001, in Bonn.
The challenge facing us in the issue of climate change is clearly one of the greatest challenges in the 21st century, if we are all to have a planet to live on in the future.
The same applies to the partial inclusion of the CO2 sinks, such as the additional planting of forests.
The Conference in The Hague is to be resumed, as you have informed us, Commissioner, next spring in Bonn.
Madam President, thank you, Commissioner Wallström, for your intervention.
If there is one area in which there has been no lack of unity, it is in this relationship.
Failing to achieve an agreement at the next COP6 meeting is not an option.
We were very constructive and we negotiated until the last minute of these talks in The Hague.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have the floor.
Some countries still have major problems regarding the coordination of social security systems, tax, asylum, visa and immigration matters and trade negotiations on services - a very important issue.
Let me add that we have not yet reached agreement on the distribution of seats in the European Parliament.
Finding an agreement which will enable the Union to operate after the new accessions currently in active preparation is vital for the future of the European Union and indeed the enlarged Union.
Your President is invited, of course.
It will be forwarded to Nice, where we naturally hope it will be endorsed.
You can see that we have a very full discussion programme for Nice.
In a Union of 27 or more Member States, the unanimity requirement will, quite simply, paralyse progress in every area where it is maintained.
You spoke of codecision by the European Parliament.
(Applause)
That challenge is the reunification of our old continent; that challenge is an enlargement unparalleled in scale and that is what Nice must prepare us for.
Madam President, the most important aim of the Nice Summit is enlargement of the European Union and the EU' s preparation for this enlargement.
Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I do not believe that the Governments of the 15 Member States have covered themselves in glory.
This is not an appropriate method.
It is now proposed that decisions should be made by qualified majority voting in 49 of these areas.
Majority decision-making will destroy the right of veto for the Member States as parliamentary democracies, but the EU will not itself become a parliamentary democracy.
Mr President, Europe needs leadership, clarity, choices and decisiveness.
We do not find the principle of blackmailing into proclamation acceptable with regard to the conclusions the Biarritz European Council, even if it was an informal one.
Yes, we do think that the Nice Council conclusions should include a request that the Commission should draw up a framework directive in this field.
I shall adopt a position on the Treaty of Nice when I see the outcome of the negotiations, but there is a somewhat schizophrenic feel to the debates here.
In Amsterdam, the Heads of State and Government failed their exams, and now they have to go to Nice to resit them.
If the disparity between the large and the small members of the Council becomes too great, we face the risk of a legitimacy crisis within the European Union in a few years' time, because the small countries will no longer feel comfortable in the Council, fearing that they might become unable to defend their own identity.
The French President and the First Minister seem to be more obsessed with their own political future than with that of Europe.
In failing to incorporate the text into the Treaty and only subscribing to it in political terms, we are opening the door to major problems of legal interpretation.
On the other hand, I would stress the considerable importance of providing our Europe with strong institutions to fill the institutional void being created by progress on the economic front with the euro.
The stated aim of this review is to design more efficient institutions which will be able to cope with an enlarged Europe and, at the same time, to reduce the democratic deficit which certainly exists.
But it also means restructuring the Committee 133 itself: making it far more accountable; ensuring that its agenda and conclusions are accessible and that its composition is broad and inclusive.
Mr President, I am speaking not just to the President-in-Office of the Council but also to all the governments of the Member States when I say that if agreement is not reached in Nice on these difficult issues those issues will not go away.
The working of the codecision procedure over the last year shows that it works.
So I think that, as a first move, it should already be agreed that trade policy needs to come under qualified majority voting.
As a seven year-old girl she was forced to flee her country before the advance of the Red Army, a fugitive hiding in ditches to avoid being strafed by Soviet aircraft.
Mr Méndez de Vigo has just made reference to the Charter, and rightly so.
We can expect no better of him.
As the days go by, it is becoming ever likelier that the agreement the ministers will reach, while not representing the lowest common denominator, will be a rather low common denominator, indeed a very low common denominator.
Mr President, I wish firstly to thank the Members of the European Parliament for a very high standard of debate.
So it is not at all a case of not proclaiming it, and it is not a problem of transparency.
Equal rotation affects big countries too, as actually at any given time they might not have a commissioner, just like everyone else.
I think Parliament will be able to witness the establishment of the improved institutional mechanisms needed to handle the future development of the European Union which unites us all.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Mr President, I should like to endorse Mr Van Orden's statement.
I am totally opposed to anyone at all threatening an invited Minister, even a Turkish one.
It goes without saying that we in this house of European democracy must guarantee the safety of all our guests and anyone who spends time within these four walls.
On the grounds that pills do no harm and that "Marijuana is a treatment for tumours", the Minister for Health undermined the dignity of the individual by calling for the drug to be legalised.
This is, at the very least, poor manners with regard to the European Parliament, if not an outright snub, and, allowing for the possibility that the Members of the European Parliament have nothing to say about human rights, even though they have voted, by a very large majority, in favour of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, they will be absent from this European Union forum which many of them attended last year in order to debate with NGOs and institutions.
We have now said enough on that score.
In point of fact, before Amsterdam both the European Parliament and the Commission took the view that it would be best to have a Vice-President of the Commission with responsibility for foreign policy who would also assume the role of the High Representative and would have a special obligation to and link with the Council.
On 15 June before the Feira Summit, the European Parliament passed a resolution, and tomorrow, on the eve of the Nice Council, it has to vote on a text summarising its position.
The development of the ESDP is a major new departure for the European project and therefore needs to have the existing institutional framework clarified.
At Nice, the European Council is due to adopt several decisions, which I shall now discuss.
For the first debate, at the beginning of next year, the Commission will draw up a scoreboard, country by country, for the past budgetary year, which will show the current state of commitments, payments, and outstanding amounts for the main programmes funded by the Community budget and by the EDF.
We also applied ourselves to the issue of regional cooperation, an idea that met with a degree of resistance from the countries in the region that do not wish to be locked into a past from which they have broken free, and I think I can say that, as a result of this summit, they understood that there was no contradiction between regional cooperation and their progress and rapprochement in relation to the European Union, largely through the stabilisation and association process which was confirmed and laid down on that occasion.
Previously, a summit was held with India, under the Portuguese Presidency, and a ministerial meeting will be taking place with ASEAN.
This is not, however, going to put us off.
I would remind you of the wide range of tasks that this covers: humanitarian aid, the evacuation of nationals, conflict prevention and also the separation by force of the warring parties.
It is underpinned, of course, by the independence of the European Union' s decision making and by the acknowledgement of the voluntary and political nature of the commitments that have been given.
He has done more than most as a personalised version of conflict resolution in a part of the world which I know well and has been properly commended globally for his efforts.
I find some of the coverage that the creation of this force has received in the country I know best quite extraordinary.
I would like to thank the honourable lady, Madame Lalumière, for highlighting the report on conflict prevention, which the Commission is preparing together with the High Representative for the Nice European Council.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
That will be the real test for the European Union in my view.
Impatient citizens complain that the wheels of European bureaucracy turn infinitely slowly.
However, citizens too must, as far as possible, be given access to information and documents.
It is still completely unclear in the current proposals as to what that role should be.
If you fly a European flag on your car, you can go anywhere, even into the most miserable refugee camp.
That is why I believe that Europe must decide to act now.
If we as Europeans cannot play a responsible role in the resolution of this conflict, independently of the United States, we must assume that we shall not be trusted to act as a mediator in any other regional conflicts either.
However, your personal commitment must not be seen as a substitute for democratic legitimisation of the European security and defence policy.
I cannot accept certain details of Mrs Lalumière' s report, and in the final vote I shall support its rejection.
Neglect of this wide range of instruments of non-military conflict prevention would turn out to be a mistake in the long run, and in that respect I am dissatisfied with the Council's statements to the effect that we have already taken decisions, but that things will move in this general direction.
As I am sure you will have understood, we intend to vote against both reports and we promise to fight tooth and nail against policies which express ...
Thirdly, a nuclear-free corridor, such as Olaf Palme once suggested, should be created from the Baltic to the Black Sea.
Could I congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her report.
Mr Brok' s report also discusses the post of High Representative for the CFSP.
What a pity, I say to my colleagues Van Orden and others, because my colleagues just across the pond, the Irish Sea, have so much to offer in this area: the tradition, the experience and the practice.
The European Parliament, working together with the national parliaments, is, in my opinion, the most appropriate body for this task.
I believe that the lessons we learn in this latest development will serve us well in the future as we come to terms with the need to establish a European defence policy and capability, which in my view is as much an essential component of European integration as is the single currency.
I also think that the European Union has the specific ability to combine these various instruments and that what we must do, if this policy progresses and becomes consolidated, is to develop a genuine European culture of conflict prevention and management.
I believe we will see a positive dialogue developing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resignation of the Commission in March 1999 highlighted the need to reform its structures and working methods.
Although it may be led from the top, the reform must be clear and visible to the unions, to all the staff, who must be effectively associated in this whole process.
That measure will take time, but it is inevitable and crucial to the reform.
The reform of the Commission is crucial to the future of our institutions.
In drawing up my report, I have been able to study not only the White Paper, but also the second report of the committee of independent experts and the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 19 January, proposed by Michiel van Hulten, on the work of the aforementioned committee of experts.
The Court of Auditors indicates in its report that it is not opposed to the removal of prior approval provided that it is replaced by other procedures, which offer guarantees that are at least equivalent, and can thereby involve parties other than the financial controller.
Big organisations everywhere now are becoming more open; they are becoming more transparent; they are using information technology in new ways; they are moving away from traditional vertical forms of organisation, sharing information across organisations and between each other.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite its scope the contents of the White Paper presented by Mr Kinnock do not directly raise any institutional topics.
We discussed that during this afternoon's debate on the common foreign policy.
Finally, we must deal with the thorny issue of the proposal on early retirement.
The de-centralisation of financial control to DGs is an important step but it will only work if staff are properly trained, if sufficient resources are available, and if the responsibility of line managers is properly enforced.
An institution and its directors must have clear scope for the best possible administrative practices.
As for disciplinary procedures, pledges have been made here too, but no clear rules have been formulated so far, nor have we seen or heard any clear statements as to how such rules would be enforced, nor has the question of external agencies been conclusively resolved.
This process of transformation is necessary to be able to truly serve God and cannot be enforced by rules.
As in the case of anything new which changes established situations, care and precision are clearly necessary.
We shall however be withdrawing Amendment No 6 and asking for a split vote on the latter part of Amendment No 15 as we do not believe the current system within the ECB lends itself to this situation.
When I was previously in this Parliament, the President of the Commission was Jacques Delors and he worked alongside Commissioner Brittan and before him Commissioner Cockfield.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we are monitoring this reform with justifiably high expectations.
Issues such as the BSE crisis, oil prices, and the greenhouse effect have a distinctly European dimension.
The public must also be able to feel that the Commission is truly accessible and transparent.
For the European Parliament, reform is a vital matter on which it has decisive effect as a budgetary authority and as a legislature.
It defines many clear procedures in several channels for reporting alleged wrong-doing inside and outside an official's employing institution.
I am therefore sure that we will have the pleasure of hearing you in the future.
Let me say briefly, Mr Garriga Polledo, that the categories used in the Financial Regulation have been retained.
The staff of the Commission are also agents of the reform process, so it has to meet with their acceptance too.
We believe that a cosmetic reform makes no sense in these times of profound change.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by emphasising the quality of Mrs Sauquillo's own-initiative report on the reform of the Commission and its impact on the effectiveness of the European Union's relations with the developing countries.
We want to work towards a culture of greater accountability.
Before we start to talk about aid to projects, we should try to remove all the existing causes of exploitation, identifying and bringing to justice those who have exploited and abused peoples which are in a state of need.
It is precisely because Mr Nielson is loyal to that collegiate responsibility that he will doubtless defend the proposal tonight.
What seems to us even more serious in the Commission' s proposal is the territorial separation, which is maintained.
In 2001, for instance, financial responsibilities will be deconcentrated to 22 delegations, 15 more delegations will see their computer facilities upgraded and 40 additional posts of officials will be allocated to external services.
Safety at sea
But the Erika and the Ievoli Sun were not French ships.
In fact, it has been among the highest priority items on the Commission's agenda ever since the fatal sinking of the Erika 11 months ago.
We hope and expect that the Transport Council, on 21 December, will add their part to the common determination among the European institutions to bring about a real improvement in maritime safety by the adoption of common positions on all three texts.
I think it is within sight but we need to be sure that this agreement will be enforced.
I understand and I welcome the minister's efforts to expedite these two reports as quickly as possible and I therefore consider that, in principle, his proposal to discuss the matter, if possible in December, is a positive one.
As a result of all of this, we have drawn up a parliamentary report amending the directive, which suggests improvements in various aspects aimed at strengthening the classification system, as a means and a valid tool for guaranteeing the safety of maritime traffic.
However, the legacy of the years when materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us, often with very severe consequences.
To this end, publication of information is a vital component in the establishment of a way for the general public to obtain information, emergency phone contact numbers, etc.
I expect a great deal from the second series of proposals and from the establishment of a European maritime safety agency.
I believe your intentions are honourable, but we can only discuss negotiating outcomes that have been examined by the Council.
We know, of course, that port state control has not been a potent guarantor of maritime safety in the past, we know that the classification societies have not all discharged their duties as shipping inspectorates properly and conscientiously and that some of them have tended to be slipshod, and we know that tankers without double hulls are floating time bombs.
We are working to establish new credibility; we should not jeopardise it by letting the Commission take the wrong course of action.
Those who are not prepared to take on this responsibility must stay out of our waters and our ports.
The Watts report intensifies the measures against ships posing serious risks or flying flags of convenience without abolishing them altogether.
Nonetheless, I am delighted that the Commission proposals have taken on board the main demands formulated by the elected representatives of the coastal regions: the banning of single-hull oil tankers, strengthening port controls, and the assessment of classification societies.
I also support his demand for compulsory voyage data recorders.
The guarantees of the seaworthiness of vessels required that considerable measures be adopted on the societies responsible and on inspections, as has already been said.
In short, measures are an informal way of trying to bring safety to the desired standard.
Everyone has stated - and I absolutely agree - that the current 25% inspection rate necessary for port state control has not been achieved yet.
The time has long gone for simple compromises, which some, moreover, are saying will be difficult to achieve.
As far as the classification societies are concerned, it is my duty and my wish to re-emphasise on this occasion that the main focal point of the present discussion seems to be liability.
It is important to tighten up regulations regarding the control of harbours and ports even further, and enhance its effectiveness.
Laxness towards large companies is indeed a sign that they are more powerful than elected institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearly the issue of safety at sea, in other words, the safety of human life and environmental protection, is a very serious issue.
The reports that have been presented are a move in this direction.
We agree with imposing a lower limit for personal injury or death and material damage, leaving the Member States free to raise these limits.
Presenting new technologies and making improvements to the vessel design are part of this important work.
We must move forward towards consensus upon maximum maritime regulation and safety.
I am glad to say that the Commission will support many of the amendments put forward in these three reports.
The Commission can accept Amendment Nos 6, 7 and 8, but can only partially accept Amendment No 1.
It is expected that the IMO will formally adopt the phase out schedule at its April meeting next year.
The Commission' s task is to confirm that the classification society continues to meet the qualitative criteria in the directive and to monitor the performance of the classification societies.
The Commission appreciates the support for its originally proposed limit.
Once again, this demonstrates how urgent the adoption of strengthened, preventative and restoratory Community measures for the protection of our seas is.
Mr Turco, I have understood what you had to say and I will give the matter some thought.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Madam President, I should like to move that the amendment be altered so that it begins with the words "urges, in this respect, the Council and the Commission".
Report (A5-0329/2000) by Mr Pomés Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the White Paper on reforming the Commission (aspects concerning the Committee on Budgetary Control) [COM(2000)0200 - C5-0445/2000 - 2000/2215(COS)]
McKenna report (A5-0336/2000)
The unaccountability of shipowners is being bolstered by the privatisation of shipping registers, which shipowners now control, and by the lack of any basic inspection controls or other form of involvement on the part of government authorities.
I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteurs Watts, Vachetta and Piétrasanta have endeavoured to close the gaps still present in the Commission proposal.
The responsibility for putting these measures in place rests therefore with the Member States.
We must not allow single-hull tankers to carry on sailing in our waters when they are no longer present elsewhere after 2005, 2010 or 2015.
Yet Mr Hatzidakis makes proposals which restrict the scope of the Commission proposals.
Promoting more stringent regulations at an international level must continue to be the fundamental objective of our maritime safety policy.
It is particularly important that it is made clear that the polluter-pays principle must apply in full.
This Community action must be accompanied by the reactivation of the IMO which, endowed with genuine police power to enforce the International Safety Management Code, would be an effective instrument on a par with Interpol.
As long as it costs less to transgress rules than it does to comply with them, companies that have maximum profits in their sights will carry on making the wrong choices.
Preparation for the Nice European Council
Instead of raising human and social rights to a higher level, the Charter will make it easier to bring them down.
Unfortunately though, I do not see any evidence of this notion in the motions for resolutions.
While, like many others, I have at times during this semester regretted that we have heard so little from Prime Minister Jospin himself due to reasons of 'cohabitation' , I am aware of the strong impetus he has always given to his ministers and I should like to state as much.
In the social sphere, the proposals are too timid and do not even effectively flesh out the commitments adopted at the Lisbon Summit, particularly as regards the need for strengthening economic and social cohesion.
In this sense, no decision about the development of the EU should be taken which risks alienating the citizens of Europe.
British people want reform of the EU to make it more accountable and more efficient.
This text uses the future (and ever more distant) enlargement of the European Union as a pretext to call for the reinforcement of a system which has already run out of steam.
Now, there are squabbles not only between the 'larger' and the 'smaller' but among the 'larger' too.
. (SV) We welcome and support the report, which touches on many important trends in the development of the common foreign and security policy.
As every year, this ritual report prepared by the European Parliament, which is in principle devoted to the annual general budget of the CFSP, employs the well-known method of gradual shifts which work on a federalist crevice found in a given area in order to extend this breach with scant regard for the Treaties or the decisions of the European Councils.
While chatting to me he learnt that a military force of the States of Europe is being organised, a force ready to intervene to keep the peace in and around Europe.
Nor, furthermore, is it a task for the European Parliament to define what capacity a European rapid reaction force should possess and whether or not it should, for example, include a capacity for intervention by air and sea.
Future conflicts will not be solved through military intervention but rather via a policy for social, economic and ecological justice.
We are radically opposed to this European army as we are to NATO and to our own national army.
For example, the wording is far too far-reaching in respect of CESDP and NATO, in respect of the use of "threats of the use of force" as a means of applying pressure in conflict prevention activities, which directly contravenes the UN Charter.
Now, in the decade following the upheavals in the East, we think that, with these reports, 'the European peace project' is sending an unhelpful signal to the applicant States.
A mere six of these paragraphs contain statements relating to the title of the report.
Sadly, there is clearly an aim at overriding national abortion laws or even punishing or suppressing faith traditions opposing abortion.
Many tens of thousands of women in the European Union who provide domestic help in the informal sector of the economy would no doubt be delighted that we are dealing with the regulation of such activity, if only they knew.
Smet proposes, amongst other things, that a European definition of domestic work be introduced.
The needs of domestic workers should be considered when employment legislation is being drafted.
They have given their pension contributions to the various national governments, which have quickly made them vanish like clever magicians.
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group forcefully recalls that the citizens of the European Union expect more than ever that reform measures and staff recruitment must take account of the diversity of opinions and convictions which are expressed in our countries.
As far as human resources are concerned, the quality of employees and greater transparency in staffing policy in general must become the strong points of the new administrative reform.
During this explanation of vote, I must emphasise the fact that Parliament does not, unfortunately, have all the powers it should have.
I would like to close with a procedural motion.
The reports are certainly contradictory, Mr Barón Crespo.
It is not what the Group of the Party of European Socialists wants.
That is exactly why we have a problem: this is an important summit and everything we say counts.
I must point out that the Committee is to meet tomorrow afternoon, firstly to try to really get to grips with what the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference were.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
I should be grateful if you would agree to that request.
I, personally, was horrified by the murder of a sympathiser on hunger strike by a detachment of the Grey Wolves in Rotterdam a few days ago.
This would have been completely unnecessary, of course, if the Council had taken more notice, or indeed any notice, of our first reading and the amended proposal from the Commission, which went some way towards our goal.
Thirdly, we must check whether the stipulations we approve will really help to improve the functioning of the internal market and whether they are commensurate with the goal to be achieved.
The second concern, of a specifically legal nature, has, on the other hand, encouraged us to increase the interdependence of the harmonisation of the market and the protection of health even further, by meticulously following the recommendations arising from the Court of Justice' s reasons for recently setting aside the Directive on advertising, reasons of which only a biased reading could lead one to conclude that the two aspects are incompatible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 80 fatalities in Europe from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Europe, its Council of Ministers, the Commission and Parliament decide to ban meat-and-bone meal and exclude cattle over 30 months' old from the food chain without prior testing.
We feel it is self-evident that Article 95 should form the legal basis for this directive together with Article 133, as the committee are now proposing in Amendment No 1.
The Court held that a total ban on tobacco advertising cannot be justified in the name of the proper functioning of the internal market.
I still feel that messages such as 'low-tar' , 'mild' and 'light' are misleading, so I will, in fact, oppose Amendments Nos 10 and 30.
I would also like to talk about the obligation inherent in the Treaties.
The rapporteur, Mr Maaten, has, with good reason, proposed reinforcing that legal basis with a reference to another article, Article 133 on external trade, and furthermore has proposed a series of amendments to some of the articles with the aim of preventing this directive being challenged on the basis of the case-law established by the judgment of the Court of Justice.
I am sorry that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also expressed opinions that the Court ban on tobacco advertising would in some way render this directive null and void.
Indeed, as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy I have been strongly lobbied by various groups about the need to regulate more strictly the sale and presentation of tobacco products in Europe.
Yet, ironically, I do not see in this directive any prohibition on growing tobacco within the Community - even when in countries such as Greece the tobacco grown is so strong that under this directive it would become a criminal offence to use it for manufacturing.
I also think there is reason to thank Mr Byrne for a very clear presentation of the legal basis.
More than half a million people die needlessly each year in the European Union and the number is set to grow if we do not act now.
This legal basis, too, is completely worthless in my opinion, and that is why the unions, companies and colleagues here are right to refer to job losses.
I want to see the photographic warning option, sensible listing of ingredients, Europe-wide research, health promotion measures to help children to remain smoke, tar, nicotine and addiction free.
There was also a readiness to compromise within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The exemption would apply to Article 3, as I understand the amendment, i.e. tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels.
Given the general nature of the directive, we cannot sever one from the other and, therefore, we have to strike it all down.
The creation of a maximum-sized warning label for some large packs would be a proportionate solution.
Finally, a total of 54 amendments have been tabled in the report and of these I am pleased to inform you that the Commission can accept 33, either totally or partially.
The main argument in favour of these amendments and of a report at the end of five years actually concerns enlargement of the European Union, which, following the Nice Summit, is particularly apposite and appropriate.
Summer time definitely seems to go hand-in-hand with better quality of life, as the positive effects of the summer time period are far more significant than the transitional problems linked to the change itself.
Summer time is not the problem for our common European House.
A one-off review by the Commission in five years' time will suffice.
There are also the requirements of manufacturers of computers or electronic tachographs and producers of calendars and diaries.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, medical research which is essential for patients must be approved quickly and with minimum bureaucracy, but at the same time ethical boundaries must be strictly respected and the subjects must be given maximum protection from abuse.
This is an important condition which we make here in our report.
So, although there are still some points of disagreement with the Council, I would like to remind you that the result we are seeking to obtain through the adoption of this directive is the outcome of lengthy and fruitful compromise negotiations between Mr Liese, our rapporteur, whom I thank and congratulate on his inclusive and constructive approach, and the Council, which has proved cooperative and open to the amendments adopted at second reading in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I am particularly thinking of cancer research, but there are many others.
Unfortunately, although the right measures are taken, they are unable to prevent new risks and diseases from emerging which the drugs available are unable to treat, and the medical community is obliged to find modern, more effective ways of meeting these challenges.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
What we have agreed with the Council and the Commission and, of course, with Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, so as to avoid a second reading and allow these programmes to continue without a break, thereby avoiding any gaps, is to extend the four programmes by two years, as the Commission has requested; however, the money will only be released a year at a time, so that if the new health programme is approved and enters into force in the meantime, there will be no need for an extension and the money can be used for the second year.
In general, it is high time the Member States agreed to give the European Union a greater margin of manoeuvre and a more substantial budget, on a legitimately supranational issue: diseases know no frontiers.
International organisations such as Europol have estimated that the importation of drugs into the Union is actually increasing.
Public health is national policy and should stay that way.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0355/2000) by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic with a view to adopting a Council Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal procedure [9650/2000 - C5-0392/00 - 2000/0813 (CNS)].
Another international initiative is the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power adopted by General Assembly Resolution 40/34 on 29 November 1985.
You may remember the debate on the so-called Di Pietro report, which was held here in this House some time ago.
This initiative targets three basic aspects: the victim' s right to information, access to justice and their right to compensation for damages.
However, the most significant aspect, in my opinion, is that people are finally becoming aware, at Union and other levels, of the need to change opinion on State intervention with regard to crimes.
Member States should be compelled to set up special police units for victims of crime.
Italy has repeatedly requested the extradition of this multiple murderer from France, where Mr Lojacono lives freely, so that he can finally serve his time.
The victim must always have priority.
As you noted, the draft framework decision contains three different types of measures: firstly, it enacts minimum rules with regard to the victim's rights; secondly, it enacts specific rules aiming to take into account the individual situation of those people who are victims of an offence in a Member State other than their State of origin and, thirdly, it encourages the States to develop measures for victim support.
It already works to support the networking at European level of the national services for victim support in order to ensure appropriate care of victims, particularly if they do not reside where the offence took place.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Mr Varela, chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, the committee responsible, has the floor again.
So well done everyone!
We put the final touches to a joint declaration by the Council and Parliament in a trilogue last Tuesday.
So, as you can see, we have cobbled together a solution for the 2001 budget.
We must consider internally how all the present requirements can be developed into transparent procedures in the area of promotions policy.
We asked what is was called and they said, "It is the unmentionable.
The Council has therefore proceeded to its second reading of the budget, taking account of the agreements concluded with the delegation from Parliament, with the ever-present desire to vote for a budget that will enable us to fund all of the European Union' s priorities and a budget that matches up to real needs and to our true ability to make use of appropriations.
The third important aspect of this Council second reading concerns the agreement reached on the allocation for the "Spirit of Enterprise" programme, which continues and complements the "Employment initiative" for the years 2001 to 2005.
More generally, I wish to emphasise that the budgetary procedure that will be completed in a few days has clearly demonstrated the interest in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999.
The discussions were at times frank, but were always relevant and underpinned by ongoing exchanges of views, which enabled us better to understand each other and therefore to more easily conclude an agreement, which I hope everyone will find satisfactory.
What is important is that no country in the Balkans will now be offered less aid than originally planned before developments in Serbia due to the democratisation of Serbia.
In fact, the repeated use, two years in a row, of the flexibility instrument could be considered, wrongly in my opinion, to be a form of revision of the financial perspective.
We have heard from the Council today that it is prepared to improve the record by 3.5%.
I would particularly like to extend warm thanks to the Commission and the Council for this.
Mr President, I would also like to thank Mrs Haug for her excellent work.
I suspect that, to put it simply, flexibility is for small amounts and revision is for large amounts, but we will see in the next few years how that will go.
We are now at the point at which we must decide whether or not we can vote in favour of this budget next Thursday.
But the Interinstitutional Agreement between the three institutions is also a valuable item and should help us to achieve joint planning security.
The main sources of this pressure are unemployment, the BSE crisis and the Balkan stability pact.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I am delighted to be with you here today to present an assessment of the French Presidency of the Union and also to consider the progress that has been made over the last few months.
As we promised, there are no leftovers from Nice.
This concerns the procedure for enhanced cooperation, which has, to a large extent, been made possible under the first and third pillars.
It is both a huge challenge and an historic milestone on the path towards the reunification of our continent.
As a result of this Charter, our Union will be stronger and have greater guarantees of the values of dignity, freedom and solidarity that are its cornerstones.
A few weeks ago, the chemicals tanker, the Ievolo Sun, sank just off the Channel Islands.
We set objectives for ourselves and they were achieved.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I think that today I can say that in the last six months, our Union has gained strength from the process of preparing to welcome new members, to reunite the family now that we are all assured of being able to work together, to gain a firmer place in the hearts of our citizens in the fields of values, growth and employment, of solidarity, security and the preservation of the European social model and finally, to grow stronger and gain support on the international stage.
(Applause)
This was inevitable given the approach taken, but the outcome was regrettable for two reasons: firstly because it made a qualified majority more difficult and a blocking minority accordingly easier, whereas logically, in an expanding Union, the exact opposite is required;
(Applause)
(Applause)
The ambition which was taken to Nice was the greatest European ambition for a summit meeting now for many years.
Madam President, Mr President of the Republic, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my group takes a very dim view of the Fifteen following the rather unappetising spectacle they put on for the European people, who were probably amazed to see on that occasion, and at first hand, the real common vision, sense of solidarity and mutual trust that exists between the major European leaders.
Any clear-thinking person can see that they herald the very serious consequences to which the project of a Federal Europe of 27 or 28 Member States is leading us.
Mr President, I also wish to emphasise that, after Nice, France appears once again to have been the clear loser.
Madam President, Mr President, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities regrets the fact that the Presidency has not followed up the message that was sent to it in July.
Many still have no sight of the port into which the European Union is supposed to sail one day.
There are, therefore, also constraints that must be appreciated.
I think they reflect the views not just of these three groups but of other groups which have refrained from putting their name to them for technical reasons.
Promoting the development of medicines in the Community is desirable because that makes it possible to give patients a better chance of benefiting from high-performance treatment.
I congratulate my colleague Mary Honeyball on her first report for the European Parliament.
Somewhat surprisingly, Mr Fatuzzo has the floor; I wonder which pensioner has said something to him this time.
The victim must be treated as a person in a particular situation of disorientation and distress - factors that are likely to be all the more acute if the crime happens to the victim in a Member State other than his/her own.
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on:
It was heartbreaking to see the debates concentrating on who would get one vote more or one vote less, and who would gain - Germany or France, the Netherlands or Belgium, Portugal or Spain.
So we welcome the prospect of a new method and we trust that, with the hope offered by the possibility of enhanced cooperation, Europe will continue to advance and will be capable of drafting a constitution for tomorrow which restores our fellow citizens' confidence in this tremendous project that is the European adventure.
The States preparing for accession will copy the example of our own Member States' egoism.
Some are happier than others about this, but the main message is clear: Europe can now be unified in an enlarged democratic EU which is also close to the people, thanks to the Treaty of Nice.
Individual interests have prevailed.
We managed to avoid an open crisis which would have threatened enlargement by coming to a last minute agreement on the Treaty, but we are left with a latent crisis which will have to be dealt with.
In my opinion, it is not more realistic to fight for one's own national prestige than to fight for the efficient functioning of the Union, and I would not say that huge numbers of European citizens came out to follow the naval battle fought by their leaders at Nice.
And what a fine project, eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall!
At that time, this applied to half of Europe; now we must develop it for all of Europe.
Thanks to Nice, the institutional barrier can no longer be invoked.
Firstly, institutional imbalance: a great deal for the Council and not much for the Commission and Parliament.
This method has had it.
The consequences of that for Europe would have been totally incalculable.
For example, in the early days of the European Union, as you know, two so-called 'big' countries could achieve a blocking minority, and today it takes three.
The milestones are in place, enlargement is possible, the European Parliament will have its place in the debate and in going deeper into the routes and ideas.
The European public interest, of which none of us is sole guardian - Mr Moscovici is right about that - cannot be based on the addition of national interests which are growing and becoming neutralised and in that regard Prime Minister Verhofstadt had a salutary message for us all.
We recommended that they be ratified.
I personally believe that the re-weighting of votes must take account of population, as is done in the European Parliament and should have been done in the Council also.
But Nice, Mr President, is not the end of the road, but the starting point for a new phase with many challenges.
I should therefore like to come back to something which has been touched on a few times today already.
In fact, while we seem to have succeeded in avoiding total paralysis of the future enlarged European Union, it has not been possible to convert the ambitions of the French Presidency into a new draft of the Treaty.
Mr President, as far as I am concerned, the Nice Summit simply failed to make the grade.
I do not know whether the Commission will reply at the end of this debate but I wonder, in the absence of the Council, whether the Commission is equally confident that by 2004 this European Parliament will contain Czech, Hungarian and Polish Members of the European Parliament and Members from the Baltic States.
We have made no bones about the need to continue with the same force and the same determination as before Nice, to achieve our objectives along the road to enlargement, which will be our greatest historical moment and which it is the responsibility of Parliament and the Commission to bring about in the coming years.
In addition, and above all, the problem of financing for the Balkans will still be there in its entirety for the years ahead.
I, in my turn, would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the Council and the Presidency on the work that has been accomplished, and the conclusion of this agreement which will allow us to vote for the budget for the year 2001.
It is also good that, as the main source of employment, small and medium-sized enterprises have been allocated additional funds.
In football terms it is like a l-1 draw.
Just because we have a budget and we have agreed a deal at conciliation, let us not imagine that all our problems have disappeared.
We do not gain this importance out of nowhere, but from the Treaties, although sometimes the Council finds it hard to admit it.
This should go hand in hand with a commitment from the College of Commissioners to a fair and efficient distribution of human and material resources for the management of the various policies, that is, they must remember the political priority of Parliament and the management priority of the Commission.
Which is why safeguarding and regenerating the environment is a job which has to be done at European Community level.
There is much talk of post-Nice.
You are, of course, quite right to keep reverting to this question.
Fear of military violence or of a dictatorship that might advance further, is a thing of the past.
If you take a close look, then roughly speaking, Russia is slightly ahead of Morocco in terms of budgetary importance, which cannot be right to my mind.
It would be a very dangerous situation if the Europeans were to become logistically reliant on Russia.
And programmes such as TACIS can only be of limited help here - more to the point, they barely scratch the surface.
The birth rate is dropping, the mortality rate is going up, and the net loss in Russia' s population amounts to a million a year.
Mr Putin himself - and we would not even be going as far as him - said that the issue of the future status of Chechnya is not the main issue.
It makes no odds to the west what is happening with Russia, its people and society.
Mr President, in recent years the European Union has finalised various documents relating to the Russian Federation which form a good basis for close relations with it.
And indeed, what does freedom mean for the Chechen people?
That will be the first step, after which attempts will be made to achieve respect for the law, which will be the second step, and then, economic development will bring more stability, all of which will bring about the features of civil society we expect.
But it is an excellent report which, like the common strategy itself, underlines the importance that we attach to the relationship - the strategic partnership - between the European Union and Russia.
This means concentrating our efforts on key areas like the environment - which has been referred to by a number of Members - and nuclear safety, on Kaliningrad itself and on improving coordination between different sources of funding.
We must avoid the mistake to which an honourable gentleman referred earlier, which was made at the start of the last century, when Russia was effectively excluded from European affairs after the Leninist revolution in 1917 with disastrous consequences.
As you know, the Council adopted a common position on the revision of Directive 90/220/EC.
I therefore believe that this is where you will find an answer to your questions.
I am therefore perfectly willing to propose that such a debate be held, on condition that the most appropriate forum is chosen.
I do not have information exact enough to enable me to answer your supplementary question.
How can he say he does not have any precise information?
The Council would remind the honourable Member of the conclusions adopted at the Council meeting of 19 May 1998 regarding fraud in the alcohol and tobacco industries.
All the Member States have confirmed their determination to intensify the fight against fraud both internally and in their relations with others.
The European Union has, on many occasions, stated its absolute respect for the right of asylum.
In this respect, the ACP-EC partnership agreement signed in Cotonou in June 2000 stipulates that the European Community shall by 2005, at the latest, allow duty free access for essentially all products from all LDCs.
The Presidency is not here to express the opinions of any given individual or any given government but rather to state what the position of the Council is at any moment 'x' or time 't' .
A purchase and destruction system is to be set up for such non-tested bovine animals, in order to compensate livestock farmers at the market price.
The French Presidency has, from the very outset, been concerned to bring about a European response to this crisis, which is a crisis in terms of foodstuffs, society and health.
Under the Barcelona process, Algeria endorsed a number of principles including respect for the rule of law.
. (FR) I have already had the opportunity, a few weeks ago, to express my comments to you on the preparations for the UN General Assembly Special Session devoted to reviewing the results of the World Summit for Children which is to take place in September 2001.
Subject: Turkey's obligations under EU-Turkey partnership arrangements In its proposal regarding partnership arrangements between the EU and Turkey, the Commission indicates that the European Council is to re-examine the situation regarding unresolved differences, particularly with regard to their impact on accession procedures, so as to help ensure that they can be resolved within the International Court of Justice before the end of 2004 at the latest.
Does the Council intend to discuss this issue with the Turkish Government within the context of this partnership which you have referred to?
Are the rights of defence being adequately honoured and will mutual recognition do anything to help?
It is, furthermore, up to each Member State to take a sovereign decision at national level whether or not to commit their national forces to the operation.
Subject: Bearing of taxes on the operation of the internal market In an article in the Financial Times in November this year, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, affirmed that he does not want to see tax harmonisation and common tax levels in the EU by stating that tax rates 'are in the hands of the national parliaments and must remain so'.
Question Nos 23 to 32 will be answered in writing.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia has come along at just the right time.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me congratulate Mr Baltas very warmly on his report, in particular for the fact that he drafted it so quickly, for it was both important and correct to react quickly to the changes in Croatia as Mr Stenzel said.
That means it really has made quite positive progress here.
In 1991/92 more than 250 000 Croats were expelled from Kraijina, from western and eastern Slavonia.
This has of course been a historic year for south-east Europe.
I do not think that is a bad record for a year.
This is an important point for us and we will, I hope, be able to count on Parliament's support when we come back to consult you formally once we have negotiated the agreement.
Here is a great deal of opposition to the Wahid government and the process appears to have come to a standstill.
There are still some Papuan leaders under lock and key too.
We also ask the European Commission to follow this policy line in our resolution.
Thus the terms of the Commission' s communication at the beginning of the year are justified, even if it is marked by a certain euphoria surely resulting from those changes.
The justice which is not being done and the refugee camps which are becoming permanent are areas for confrontation between the old and the new powers in Indonesia and reveal the fragility of the democratisation process.
What gives most cause for concern is the situation in the Moluccas, where Jihad fighters are left to their own devices in a manner which is insupportable.
Irian Jaya is also suffering the effects of migration policy.
To this end, we must learn to choose priorities: we cannot mix environmental issues, social policy issues or economic policy issues all at the same level as the key problem of respect for democracy and human rights, which clearly has to be a political priority in our relationship with Indonesia.
That resolution categorically affirms that Irian Jaya is part of Indonesia.
The situation has improved and we must encourage President Wahid, but there are still horrendous problems.
Clearly it is unacceptable that tens of thousands of East Timorese refugees are still held hostage at the mercy of armed bandits who, in the name of Indonesian patriotism, try to get away without punishment for their criminal past.
It matters because of its size - the world's fourth largest country in terms of population; it matters because of its economic scale; it matters because of its regional role; it matters because of its environmental impact.
That is why we must bring together police, administrative and criminal law resources and instruments, both between the Member States and with the EU.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mrs Schreyer, you have repeatedly emphasised to this House that as the Commissioner responsible for fighting fraud you see it as your special task to guarantee OLAF's independence.
It is the very establishment of a form of economic administration at EU level that creates the problems, because those models for redistributing EU taxpayers' money which have been established by the so-called 'Community' are poorly designed and in many cases quite unwished for.
I would very much like to congratulate the rapporteur - someone I like and admire as a person and politician - on this report, but unfortunately I cannot.
The report deals with the protection of the Community's financial interests and how we deal with that and these are the major questions.
Since time is short I will present the individual points briefly.
The debate is closed.
We have EU laws to protect business from such mismanagement and the Commission has now promised to introduce its own regulations to ensure prompt payments.
We have other mechanisms to highlight previously undetected instances of fraud.
Mrs Schreyer, you have just mentioned the Council, saying that there was a Member State that opposed the creation of a European Prosecutor.
I therefore feel that Parliament would be well-advised to let the Court of Auditors know exactly what it expects from these reports.
Neither the Commission nor the Member States will be able to absolve themselves of responsibility, certainly not by passing the buck from one to the other.
He said that quite honestly and regretted that it was so.
You took a very useful and I believe also a very self-assured step in involving the Commission as also the Court of Auditors in your deliberations before drafting the report.
You can see from what I said that I think it would be useful to discuss these proposals further in order to find out how to assign responsibilities more clearly here.
The first crucial weakness is the lack of harmonisation.
That is why I believe we must also improve Article 4.
Within the single market investors, be they private, corporate or pension funds, should be able to exercise the rights of ownership to the benefit of the companies in which they invest and for those investors in them.
We cannot close our eyes to reality: when there is a takeover there is staff restructuring, redundancies and so on, in short, measures which affect jobs.
But what are we in danger of doing as a Parliament, by virtue of the amendments tabled?
That is the principle on which perhaps we will divide tomorrow: what should be the over-riding concern of a law regulating takeovers.
It would, however, be easier to solve the problem of which supervisory authority is to have jurisdiction.
The rapporteur's amendments create confusion in the area of litigation and it would be wrong of us to vote for confusion in potential litigation cases.
A point I want to make with regard to this takeover directive is to bring the argument very firmly back to millions of electors in my country and millions of people who have pension plans and savings that are based upon investments in the stock market.
However, this procedure, which already exists in certain Member States, does not just affect the field of public takeover bids but extends much further and could, if necessary, be studied more closely as part of the general review of company law undertaken by the Commission.
On a final note, may I remind you that this is a framework directive, as requested by Parliament at an earlier stage.
Right of resale is the unassignable and inalienable right of creative artists to receive a share of the profits made from the selling on of their works.
On the one side, UK lobbyists fear job losses.
The agreement reached by the Council is no longer an accurate reflection of the Commission' s initial proposal, which was widely supported by Parliament at its first reading.
I also hope for the Commission's support, at least on one of the three major points of dispute.
It is also an issue about the vitality and competitiveness of the European art market.
In another case, the item would undoubtedly have been sold elsewhere, i.e. in America.
However, this amendment can be only partially approved.
Competition between postal services
That is what I propose, Mr Savary.
Firstly, we must ensure that postal services are provided at affordable prices; secondly, we must ensure that the services are of a high quality, and, thirdly, we must ensure that we are able to guarantee the availability of at least a minimum range of postal services in all parts of the European Union.
The Committee on Legal Affairs has been even more demanding as regards price limits on services reserved for the universal provider, but it proposes the same 150-gramme weight limit and jointly rejects the 50 grammes laid down in the draft directive.
Finally, a new date for liberalisation is unacceptable until a prior assessment has been made.
You know how difficult this issue is; it is laden with ideological overtones, sometimes from both sides.
Therefore, whilst that may be welcomed in certain parts of this House, it would have had a devastating effect on postal services throughout the European Union.
It will also lead to the closure of rural sub-post offices, because they rely on postal services for their very survival.
At this rate, we will need 100 years to bring about an open market for postal services in Europe.
Madam President, I should like to make three remarks.
We should be clear on one specific matter when we are discussing this new directive.
This is and must not become the case.
In a climate of honest competition, monopolists can show what they are made of.
But when grandma is happy because she has a friendly postman, which is also a factor in the quality of postal services, we should not begrudge her that pleasure but be happy with her.
Anyone who is so ill-prepared to enter into negotiations, anyone who fails to present the requested report on the impact of the 1997 Directive, anyone who argues from an ideological platform - "We shall achieve these very aims you have identified by liberalising, liberalising and liberalising again" - need hardly wonder when he falls flat on his face!
Mr Bolkestein, the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties.
In other words, it is like calculating the average income of the richest and the poorest person, which of course gives a perfectly satisfactory figure per se but can hardly be deemed to be socially acceptable to the poorest person.
These are new times, Mr Simpson.
The governments which brought this about were not Socialist, but Conservative or Liberal.
It was evident to me when the proposal first appeared that it would never be acceptable in the shape in which the Commission presented it.
We all agree on the need for this opening up and liberalisation, but the pace is important.
The effects of the first directive have not been made public, for the consequences are obvious: job losses and poorer working conditions, public services of varying quality throughout Europe, especially in rural areas and working class districts.
The Commission proposal provides for gradual further opening and will, in my opinion, surely lead to better services for the consumer at a more competitive price.
That is essential for the development of the direct marketing industry.
I appeal directly to the British Conservatives.
Let me say this to An Post: if this happens, you will have been given a valuable breathing space.
All we can now do is hope that, one day, we shall be able to move on from the present stasis and give real impetus to the European project by overcoming the various forms of self-aggrandising corporatism.
Only 3% of the letter market has been liberalised.
It will be overtaken by technology and ignored by consumers who do not get service for their money.
Only the introduction of real competition in a controlled and progressive way, according to a fixed timetable, will assist them to do this.
Regarding Amendments Nos 60 and 61, I can agree with the principle of completing the internal market at a future date to be determined within a reasonable time frame.
The Commission will put forward the same opinion and therefore the Council will act on the Commission's proposal as it sees fit.
Now, however, Parliament is to deliver its opinion.
My second report therefore looks very much like the first and again takes up the amendments voted on in Parliament.
Commissioner, it is true that we still have certain reservations and differences.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dary, who has given us such a full explanation of the reform, its history and development - which I am not going to repeat.
It is a form of production which takes place in a range of special Community regions, the outermost regions, which suffer a range of difficulties in competing in the markets and one of whose few products is precisely this one - the banana.
It is actually an inhibition on chaos because it tries to institute rules which we all abide by.
It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the issues to which all the institutions have paid the closest attention.
We should continue to have no problem about giving these producers the means to live by purchasing what they produce as a priority.
Mr President, the rapporteur deserves thanks and some sympathy for handling this difficult report.
I would also like to thank the chairmen of the political groups in this Parliament who have accepted the stubbornness and obstinacy of the Members from the outermost regions so that this proposal for reform of the banana sector may be debated today in this House, and the mandatory opinion may be issued and can thereby arrive in time for the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which will take place in the coming days and we can therefore enter 2001 with a new reform of the COM in bananas.
A lot has been made in this debate of the apparent unanimity of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in supporting Mr Dary's report.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour to inform you of the presence in the gallery of a delegation from the Korean Parliament.
This paved the way for a favourable decision on MEDIA by the Council.
Report (A5-0377/2000) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council extending certain programmes of Community action in the field of public health adopted by Decisions No 645/96/EC, No 646/96/EC, No 647/96/EC, No 102/97/EC, No 1400/97/EC and No 1296/1999/EC and amending those Decisions [COM(2000) 448 - C5-0400/2000 - 2000/0192(COD)]
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to refer to the remarks made by the Commissioner at 0.15 this morning and to point out that Amendment No 1 imposes an obligation of the Commission.
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
Amendment No 2:
Parliament needs to reinstate and re-table most of the amendments on the size of the warning, the list of ingredients and the protection of consumers, especially the young.
Might there be two categories of people as far as a number of MEPs are concerned: those that are to be protected and those that are to be endangered for economic reasons?
I wish particularly to explain why I voted against the ban on export of tobacco products above a certain tar/nicotine level from the EU and supported amendments that sought to lift that ban.
Madam President, I would welcome the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health, like they do in Canada.
I consider all this to be positive although I would prefer - and I say so now on this occasion - much more to be spent on the prevention of diseases.
I would have preferred this piece of legislation to have been introduced by means of a regulation, which is more appropriate for any activity relating to citizens throughout the European Union.
The amendments that Mr Zimmerling has tabled will deal a death blow to the vitality to the European art market, with loss of jobs and, I fear, very few living artists benefiting from this resale right.
. (NL) I would like to thank Mr Zimmerling for his work on this complicated dossier.
I therefore have no choice but to vote against this directive.
Moreover, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the CARDS programme and the European Investment Bank cannot constitute the main instruments for the European Union' s contribution to the economic and social development of Croatia.
The Indonesian government and the army have pledged to ensure the safety and to protect the lives of their citizens, irrespective of the religion they profess.
Consequently, we must establish the necessary instruments for more effective combating of fraud involving EU funds as soon as possible.
It would establish the EU as a single legal area for the purpose of investigation, prosecution, trial and execution of sentences concerning this type of offence.
We seem sometimes to have lost sight of this fact.
Amendments Nos 11 and 13 propose that the quota scheme should not be re-examined until ten years have passed and that there should be no commitment now to the tariff system proposed by the Commission and demanded by several of our trading partners.
As for the recital referring to the ACP preference, we agree with EUR 300 per tonne here too, but we consider the word 'maximum' to be unnecessary.
Besides, there is probably very little chance of our trading partners accepting such an extension.
The next item is the Commission statement on the EU/US summit.
This is, I acknowledge, easier said than done, but we should try to resist the temptation - and I know that Secretary of State Albright shares this view - for these summits to get excessively entangled in the nitty-gritty of our daily political and economic relationships.
One of the main lessons was that the Europeans needed to shoulder more of the burden in promoting European security.
I should be grateful if you would deal in detail with these agreements in the communication which is scheduled for the spring of next year and if, besides the analysis requested by the other side of the House, you would also make proposals as to how we can achieve new aims in future in all domains - in the various dialogues, in our cooperation in the fields of foreign policy and security policy and even in practical everyday areas such as the mutual-recognition agreements.
I also know and welcome the Everything but Arms Initiative and would urge the Commission to use the occasion of the summit to press the US again to join in with this initiative.
It is therefore necessary to take action to prevent the irreversible fate that awaits those women and men who, like Mumia Abu-Jamal or Leonard Pelletier, have sometimes been on death row for years.
That is a useful idea and we will certainly follow it up.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I fear that I am currently trapped in my group' s own crossfire.
Thirdly, we must turn to simple formulae for recovering taxes and, specifically, the reversal of the taxable person.
The first conclusion is that little can be done until the international framework is modified.
Mr President, the first point the committee would like to make is that current arrangements disadvantage EU providers of these services: software, data processing, and computer services, web hosting, web design and information.
I was always told that one of the first rules or principles of a legislator should be: do not make law you cannot enforce.
I am thrilled by the fact that, partly thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a number of important elements are once again brought to the fore in the report. Due to events occurring at the time, these elements met with less than adequate support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
At the same time, however, we must pursue the line of revising the Chicago Convention of 1944 so that we establish a different system in the international area.
By offering short-term location incentives, a government damages the economies of neighbouring Member States.
Mr President, Europe is to lead the world in the coming decade where use of the Internet is concerned.
Many are in fact asking themselves, Commissioner, why Europeans are always so quick to introduce taxes and new rules?
The Chicago Convention has become completely out-of-date on this point.
I do not see the introduction of a common system of VAT as a priority and I do not agree that the introduction of a common system is long overdue.
We must aim to streamline and simplify our tax systems and to reduce the rate of taxation, not increase it.
The preferable option by far is to zero rate European e-businesses to put them on the same playing-field as American and other businesses around the world.
Fiscal competition is in the interests of the people and of the economy.
Therefore, in order to ensure that operators from outside the Union are subject to the same tax obligations as domestic operators when providing services to consumers, they must be registered for VAT purposes in a Member State of their choice, with the VAT rate of the State they choose being the one that applies to their operations.
But the situation is not quite as straightforward as that.
The source where the tax should apply is a matter of concern, and the discussion around the number of countries which would qualify to have companies registered in them is something which I believe will be burdensome and of course provoke the USA to a complaint in the WTO.
It makes no sense at all that I can travel from London to Brussels return for just £89 by Virgin Airways, for example, yet when I use Eurostar, which produces far fewer greenhouse gases and is a much more pleasant way to travel, I have to pay the equivalent of around £250 for a similar journey.
Mr President, some old shibboleths have resurfaced in this debate.
Finally, the French Presidency' s proposals were discussed, according to which tax should be levied at the point of consumption, with a requirement for service providers to be registered in all the Member States.
European aircraft carriers would be disadvantaged compared to carriers from third countries and it would distort intra-EU as opposed to intercontinental fare structures.
It seems to me, however, that a solution which will avoid a flight of capital from Europe is only achievable within the OECD framework and not through a collection of individually negotiated bilateral arrangements.
I am aware that some Members have been swamped with opposing views.
This rules out the complexities which would emerge if macroeconomic or similar criteria were to be applied.
Allow me now to turn to the proposal on the minimum level of the normal rate.
Accordingly, no major groundwork has been done within the ICAO working parties and it is unlikely that the Chicago Convention will be re-negotiated at the forthcoming general meeting.
This feeling unfortunately still persists to this day in the mood of European public opinion.
And the final objective of this directive is to strengthen the management of emergency situations at sea, through the obligation to designate ports of refuge, the prohibition on taking to sea during high storms and greater powers of intervention at sea on the part of the coastal State in the event of a serious risk of pollution.
The oil companies tell us they have a voluntary fund.
I hope that after the impetus provided in Nice, the doubts and resistance of certain countries will have been reduced and that we achieve this.
We obviously have confidence in her ability to ensure maritime safety because she must know that not a week passes without our being asked what, as Members of the European Parliament, we are doing to ensure safety and to change the rules.
Mr President, the Commission is aware that one of the plans announced by the UK Government on 8 November 2000 was the introduction of some form of road-user charge such as a vignette payable by all road hauliers, British and non-British alike, for their use of the road network in the UK.
Secondly: If, as the minister originally intended, he proposes to put a tax on foreign lorries to subsidise hauliers of his own nationality, is that contrary to European law?
This imbalance of an economic nature between the charges and taxes imposed on hauliers in different Member States distorts the conditions under which hauliers of different nationalities compete in the UK.
On the question of the use of meat-and-bone meal: their export is covered in exactly the same way by the legislation that governs the production of meat-and-bone meal within the European Union, and also with the requirement for the removal, for instance, of specified risk material from meat-and-bone meal is covered in legislation and will be in operation from 1 March 2001.
The Jews are traitors and infidels.
I very much hope that in every country in the region we will find that educational services promote tolerance rather than intolerance.
That is not an unexpected answer from Mr Monti.
Question No 37 by (H-0900/00)
In addition, the Commission will, at the same time, propose a defensive temporary support mechanism, specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices for a period necessary for the conclusion of the WTO procedure.
This is a dramatic issue.
Coke-using industry employs a total of 70 000 people, but this product represents only a very marginal portion of its costs, in the region of 2%.
Question No 40 by (H-0889/00)
We forwarded our proposal to the ACP countries at practically the same time as to our Member States.
I should like, moreover, to reassure you that this initiative is not designed to solve that problem, given that the additional amounts which might be imported into the Community market are so small.
In view of their situation, these countries unfortunately have no capacity for autonomous negotiation, and it is therefore a gesture which we ought, in my opinion, to make unilaterally, without anything in return.
The Commission's procedure for granting the desired financial support will soon be complete, and this also includes the funds which ECPAT requires for 2001.
We have three types of activities in this area.
The issue of the geographical location of the new tribunal is not discussed in the Commission proposal.
I am not sure what the honourable Member means by the word 'proliferation' .
Mr Berenguer Fuster' s question relates to trade marks.
I take it as a stimulus to renew our action and to see to it that Spain does what it ought to do just as soon as possible.
You replied in answer to my previous question that Spain was to blame and that you would do what you had to do, but here it is you who are to blame.
It was a fine clarification of the reply I received earlier.
Directive 89/48/EEC pertains to higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration.
Subject: Transport links across the straits between Vaasa, Finland and Umeå, Sweden Shipping in the narrows of the Gulf of Bothnia is to be discontinued, since it is unprofitable now that shipping firms have no opportunities for tax-free sales.
For example, in Vaasa, the city I mentioned, 550 jobs have been lost in the last two years in the travel and tourism industry alone, which may have been the result of stopping duty-free sales.
This proposal reflects the goal of the Lisbon Summit by aiming to stimulate the development and the use of digital content.
Furthermore, I call on the Commission to conceive more efficient and faster implementation procedures in the field of calling in proposals.
If we include only content useful to businesses, particularly meteorological and geographical content (as is extremely desirable), it must not of course be forgotten that, where content intended for citizens is concerned, it is a much more complicated matter than of simply taking information useful to businesses.
Digital content, which is more quantity than quality, standardises and prunes cultural and social diversity.
The second point, which seems just as crucial to me, is that we must think about small and medium-sized enterprises, about business start-ups.
But if we make a virtue out of necessity and change the minuses into plus signs, if we consider our languages as bridges rather than obstacles, if we recognise and exploit the benefits they offer, they can form the foundations of a European market and lend us a certain independence.
I shall not go back and discuss all the objectives of this programme which consist in creating conditions favourable to the sale, distribution and use of digital content in such a way as to encourage economic activity, broaden the scope of employment and encourage exploitation of the potential of European digital content over and against that of digital content from the United States.
Thus having the right conditions in place for European multilingual digital content production is becoming increasingly important.
Some of them are indeed very valuable in themselves but are better placed in other instruments than in the present decision.
The different positions can be articulated, the vote has not been scheduled for this evening, and if the largest group in Parliament is of the opinion that the vote should not take place tomorrow, it seems more appropriate to me to submit such a proposal tomorrow when we have a full House rather than doing it this evening.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, noise is disturbing an increasing number of people in Europe.
It is left to the discretion of the Member States to determine when evening and the subsequent night fall.
I therefore welcome the Commission proposal, although I consider it to be an initial and - in my opinion - cautious step.
That is why the reduction and prevention of ambient noise will feature prominently in future European environment policies.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is happy to support him in this, although we would have preferred to take things one step further in our efforts to find appropriate solutions and tackle those making money on the back of pollution.
But allow me to say a few words on the bickering and the battle which has taken place recently behind the scenes, in and around, above and below, the committee, and which we witnessed in this Chamber a moment ago.
I will therefore not hide the fact that it will be very difficult for my country to accept the Commission' s proposal, unless it incorporates a sufficient mechanism for flexibility so that we can maintain the way of life that we inherited from our ancestors and, furthermore, which is so valued both by the Spanish themselves and by our foreign visitors.
I would nevertheless commend the report and of course the Commission's proposal to the House.
Secondly, we need daughter directives which establish quality standards.
I would fully support the need to harmonise noise indicators and assessment methods; the whole area of noise maps; the drawing up of action plans to reduce noise and protect quiet areas as appropriate and to broaden the whole scope for information to the public.
Secondly, this proposal uses a new approach to assess the overall noise situation in Europe in terms of numbers of people who are disturbed by noise.
The following amendments are acceptable in principle or in part: Amendments Nos 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 21, 22, 25, 28, 29, 32, 39, 42, 44 and 45.
Moreover, additives cannot, in general, be used, as in the present case, for unprocessed foodstuffs which have not undergone treatment involving a significant change to their original state.
Mr President, the PPE-DE Group voted in favour of the Lannoye report within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and it is, in fact, completely compatible with our wishes.
Nobody says that.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-372/2000) by Mr Staes, on behalf of the Delegation of the European Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition.
As a result, I received from the French Presidency a very clear signal, a very clear message indeed, which was 'no pasarán' (they will not get through).
Now, after lengthy negotiations in the Conciliation Committee, an acceptable compromise has been worked out, involving a guarantee that safeguard measures taken by the Commission will remain in force until they are replaced by another act and an obligation on the Member States to provide full assistance to the Commission officials carrying out on-the-spot inspections.
I welcome this legislation.
EU structural funds, mainly through the ESF, as well as national exchequer finances, must always be focused on developing disadvantaged and poorer areas in our society.
Europe' s cities and towns are important economic, political and socio-cultural centres.
Clear legislation and careful control of this are yet other tools.
The Commission is also grateful for the substantial support which the European Parliament has provided for this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been put forward.
Given the nature of the activity, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 10 and 23.
I say 'celebrated' because it is a very fashionable subject, and you will no doubt agree with me that not a day passes without the press, at the drop of a hat, running a headline on the precautionary principle, either advisedly or ill-advisedly, but misleadingly, more often than not.
The maximalists attempt to block innovation and progress, while the minimalists advise having recourse to the precautionary principle only in the case of significant environmental and health risks, that is to say above a certain threshold, although it is not really clear how to define this.
Clarifying who should do what is an essential prerequisite for restoring the necessary public confidence in both the scientific community and public decision-makers - us politicians.
In those situations, a safety margin is imposed as a precautionary measure.
We also called for measures in the World Trade Organisation, perhaps a regulation, which would ensure that it is possible, in the context of the WTO, to invoke other obligations, such as those we have under multilateral environmental agreements, to extend the scope of the precautionary principle.
It is of course also important to increase the legal weight with the aim of making the precautionary principle an international standard.
Life is about being able to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a sensible manner.
Sometimes it overuses it, cheapening it, and at other times it uses it too little and provokes our indignation.
We have the example of phthalates in children's toys and we also have this strange idea of putting toys inside sweets, ice cream and other edible products.
The same applies to the Commission' s requirement of a thorough risk analysis beforehand.
The resolution calls on the Commission to use the guidelines adopted and to incorporate the precautionary principle whenever necessary in drawing up its legislative proposals and in all its actions.
It is not possible to provide a general de minimis threshold.
In awarding the Sakharov prize for the first time to those who are actively defending human rights within the European Union, the European Parliament is stating formally that any violation of these rights must be fought uncompromisingly.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the 'Basta Ya' citizens' initiative wishes to express its gratitude to this Parliament for the honourable recognition it is receiving today.
We are not only talking about murders.
I therefore ask for your support and trust on this point.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Madam President, if the House permits, I should like to give an oral explanation of my Amendment No 51.
Report (A5-0334/2000) by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on the taxation of aircraft fuel (COM(2000) 110 - C5-0207/2000 - 2000/2114(COS))
This agreement is attractive to a number of companies but detrimental to the environment and democracy.
The most significant event to have occurred since our previous budgetary debates is, of course, the "mad cow" crisis.
This would clearly violate the letter and spirit of the aforementioned decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government regarding the seat of Parliament.
Parliament has succeeded in driving through a number of important prioritisations - including increased efforts in the struggle against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and equality issues, etc. We have voted against the right' s attacks on the LIFE programme and the European Women' s Lobby.
The size of the allocation that has been earmarked for Kosovo does not mean that there are not legitimate questions as to the real capacity of this region of Yugoslavia to absorb the EUR 350 million that were initially earmarked to be given to it in 2001.
There is no reason to give tax advantages to a particular form of distribution.
An end date would send a clear message to the players in the postal market and provide better opportunity for the national monopolies to prepare for deregulation.
Can we erase, with a simple decision, with a potentially small majority, the entire concept of the postal service, a concept whose roots and forms are bound up with the specific nature of each Member State?
The limits of 50 grams and two and a half times the public tariff are truly too drastic and would have had dire consequences for the providers of universal postal services.
Hence our unequivocal and steadfast opposition to the majority of its aims.
We do not consider that the postal service is an issue to be dealt with by the EU, even if the proposal following processing by the committee looks considerably better than the Commission' s original proposal.
Dary report (A5-0374/2000)
We nevertheless feel that the small producers who work their own plantations without exploiting anyone need to be protected from the consequences of this war, as do their incomes, whatever fluctuations may occur in the market.
Pursuant to Article 10, freedom of expression goes hand in hand with duties and responsibilities which can result in conditions, restrictions and sanctions.
We can only be delighted at such an initiative knowing as we do that the value of European digital content represents 5% of the European GDP and provides four million jobs.
In these circumstances, it is in large part the coherence and the unity of the United States that have guaranteed that country its pre-eminent position in this market of the future.
I also hope that the EU' s share of competences is reduced in 2004, applying the principle of subsidiarity so that the regions and autonomous communities may have adequate status within the Union.
We can only welcome such a move.
With regard to the trade negotiations mentioned earlier, for example, national parliaments will lose their last rights of ratification, and if a country is in a minority in the Council, it will no longer be able to say 'no' if negotiations threaten its interests.
We warned against this on repeated occasions and the events in Nice show with all the clarity one could ask for that a substantially broader agenda could have resulted in no result whatsoever being achieved this year, with catastrophic consequences for enlargement.
Given the fundamental importance of the decisions to be taken at the Nice Summit, credit must be given where credit is due.
In other words, what Parliament wants is control over taxation and social security issues.
These Council decisions, cobbled together in late-night sessions, do not constitute solid foundations; they are riddled with holes large enough for concepts such as transparency, the creation of a European identity, more democracy, popular participation and reformism to slip right through.
We must therefore see its conclusions as the result of a compromise in which nobody was entirely the winner or entirely the loser.
On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power.
You must therefore vote for this measure which further reduces taxation on aircraft, for this will bring the price of aeroplane tickets down and we will be able to travel much more frequently by plane.
'Don't walk near blocks of flats or something might fall on your head!'
The complexity and diversity of technological change and the structural adjustment processes demand the involvement of all relevant players at the local and regional levels in development partnerships, rooted in strategic policy blueprints that must be drawn up for the development of each region.
We must therefore strive to avoid anything which would stifle or detract from these important three prerequisites.
It could be said that innovation is within reach of all the operators involved in the production process.
The fact is that the technological gap between prosperous and backward regions is considerably greater than the difference between their respective Gross Domestic Products.
As we all know, any bureaucrat's basic argument is the risk of error.
I do not know whether it is a direct consequence of this Risi initiative that three ladies signed the European budget today, but I should be delighted if this Christmas present on which we are deciding today could also continue to benefit women in the future.
It is also a mistake to reduce the budget in a chapter such as this which was being dedicated to pilot experiments, to new ideas in the field of local and urban development - with some more than satisfactory results - which have formed the basis of Community programmes as cherished at local level as URBAN and INTERREG.
As Mr Rack quite rightly said, I have never construed this regional policy and this cohesion policy as some sort of alms to the poorest regions and I never shall.
That is why, when I am involved in negotiations - as I am currently with regard to SPDs - I take great care to check, over and above the innovative measures - and I refer here to the mainstream - that each programming document includes a regional information society access plan, and I check the quality, over and above the scope of the regional programme, especially as relates directly to SMEs, education institutes and even farm holdings.
Mrs Schroedter, Mr Izquierdo Collado and Mr Ortuondo Larrea quite rightly raised the issue of financial packages.
The prices of new ships have plummeted in recent years, reaching an all-time low in 1999 because of this policy that South Korea is pursuing.
The committee had to vote especially to ensure that this item was on the agenda for debate today.
This approach is also in line with the Treaty, although I do not have time to go into this in greater detail.
However, the Commission' s proposal, which includes aid for research and development, the condemnation of what is happening in Korea to the World Trade Organisation - since they are working with prices which are even below cost - and the possibility that there be transitional aid measures until the case is settled, seems to us to be perhaps a rather weak solution, but at least it is a solution.
At the same time, pressure on Korea must be stepped up, and we must involve the OECD if necessary, by taking anti-dumping measures.
That is, while we are enduring unemployment, the Koreans are doing good business in their shipyards.
I feel that he has produced an excellent X-ray of the shipbuilding industry in Europe, a true X-ray.
This process will not give quick results and if it goes to its ultimate conclusion, it will take up to two years.
The mechanisms would apply until the outcome of that WTO procedure is decided.
I am sure that we are all now united in our vigorous and forthright defence of freedom in Europe, but I wish to say that, more than the solidarity of the Members of the European Parliament, we in Spain need their commitment.
While sailing through Sicilian waters, back in the month of May, its nuclear heart showed worrying signs of deterioration.
It would be alarming if we failed to act immediately in this situation.
In both, we express the need for the two Member States involved, the United Kingdom and Spain, to work together closely to find a safer solution for the repair of the submarine, while keeping the public fully up-to-date, of course.
We have had statements from the responsible parties in the British army to the effect that the fault was not significant, and others saying the complete opposite, that it was serious and required long and difficult repairs.
I know the House recognises that she would have been here if possible and it falls to me to answer in her stead.
The Commission is analysing this plan.
It is already happening, so let us be realistic about what options face the UK and Gibraltar authorities in dealing with it.
Calm cooperation is the method which our Union uses.
The British Government is acting just as the Russian Government did recently when one of its submarines was damaged.
Mr President, I too would like to extend my deepest sympathy to our Spanish colleagues in the face of the latest terrorist murder by ETA.
The Commission, in its clear response two months ago and in its reply today, has been responsible enough to recognise this, although it has not been recognised in the Group of the European People' s Party' s motion for a resolution, a fact which, together with other trivialisations of the affair, has prevented us from supporting it.
Chief Minister Peter Caruana has wisely asked a panel of experts to report directly to him.
This has been and, in our view, remains, the most coherent position and the one which safeguards the interests and safety of all the parties involved.
B5-0908/2000 by Maij-Weggen and Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
In 1980, the UNHCR looked after five million refugees.
We are paying our respects today to the UNHCR and to all humanitarian workers.
Mr President, the Commission of course wants to associate itself with the support given by Parliament to the UNHCR for its 50th anniversary.
I want to refer to a broader issue that is very relevant to what the honourable Member said earlier.
B5-0909/2000 by Pack and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
And the last problem to which I wish to refer relates to the dreadful occurrences at the border between Serbia and Kosovo.
It is there that Milosevic belongs and not at party conferences in Belgrade.
We believe that within Kosovo too, the mentality of ethnic groups which are still fighting each other should make way for mutual respect.
Without blowing our own trumpet, we can also say that the European Union has responded very rapidly to the new situation.
B5-0915/2000 by Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0918/2000 by Napoletano and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;
The Chilean Government guaranteed that in Chile General Pinochet would have a fair trial and General Pinochet has indeed now lost his immunity and the Chilean judicial authorities are initiating proceedings against him.
And allow me to point out that it is important that we approve this joint resolution, now that Pinochet is in Chile, something that we were not able to do when Pinochet was in the United Kingdom.
I say that in the knowledge that these are foundational beliefs for the parties of the European Free Alliance and for the Greens in this House.
Mr President, before beginning my speech I would also like to join in condemning the attack that cost the life of someone elected by the people, and of an activist and councillor of the Partido Popular in Catalonia in Spain.
That is why I welcome the fact that my political group and, I think, the majority here in the House, will not be tempted to bang a drum in order to milk the current crisis for all it is worth.
Their very life is in danger.
The human rights league has been suspended, its premises placed under seal and its president, Moktar Trifi, has been summoned to appear in court, as you have just heard, on 25 December.
Human rights activists, trade union members, academics, journalists and students report constant harassment by the authorities.
His condition is very, very serious.
Daily harassment and beatings of democrats are a standard occurrence.
I hope that in this case the Chilean justice system will continue to demonstrate independence and effectiveness.
We understand that the European Union heads of mission have been following the political situation in the country closely.
Lastly, I would like to mention the crucial role played by Parliament, which has contributed to raising awareness and intensifying dialogue in these issues through parliamentary visits and through public debates like this one.
Laurent Gbagbo needs to introduce a real policy of national reconciliation by ending the discussion on Ivorian identity, revising the racist constitution and holding democratic elections open to all candidates; otherwise the risk of secession and civil war can only grow.
Mr President, for months the news from Côte d' Ivoire has been causing justified alarm within European public opinion and the corresponding concern in our Parliament.
The conditions for this are: that no one should feel excluded, that the Supreme Court established by the military powers should disappear, and that the Head of State should be unequivocally involved in the process of restoring democracy and that the opinions of the Committee for national reconciliation should be heard.
The concept of Ivorian nationality would appear to me to be perfectly well founded.
Some half-a-dozen copies are now available from the President.
Mr President, on behalf of the Greens, we also withdraw our motion for a resolution.
Mr President, I can confirm what Mr Posselt has just said.
(The Minutes were approved)
The Member States must implement different policies to support these people, tackling both the issue of the care necessary and the issue of the reimbursement of expenses, especially for those invalids whose families are, in effect, unable to bear the whole of such a burden in the long term.
Mr President, I am very pleased to speak on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report.
Nowadays, an increasing number of people live longer thanks to better health care, provision of information, care, housing and pension schemes.
It is mainly the Member States' governments at federal, provincial and local level which can put many of these recommendations to good use.
The basis for this outlook on life is the family, in which each human being grows up.
It is a common occurrence, in the latter years of life, for a worker to become very seriously ill, often a total invalid, needing assistance from everybody.
I should like to close with a word on medical care.
Then, people also said that women must not work so that the men could.
That may appear to be a handicap as far as many people are concerned, in the first analysis.
We really will have to find the ways and means to achieve this.
The countless active elderly people should motivate us all to fight for a society in which the phrase intergenerational solidarity is not just empty words!
These measures will have to be appropriate to the different specific circumstances of elderly people in terms of standards of living and financial self-sufficiency.
Only a sustained and joint effort can help us to meet them.
There must be discretionary powers for individual preferences and decisions.
If anyone finds any of these missing objects, would they please return them to Mr Fatuzzo, especially his glasses, because, Mr Fatuzzo, Mrs Flemming was sitting behind you.
Finally, a reference to the possibility of actions to promote products of the most remote regions and their logo should be explicitly reinserted into the text.
Another aspect to be highlighted is the animal-friendly and environmentally-friendly production methods used in Europe.
That is why I am also pleased that, this week in the European Parliament, we have set up a working group on biotechnology.
Of course, such institutional information campaigns must rather complement the advertising activities undertaken in particular by major distributors.
If Parliament's proposals to allow legumes and clover to be grown on set-aside land and be used for animal feed had been implemented - they have been passed by a majority three times here, but that shows yet again how powerless Parliament is - then we would have had more basic rations and more protein feed.
This is properly a matter for producers, retailers and trade associations, not the European Union.
We have to ask ourselves why we failed in the past to get industry in the European Union to take up the money that was available.
Of course, if we can produce and promote food that is better for the environment and takes animal welfare into consideration, and sell that on world markets, then we will be really fulfilling the vocation for which the common agricultural policy was intended.
All we can say to Amendments Nos 9 and 22, which call for a special management committee to be set up, and Amendments Nos 7, 19, 23 and 27, where further procedural changes are sought, is that the Commission has to be consistent with its procedural provisions.
All those who say that you can still tuck in in style in Europe are right.
Mr President, there is scientific proof that moderate consumption of wine is one of the best ways of preventing cancer, strokes, Alzheimer's disease and many other illnesses.
I would like to commend the rapporteur on his work.
