Hello sir. 
Hello sir.
What’s your name?
My name is <NAME> and I really don’t know what to get for my nephew’s birthday.
No sir, I’m your man.
What do you need?
I’m looking for a present for my sixteen year old nephew.
Ee- oh sir, tell me what you need.
Well, hard to say, cause my nephew is kind of difficult.
Oh, don’t worry, let me take the lead!
Tell me what to do to get the young one pleased. 
We sell cool boxes put together by our team!
Creative and original.
Isn’t that perfect for a teen?
We take some boxes and fill them up with dreams!
Okay okay, go on.
Let me introduce you to the hypebeast box.
Our team is aware of the latest trends 
That includes the clothes in magazines and tiktok.
Hmm, you have my interest now. 
Atchoo!
Oh sir, bless you.
We also have a covidbox with tissues, facemask, hand gel and everything that protects you.
Oh my god sir, thank you.
No problem, but now back to your nephews.
The Apple box, that’s what I recommend.
iPhones, iPads, all that kind of tech.
Good quality and good price.
Oh my god, I’m in love with it myself now.
I’ll take that one!
Okay sir.
Thanks for doing business with you.
KOL-ACTION!
