Hello, I am looking for some hotels and I noticed the logo on your mask.
Do you work here?
Hello.
Yes I work here.
It’s our hotel in a cave called Bat Bed.
I’ve heard about you.
Can you tell me something about your company?
We are in a town called Negril in eastern Jamaica, it’s a cave in a cliff right by the sea.
You’ll find here amazing rooms, delicious food, indoor and outdoor swimming pool and bars.
Wow, that’s sounds amazing!
How much does a place like this cost for the night?
For one person it costs 77 euros per night.
That’s a good price.
Are there any parties here?
Yes, they take place in the style of Jamaica and for quiet evenings we have a cinema.
Okay, thanks!
This is already my floor.
We’ll be happy if you visit us and do not regret it.
It was nice to meet you.
Bye.
Nice to meet you too.
Good bye.
