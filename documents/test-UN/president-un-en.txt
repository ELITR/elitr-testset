The Hague, Arusha, 10 December 2014
Address of Judge Theodor Meron
President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia
And
President of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal
Tribunals
to the United Nations Security Council
10 December 2014
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is an honour to once again appear before this Council in two capacities: as President of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and as President of the Mechanism for International Criminal
Tribunals. I hope that my remarks today will serve to elucidate certain key points set forth in the recent reports
submitted on behalf of these two institutions.
However, before I turn to these points, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Ambassador Zene of Chad on
his country’s assumption of the Presidency of the Security Council. I also wish to express again my appreciation
for the efforts of the Security Council’s informal working group on international tribunals, and, particularly,
Chile for its leadership of that group. And I continue to be extremely grateful for the extensive support that the
Office of Legal Affairs and the Legal Counsel provide to the ICTY and the Mechanism.

I will first turn to the ICTY. I am pleased to report that the Tribunal continues to make progress in completing
its last trials and appeals. Indeed, we have already delivered two appeal judgements in 2014, and expect to
deliver another one—in the large, multi-accused Popović case—by the end of January 2015. Accordingly, we
enter 2015 with only four trials and five appeal cases remaining. By the end of next year judgements in only
two cases—specifically, one trial and one appeal—should remain outstanding.
www.unmict.org
As our November report makes plain, and as Council members have been aware for several years, despite the
significant progress we have made in finishing cases, the Tribunal will not be able to complete all of its judicial
work by the end of this month. Numerous unforeseen and sometimes challenging circumstances, including the
late arrests of the last ICTY indictees, the disqualification of a Judge, the health conditions of a number of our
accused, and the size and complexity of certain multi-accused cases, have prevented us from meeting the
Security Council’s target date for completion of our judicial work by the end of 2014.
Although the majority of our remaining cases are progressing in line with previous forecasts, our November
report also explains that certain trial and appeal judgements will be later than forecast by the Tribunal in May.
The fact that such delays occur is disappointing to me and to my fellow Judges. Importantly, however, these
recent changes to our judgement schedule are not expected to impact the anticipated date of the Tribunal’s
closure, in 2017.
I would further note, as I have before, that the judicial process is inherently dynamic and mutable; it is a
process that takes place against a background of great legal and logistical complexity, and may be affected by
any matter of unforeseen developments, such as the discovery of mass graves with possible forensic
significance. In this context, forecasts for the completion of the Tribunal’s judicial work are inevitably subject to
revision. I can assure the Council that the Judges and staff of the Tribunal nevertheless remain focused on
doing all that they can to avoid or reduce delays. The Tribunal also remains fully committed to transparency:
when we know about changes to forecasts for a case schedule, we always communicate that information in our
reports.
There are two specific issues to which I wish to draw the attention of the Council.
The first involves the health condition of several of our detainees, which has impacted two of our trials and
which is a matter of great concern to the Tribunal and to me personally. As detailed in the November report,
the trial of Mr. Goran Hadžić has been temporarily adjourned since 20 October 2014 for reasons relating to
Mr. Hadžić’s health. In addition, the trial of Mr. Ratko Mladić has been reduced to four sitting-days per week,
following medical advice. At this time, the Hadžić Chamber does not believe the adjournment will impact on the
scheduled judgement delivery date. By contrast, the changes in the sitting schedule of the Mladić Chamber,
along with the recent decision to re-open the Prosecution case, mean that the judgement in that trial is delayed
until March 2017 or later. Finally, Mr. Vojislav Šešelj—whose trial was delayed by the disqualification of a Judge
in 2013—has been granted provisional release by the Trial Chamber considering his case, a course of action the
Chamber deemed appropriate in light of developments concerning Mr. Šešelj’s health.
www.unmict.org
Due to the age of our detainees, health-related issues are an unavoidable concern and raise humanitarian
questions. Although the Tribunal makes every effort to ensure appropriate medical care, developments related
to the health of detainees can sometimes fall outside our control and, as I am sure the Council understands,
can cause delays to the Tribunal’s work.
The second matter I would like to address is staff recruitment and retention. This issue, which is discussed in
my November report, also has the potential to adversely affect our judgement delivery schedule. As the
members of this Council are aware, the Tribunal is significantly reducing in size over this budget biennium and
by the end of next year is expected to have drastically cut its staffing levels. This downsizing is inevitable—but
also gives rise to challenges when it comes to maintaining appropriate staffing levels. Despite staff members’
dedication to their cases and duties, many of them are searching for other employment—and where offers
cannot be deferred, they are leaving the Tribunal, depriving us of valuable institutional and case-specific
knowledge.
Unable to deploy the most effective staff retention strategies, such as the incentive bonuses unfortunately
rejected by the General Assembly, the Tribunal is attempting to retain and, where necessary, replace staff
members in the most efficient manner possible. The three Principals of the Tribunal are most grateful to the
Office of Human Resources Management for measures taken to support the Tribunal in this respect.
By design, my reports to you on the Tribunal focus almost exclusively on procedural issues and requests for
assistance in completing our work. I very much hope, however, that the nature of these briefings will not lead
any of us to forget the bigger picture and the tremendously significant role that the ICTY has played, and
continues to play, both in setting global standards for international criminal law and justice and in helping to
strengthen the rule of law at the local level. Indeed, just last month I travelled for several days in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, meeting with representatives of diverse communities there and paying my respects at sites where
terrible crimes have been found to have taken place. Our discussions underscored that the ICTY has made, and
continues to make, an invaluable contribution to the restoration of the rule of law in the former Yugoslavia.
Given the importance of the Tribunal’s work, I would urge the Council to approve the full extensions of Judges’
terms requested in my letters of 1 October and 25 November. The precedents set by the Tribunal and by its
accounting for all of the 161 individuals it has indicted have been instrumental in inaugurating a new era of
accountability. It is essential that the international community continue to support us in this endeavour and one
of the best ways to do this is by granting the extensions needed to complete our few remaining cases.

www.unmict.org
I will now turn to the Mechanism. In creating the Mechanism, the Security Council not only tasked the new
institution with responsibility for certain essential functions of the ICTR and the ICTY. This Council also, in
essence, challenged the Mechanism to serve as an example of best practices and to learn from the experience
of other international tribunals in order to operate in the most lean and efficient manner possible, while
respecting relevant procedural safeguards. I am pleased to confirm that by almost any measure, the
Mechanism is meeting all of these important aims.
The Mechanism continues to make steady progress in carrying out its judicial work and later this month, in line
with previous forecasts, I will be travelling to Arusha to deliver the Mechanism’s very first appeal judgement.
Mechanism Judges in Arusha and The Hague have also been busy deciding a wide variety of motions, involving
issues such as variations to confidentiality protections and cooperation with national jurisdictions.
The Mechanism stands ready to adjudicate any appeals from the four trials ongoing at the ICTY. At the same
time, different sections of the Mechanism are preparing rosters to allow rapid staff recruitment and are
undertaking other measures to ensure readiness in case any of the three remaining ICTR fugitive indictees
whose cases have not been referred to Rwanda are arrested.
As set forth in my written report, responsibility for a wide variety of functions—including witness protection,
enforcement of sentences, monitoring of referred cases, and preservation of archives—has been transferred or
is being transferred to the Mechanism. Concurrently, the Mechanism is increasingly assuming direct
responsibility for administrative functions like Human Resources.
The Mechanism continues to engage with Rwanda and the States of the former Yugoslavia as well as with our
host states, Tanzania and The Netherlands. A host state agreement has already been signed with Tanzania,
while a text with The Netherlands has been initialled. In Arusha, we are moving towards commencing
construction of the new premises authorized by the General Assembly, and we are continuing discussions with
The Netherlands concerning the future facility of the Mechanism. Relying on outside funding, we are also
launching limited programs aimed at knowledge sharing with Tanzanian law schools and members of the
judiciary.
Two key challenges continue to face the Mechanism. The first is the outstanding arrest warrants for the
remaining ICTR indictees who have yet to be apprehended, including three who are expected to be tried by the
Mechanism. It is imperative that these fugitives be apprehended; just as the accounting for all ICTY indictees
struck an important blow against impunity, so too a full accounting of ICTR indictees will provide confirmation
www.unmict.org
of the international community’s commitment to justice and accountability. Accordingly, I urge this Council to
renew its call to all Member States to cooperate with efforts to arrest the remaining fugitives indicted by the
ICTR.
A second challenge facing the Mechanism is posed by the persons acquitted by the ICTR and the release of
individuals who have completed sentences imposed by the ICTR. The Mechanism will assume responsibility for
all such individuals released in Tanzania on 1 January 2015, having already assumed other relocation-related
functions. I consider the question of resettlement to be a crucial matter of humanitarian concern for the
international community. These individuals, having been exonerated or served the sentences imposed by the
ICTR, deserve the opportunity to be resettled and to rebuild their lives. The total number of these acquitted and
released individuals is very small and just a few States stepping forward to give them shelter could address the
problem.
These challenges to the Mechanism are real. They should not, however, obscure the real progress achieved in
launching both branches of the Mechanism and smoothly transitioning responsibilities according to the timelines
mandated by the Security Council. The Principals and staff of the Mechanism, and of the ICTR and the ICTY,
should be applauded for their efforts in making all of this possible.
Mr. President, Excellencies, despite the challenges that both the ICTY and the Mechanism face and that I have
highlighted in my briefing today, the world is unquestionably a better place because of them. This is not simply
because of their adjudication of specific cases but also because of the long shadow international courts cast,
promoting more lawful behaviour by States and individuals. With the support and encouragement of the
Member States of the United Nations, the ICTY, the Mechanism, and other international tribunals have served
and continue to serve as the concrete manifestation of a commitment to ending impunity and a testament to
the international community’s dedication to creating a world where the rule of law is supreme.
Thank you.

Address to the UN General Assembly
Judge Theodor Meron
President, Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals
9 November 2016
Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is my privilege to appear before the General Assembly once again in my capacity as President of the
Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals.
Before I turn to the substance of my remarks, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr.
President, on Fiji’s assumption of the General Assembly Presidency and to wish you every success
during your term. I also wish to acknowledge the steadfast support and assistance provided by the
Office of Legal Affairs and, in particular, by Mr. Miguel de Serpa Soares, the Under-Secretary-General
for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel, as well as by Mr. Stephen Mathias, the Assistant
Secretary-General for Legal Affairs.
Last, but certainly not least, I would like to acknowledge with pleasure my fellow Judge at both the
Mechanism and the ICTY, President Agius.

Mr. President, Excellencies, as many of you know, this year, 2016, marks the 400th anniversary of
William Shakespeare’s death.
His fellow poet and playwright, Ben Jonson, wisely and correctly anticipated in 1623 that Shakespeare
was “not of an age, but for all time”. Yet, it is to my deep dismay that Shakespeare’s depictions of
the ravages of war remain equally relevant today, some four hundred years after he wrote them. War,
in Shakespeare’s words, is the “son of hell” (2 Henry the Sixth); it is “fierce and bloody” (King John)
and “cruel” (Timon of Athens). Troilus and Cressida gives us a gruelling account of the senseless
slaughter of war, while Hamlet offers the most powerful statement of the futility of war in a speech
against sacrificing thousands of lives for trivial causes, for “a fantasy and trick of fame”.
While much has not changed when it comes to conflict and bloodshed in the course of four hundred
years, at least one important thing has. During the past quarter century, the international community
has come together as never before in an effort to end impunity for grave violations of international
law and to promote respect for the rule of law—or what Shakespeare refers to as “the majesty and
power of law and justice”, which the Chief Justice of England invokes in explaining to the new King
Henry V that even he had to submit to justice for infractions he had committed as Prince Hal (2 Henry
IV).
By establishing the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in the early 1990s, and the other international and hybrid criminal
courts that would follow thereafter, the international community has made manifest its commitment
to justice and to the principle of individual criminal responsibility. In doing so, the international
community has helped to bring about the dawn of what Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has described
as a new age of accountability.
The Mechanism is very much a part of this global effort to ensure accountability, for by establishing
the Mechanism, the UN Security Council was making certain that the closure of the ICTR and the ICTY
would not open the way for impunity to re-emerge and recognizing that justice and the rule of law
require a sustained commitment and support even after trials and appeals have concluded.
As detailed in the written report submitted on behalf of the Mechanism in August, much has transpired
in the year since I last appeared before this Assembly. On the judicial front, following the issuance of
ICTY judgements in December 2015 and March 2016, the Mechanism is seised of a retrial in the case of
Stanišić & Simatović and appeals in the cases of Radovan Karadžić and Vojislav Šešelj. A wide variety
of other requests and applications are regularly filed before the Mechanism and addressed by the
Mechanism’s Judges, the majority of whom are—consistent with the Security Council’s vision of the
Mechanism as a small and efficient institution—working remotely and part-time from their homes and
offices around the world, carrying out their functions for the Mechanism on top of their other
professional commitments. Since its establishment, the Mechanism has issued in excess of 800 judicial
orders and decisions.
With the closure of the ICTR in December 2015, the Mechanism has assumed responsibility for all
remaining functions of that Tribunal and preparations for the transfer of relevant remaining ICTY
functions continue, in anticipation of that Tribunal’s expected closure at the end of 2017.
Throughout the reporting period, essential ongoing functions—such as the protection of vulnerable
victims and witnesses, the provision of assistance to national jurisdictions seeking to ensure
accountability in local proceedings, and the supervision of the enforcement of sentences—have also
continued to be carried out with care and professionalism. Important steps have likewise been taken
with regard to the management and preservation of the vital archives of the ICTR and the ICTY
entrusted to the Mechanism.
It is thanks in great part to the sustained cooperation and generosity of the Government of the United
Republic of Tanzania that we will, in under three weeks from today, mark the opening of the
Mechanism’s new premises in Arusha. This construction project, which reflects a lean and minimalist
approach and incorporates best practices from other UN capital projects, has taken place under the
stewardship of this Assembly and remains—importantly—on budget. In the meantime, both Tanzania
and the Netherlands, as the Host States of our respective branches, continue to support the
Mechanism’s work on a near daily basis in countless but meaningful ways.
It is thanks to the support and assistance of Member States in Africa and Europe that we are able to
enforce sentences pronounced by the ICTR, the ICTY, and the Mechanism. The support and
cooperation of individual Member States is likewise essential in resolving the situation faced by the
Mechanism with regard to individuals indicted by the ICTR who were subsequently acquitted or
released in Tanzania. The appropriate relocation of these individuals, as I have stated before, is a
crucial challenge for international justice, and a humanitarian imperative.
And of course, the Mechanism will not have fulfilled its mandate unless and until all remaining
fugitives indicted by the ICTR have been called to account. Success on this front will depend in great
part upon the timely cooperation of individual Member States. I wish the greatest success to
Prosecutor Brammertz in his continuing efforts in this regard.
Indeed, as we move forward, seeking to fulfil all other aspects of our mandate in the best way
possible, the cooperation and support of the United Nations and its Members form the essential and
invaluable basis for all our efforts.
Mr. President, Excellencies, it is in this context that I find that I must advise the Assembly of a serious
matter impacting upon the effective discharge of the Mechanism’s mandate.
On 20 December 2011, following nomination by the Government of Turkey, this Assembly elected
Judge Aydin Sefa Akay, of Turkey, as a Judge of the Mechanism. This election followed Judge Akay’s
distinguished prior service as a Judge of the ICTR and, earlier, as an Ambassador of Turkey. After
consultation by the Secretary-General with the Presidents of this Assembly and of the Security
Council, Judge Akay was recently appointed for a new term as Judge of the Mechanism, commencing 1
July 2016.
On 25 July 2016, as President of the Mechanism, I appointed Judge Akay to a Bench of the Appeals
Chamber to address a motion for review of judgement and associated applications advanced by Mr.
Augustin Ngirabatware, who is currently detained following his conviction.
Without notification to the United Nations or the Mechanism, on or around 21 September 2016, Judge
Akay was detained in Turkey in relation to allegations connected to the events of July 2016 directed
against the constitutional order of Turkey, and has remained in detention since that time. As a result
of Judge Akay’s detention, the proceedings to which he has been assigned have necessarily come to a
standstill, with corresponding implications for the fundamental rights of the applicant to the
determination of his claims within a reasonable time.
Mr. President, Excellencies, judicial independence is a cornerstone of the rule of law, and it is a
longstanding and consistent practice to accord international Judges privileges and immunities in order
to protect the independent discharge of their judicial functions. The Security Council accorded the
Judges of both the ICTR and the ICTY diplomatic immunity to that end. The Statute of the Mechanism,
adopted by the Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, likewise accords the Judges of the
Mechanism diplomatic immunity for those periods of time in which they are engaged on the business
of the Mechanism. In according the Judges of the Mechanism such immunity, the Council necessarily
understood that, thanks to the Mechanism’s lean and efficient design and the statutory expectation
that Judges will work remotely as much as possible and away from the seats of the Mechanism, the
Judges would typically be carrying out their judicial work for the Mechanism in their State of
nationality.
As a result of this legal framework, Judge Akay enjoyed diplomatic immunity from the time of his
assignment to the Ngirabatware proceedings on 25 July, and continues to enjoy such immunity
through to the conclusion of those proceedings.
The UN Office of Legal Affairs, on behalf of the Secretary-General, has formally asserted this
protection to the Government of Turkey, and, as a consequence, requested Judge Akay’s immediate
release from detention and the cessation of all legal proceedings against him. In the meantime, on 17
October 2016, as President of the Mechanism, I formally requested permission of the Government to
visit Judge Akay to consult him confidentially and ascertain his conditions of detention.
Mr. President, Excellencies, I deeply regret that the Government of Turkey has thus far provided no
formal communication whatsoever on these matters to either the United Nations or the Mechanism,
and that the Government continues to maintain Judge Akay’s detention, in breach of the Statute of
the Mechanism and of Turkey’s obligation to cooperate with the Mechanism in accordance with
operative paragraph 9 of Security Council resolution 1966 (2010). I likewise regret that, as a result of
Judge Akay’s detention, the will of this Assembly that he discharge judicial functions for the
Mechanism, consistent with the provisions of the Statute pursuant to which he was elected and then
appointed to a new term, is concurrently being frustrated.
As Judge Akay’s detention becomes increasingly prolonged, its effects on the Mechanism’s ability to
perform its core mandate become ever more pronounced, as this detention has materially impeded
the Mechanism’s ability to perform one of its most fundamental functions: to judicially determine, in
accordance with the law, matters going to an individual’s responsibility for the most serious
international crimes. Absent clear understanding of his conditions of detention, and a response to my
request for authorization to visit Judge Akay, my concern for my judicial colleague’s welfare from a
humanitarian standpoint likewise becomes all the stronger.
I therefore call upon the Government of Turkey, consistent with its binding international obligations
under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, to immediately release Judge Akay from detention and enable
him to resume his lawfully-assigned judicial functions.
Mr. President, Excellencies, in discharging our mandates to pursue justice and accountability for the
most serious crimes known to humanity, international criminal tribunals such as the Mechanism serve
the interests of all States and their peoples. At the same time, however—and as the past twenty-five
years have demonstrated—international criminal tribunals are fully dependent both on the cooperation
of States and on States’ respect for the international legal framework applicable to each institution.
Without such cooperation and respect, international courts cannot ensure their independent
operation, wherever around the world court functions may be exercised, and they therefore cannot
carry out the vital mandates entrusted to them.
I have every confidence that the Government of Turkey shares this common interest in enabling the
Mechanism to function efficiently and effectively, in accordance with its mandate and with applicable
law, and that the Government will, without further delay, take the necessary steps with respect to
the situation I have described towards that end.
The resolution of this matter is critically important not simply for the Mechanism. It is essential for all
of us if we are to ensure that UN institutions are able to carry out their mandates in accordance with
the law and in the absence of interference. It is essential for all of us if we are, working together, to
bring about an era of accountability based upon and enshrining respect for the rule of law, for which
judicial independence is fundamental. It is essential for all of us who wish to be able to say that we
have done all that we can to end impunity for horrific crimes in violation of international law and to
seek to bring about a world in which the highest humanitarian principles are upheld. But to
accomplish all of this, it is essential that all Members of the United Nations, in addressing vital
requests from Chapter VII tribunals, act in accordance with good faith, the duty to cooperate, and
unimpeachable due process.
Thank you.

Address to the UN Security Council
Judge Carmel Agius
President, International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals
17 July 2019
Mr President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I feel deeply honoured to have once again the privilege of addressing the Security Council; this time as the new
President of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (Mechanism). I am fortunate to have
assumed the leadership of the Mechanism when the institution is strong and well-established, thanks to the
unstinting and outstanding work of my predecessor, Judge Theodor Meron, together with that of my esteemed
Colleagues, the Mechanism’s remarkable Judges, and of course its wonderful staff.
This is not to say that my first months have been easy. The role of Mechanism President is a demanding one:
running an institution spread across two continents, with Judges and staff coming from numerous legal systems
and diverse backgrounds, working in different time zones; with our focus split between the residual judicial
matters arising out of two very distinct conflicts and resulting from the closure of the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). I already
knew of these unique circumstances before assuming the Presidency, of course, because I have been a Judge of
the Mechanism since it came into operation in 2012, and was a Judge of the ICTY for many years before that.
Nevertheless, I have been surprised and enthralled by the extent to which the Mechanism differs from its
predecessor institutions.
Despite our unique mandate and the many challenges that no doubt lie ahead, I remain fully committed: first and
foremost, to the efficient and timely conclusion of the judicial proceedings at both the Arusha and The Hague
branches of the Mechanism, bearing in mind due process and fundamental fair trial rights; second, to enhancing
inter-branch coordination and harmonisation of practices and procedures; and third, to doing my utmost to foster
a working environment that encourages high staff morale and performance. This is in line with the priorities I
announced at the start of my Presidency, which are elaborated in document S/2019/417, being the Mechanism’s
progress report for the period 16 November 2018 to 15 May 2019. I must add that this report partly reflects the
work of the Mechanism under President Meron’s guidance until 19 January of this year, when I took over the
leadership of this fine institution from him.

STATEMENT
PRESIDENT
Mr President,
As set out in the report before you, the Mechanism continues to work vigorously towards concluding its residual
judicial workload. Notably, most of this work has been performed by Judges working remotely with the assistance
of Chambers staff at both branches, in accordance with the imperative to operate in a cost-efficient manner. In
the Mechanism’s seven years of existence, its Judges have had only two opportunities to come together for the
purpose of in-person Plenary sessions. The second in-person Plenary of Judges, and the first to be held at the
Mechanism’s Arusha branch, took place earlier this year in March, offering my Colleagues and me a tremendous
opportunity to discuss practical and substantial matters, familiarise ourselves with the new courtroom, and get to
know our dedicated staff in Tanzania. This was a most valuable meeting, which I hope will be repeated
periodically.
Turning to our workload, I am pleased to note that the Appeal Judgement in the Karadžid case was delivered on
20 March 2019, representing a milestone for the Mechanism in the conclusion of one of its most significant cases.
Remarkably, the timely adjudication of the case was achieved despite changes in the Bench at a very late stage. I
wish to particularly commend Judge Vagn Joensen, who took over as the Presiding Judge, and Judge Ivo Nelson de
Caires Batista Rosa, who upon being newly assigned to the case was able to quickly take up the complex and large
responsibilities entrusted to him.
In relation to the other ongoing cases in The Hague, I am likewise pleased to report that changes in late 2018 to
the Bench assigned to the Mladid case have also not resulted in any delays to the appeal proceedings, which are
progressing smoothly. I am grateful to the Presiding Judge, Judge Prisca Matimba Nyambe and the other Judges
on the Bench, whose diligence together with that of the Chambers team has allowed the case to remain on track
for conclusion by the end of 2020. Solid progress is also being made in the Stanišid & Simatovid re-trial, with the
Defence case underway as of 18 June 2019. Thanks to the dedication of the Presiding Judge, Judge Burton Hall
and the rest of the Bench and assigned staff, the Trial Judgement in this case also remains on schedule for
delivery by the end of 2020.
In Arusha, the Ngirabatware review proceedings are currently expected to be heard in September of this year. As
you may be aware, the replacement of Mr. Ngirabatware’s counsel and the disclosure of voluminous material
from a related contempt case resulted in the postponement of the review hearing, which had previously been
scheduled for September 2018.
In addition to these proceedings, which relate to core crimes within the jurisdiction of the Mechanism, the
Mechanism is seised of a number of cases pertaining to allegations of contempt of court. I refer in particular to
the multi-accused Turinabo et al. case, in which a Single Judge continues to conduct pre-trial proceedings and to
deal with numerous motions filed by the five accused. It is anticipated that the trial will start in October 2019 and
conclude in the first semester of 2020. Here I would like to add that the Appeals Chamber, myself presiding, is
also seised of several appeals of pre-trial decisions of the Single Judge, and is exerting its best efforts to ensure
that these are adjudicated as expeditiously as possible, in order to allow the trial to start on time.
Another contempt case, the case of Petar Jojid & Vjerica Radeta, is presently back before the Mechanism. This
case was in 2018 referred to the authorities of Serbia for trial but was subsequently remanded back to a Single
Judge following an appeal by the amicus curiae prosecutor. In May of this year, the Single Judge revoked the
previous referral order and requested Serbia to transfer the accused to the Mechanism without delay. While the
two accused have not filed an appeal against this decision, Serbia has, and the matter is currently pending before
the Appeals Chamber.

STATEMENT
PRESIDENT
Mr President,
What you have just heard relates to the most visible aspect of the Mechanism’s mandate, namely its residual
judicial workload. It is clear that our trials and appeals, and especially our decisions, orders and judgements, are
followed closely not only by the countries most affected by our work, namely Rwanda and those in the region of
the former Yugoslavia, but other United Nations Member States and numerous stakeholders around the world.
Less attention, however, is paid to the Mechanism’s additional statutory functions, which include protecting
victims and witnesses, monitoring cases referred to national jurisdictions, preserving the archives of the ICTR, the
ICTY and the Mechanism itself, addressing requests for assistance from national jurisdictions, and supervising the
enforcement of sentences.
I would therefore like to share some of my reflections since assuming the Presidency on what it means to manage
some of these residual matters, and will focus my remarks here on enforcement issues.
My first observation may be an obvious one, namely that justice does not end with the delivery of a judgement. I
am referring here to post-conviction matters, which are a little-understood but crucial part of the Mechanism’s
work. The legal framework of the Mechanism grants me as President broad powers to supervise the enforcement
of sentences, and I do not take these responsibilities lightly. Determinations as to where a convicted person will
serve his or her sentence, whether he or she should be transferred to continue a sentence elsewhere, or whether
a person may be eligible to be considered for early release, pardon or commutation of sentence, are extremely
important. They are also very sensitive, relating inter alia to the rights of detainees and concerning sentences
imposed as a result of painstaking, often lengthy trial and appeal proceedings concerning the gravest violations of
international criminal law. My duty is and remains to apply the law, and I will continue to do so responsibly,
thoroughly, and with as much transparency as possible. I would recall that, pursuant to the Mechanism’s legal
framework, such decisions involve the exercise of discretionary functions by the President, and require a careful
case-by-case assessment and balancing of factors.
Second, as a judicial institution the Mechanism is bound to strictly observe its duty to safeguard the rights of all
its detainees, whether subject to pending or ongoing proceedings or awaiting transfer to an Enforcement State.
As of 5 December 2018, the Mechanism is now implementing a new regulatory framework on detention matters
that I believe can serve as a model to other institutions. In this regard, the Mechanism has been guided by the
need to harmonise practices between the Arusha and The Hague detention facilities, and by standards enunciated
by the General Assembly through its adoption of the Nelson Mandela Rules (A/RES/70/175). Moreover, it has
sought to build upon those standards through detailed procedures governing visits, communications, complaints,
and disciplinary matters in a detention setting. The Mechanism will continue to focus on ensuring that its
implementation of this framework is also reflective of best practices in detention management.
Third, in undertaking its enforcement functions, the Mechanism will continue to rely on the support of Member
States and other key stakeholders. It is evident that in order to have an enduring impact on international peace
and justice, we must all remain committed not only to having trials and appeals and active judicial processes, but
also to what comes afterwards. In my six months as President, I have come to appreciate even more how complex
the enforcement of sentences can be, and how precious such commitment is. In this regard, I would like to praise
the critical role performed by Enforcement States that voluntarily assume additional responsibilities to further the
cause of international justice. In particular, I wish to thank Austria, Benin, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Mali, Norway, Poland, Senegal, Sweden and the United Kingdom for their generosity and ongoing
support with regard to the Mechanism’s enforcement functions.
This exemplary cooperation is not only vital to the Mechanism’s ability to fulfil its broader mandate, it is also a
sign of the trust and credibility that our institution enjoys in the eyes of the international community. For that

STATEMENT
PRESIDENT
reason, I am compelled to raise a challenging and most unfortunate situation under the Mechanism’s purview. I
am referring to the fate of the nine acquitted and released persons that remain in Arusha, one since 2004, in an
unacceptable legal limbo. These persons should be free to start a new life, having served their sentences or never
been convicted in the first place, and yet they cannot. While the Mechanism is doing all it can to find a long-term
solution, the fate of these nine individuals is a responsibility it shares with the Member States of the United
Nations, as was noted in Resolution 2422 (2018). More can, and must, be done to resolve this situation.
Mr President,
It is of course a double pleasure for me to appear before the Security Council on the Day of International Criminal
Justice - a day celebrating the achievements of international criminal courts and tribunals in delivering justice and
holding to account those responsible for violations of international law. Today we pay tribute to the vision and
commitment of all of the individuals, organisations and stakeholders who have advocated, and continue to
advocate, for justice to be more than an abstract ideal. The underlying reason for this important day, namely the
adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, would not have been possible without the ICTY
and the ICTR having paved the way for such a remarkable endeavour. The establishment of the Mechanism, as
the successor institution to the two ad hoc Tribunals, further demonstrates the Council’s commitment to
principled accountability and your resolve to ensure that the closure of the Tribunals will not open the way for
impunity to reign once more.
On this day we are also called upon to remember that international criminal justice is not the responsibility of
courts alone. All those who are committed to the rule of law have a vital part to play in the fight against impunity
- and particularly now, when there is a resurgence in genocide denial and revisionism in both the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda. This includes by defending judicial processes and pronouncements, and speaking out
against those who try to distort the truth as established by international and domestic courts. Consequently,
those who deny the legitimacy of the findings of the ICTY, the ICTR and the Mechanism must be reminded that
you, the Security Council, mandated these institutions – and no-one else – to investigate, prosecute, adjudicate
and punish the crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Likewise, they must be reminded that
the domestic courts are entrusted with continuing to carry out these functions, and not politicians or individuals. I
therefore call upon you all to defend and protect our judicial legacy, which established time and time again,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that what the world witnessed both in 1994 and in 1995 was genocide, together with
the gravest and most brutal of other international crimes.
International criminal justice concerns us all, because justice is in the service of peace, and peace must be
maintained on a daily basis, as this distinguished Council knows all too well. The extent of the world’s yearning for
justice was made clear to me this April when I attended the Twenty-fifth Commemoration of the Genocide
against the Tutsi, in Kigali, and again last week in Potočari where I attended the Twenty-fourth Commemoration
of the Srebrenica Genocide. These occasions reinforced in me the firm belief that, while international justice takes
time and costs money, for the victims and affected communities it is worth it, offering not only some form of
closure but also a powerful way forward. However, we must be mindful that justice has enemies as well,
constantly seeking to make sure that countless atrocities throughout the globe remain unanswered.
Mr President,
I am determined to do my utmost to maximise the Mechanism’s ability to deliver meaningful justice and to fulfil
all aspects of its mandate in an effective and efficient manner. My Colleagues the other Judges and the

STATEMENT
PRESIDENT
Mechanism’s Principals, together with our exceptional staff, are equally committed to this task. However, we
cannot do it alone. The success of international justice depends on sustained support and cooperation, today and
every day. I hope, and trust, that the Mechanism will continue to find such help in the esteemed Member States
of this Council. For your support thus far, I am extremely thankful.
Before concluding, please allow me, Mr President, to commend you on your Presidency for the month of July and
to thank you in particular for your personal commitment and outstanding leadership as Chair of the Council’s
Informal Working Group on International Tribunals. My recognition also goes to the Office of Legal Affairs and its
dedicated team for their invaluable support.
And last but not least, I wish to express my sincere gratitude for the continuing and excellent support provided by
the two Host Countries of the Mechanism, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Republic of Tanzania.
Thank you for your attention.
