Chapter I
Introduction
As I submit my tenth and final annual report to the Member States on the work of the Organization, I recall the opening lines of my very first annual report, in which I observed that Member States and the peoples of the world were asking the United Nations to do more — in more spheres of activity, in more locations, in more challenging circumstances — than at any point in the Organization’s history. This trend has been the defining feature of my 10 years at the helm of the United Nations Secretariat. As I prepare to leave office, the United Nations has more political missions and peacekeepers deployed in more — and more dangerous — locations than ever before. It has its largest-ever humanitarian caseload, including more people displaced from their homes than at any time since the founding of the United Nations. As a result of the adoption of bold new agreements on sustainable development and climate change, it has a more ambitious sustainable development agenda than ever. Notwithstanding other periods of multiple demands on the Organization, the present scale and complexity of its global operations and programmes are unprecedented, even as it grapples with limited resources. By adapting to evolving needs and opportunities, the Organization has become more effective and efficient in how it delivers on its mandates. But increased demand ultimately requires increased investment and trust from Member States so that the United Nations can continue to deliver.
This rising level of demand upon the United Nations is in keeping with the dramatically changing global landscape and the growing number of challenges that no country can confront alone. It reminds us anew of the enduring value of the United Nations as a forum for problem-solving and a tool for burden-sharing. This was a decade of tectonic turbulence and exponential change. Globalization ushered in many opportunities for prosperity and for a sense of shared global community and humanity. But with greater opportunity emerged greater risk and unforeseen challenges. Just as goods and people moved seamlessly across borders, so too did diseases, weapons and extremist propaganda. Events in one part of the world reverberated all over the globe. The decade was marked by a series of crises with global repercussions, from the financial, food and fuel crises to the wave of unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. These setbacks diverted resources away from development towards crisis response and magnified fear and anxiety in many quarters. Throughout my tenure, leaders and global institutions struggled to keep pace with change and to sustain popular faith in their ability to manage its consequences. This was the first decade of the social media age, in which the voice of “we the peoples” was increasingly, resoundingly heard in global affairs. People rightly demanded more of their leaders and more of the United Nations. I trust that they will look back on this decade as a time when the Organization delivered for them, while also adapting to a profoundly changing world so that it could continue to deliver long into the future.
I took office determined to adapt the United Nations — and to support Member States in adapting — to deepening interdependence in a fast-changing world. To that end, I undertook a series of structural reforms and other steps to improve the Organization’s functioning and effectiveness, while also advocating vigorously for Member States to keep their commitments across all three pillars of the work of the Organization — peace and security, development and human rights. Many of my efforts have borne fruit within this most recent reporting period.
In the area of development, throughout my tenure I advocated for keeping the promise of the Millennium Development Goals and accelerating their implementation. We met the first Millennium Development Goal, cutting global poverty by half. We put more girls in school and saved more mothers from death in childbirth. These were no small feats but they were not enough to deliver a life of dignity for all. People around the globe continued to struggle to put food in their children’s mouths, to earn a living wage and to live a life of dignity and peace. As the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals neared, we recognized that their successors would need to more fully integrate economic growth, social justice and environmental stewardship. An impressive global coalition came together to craft a set of sustainable development goals that were adopted by Member States as part of Agenda 2030 in September 2015. These goals are designed to be universal, broader, and more inclusive than their precursors, including by encompassing such key aims as peace, justice and strong institutions.
Recognizing that we were the first generation to truly feel the effects of climate change and the last generation that could take meaningful steps to avert its worst impact, I decided early in my tenure to take a leadership role on this existential threat. When I took office, international climate negotiations were making slow progress and it was not universally accepted that the United Nations Secretary-General had a personal role to play. However, I could not stand by in the face of a faltering global response to the defining challenge of our time, which was already having an effect on all areas of work of the United Nations. I engaged directly with world leaders, paying visits to some of the worst affected parts of the world, and undertaking a wide variety of other initiatives to keep the issue — including that of climate finance — on top of the global agenda. Combined with global action at many levels by world leaders, civil society, the private sector and many other concerned actors, those efforts contributed to the Paris Agreement of 2015. The agreement was a triumph for people, planet and multilateralism itself. On Earth Day 2016, 175 countries signed the agreement, breaking a global record. Much of the hard work lies ahead but I will leave office encouraged that the issue got the attention it deserved in time to make a difference.
Women hold the key to driving progress across the international agenda. With that in mind, I made the empowerment of women a cardinal mission throughout my time in office. I ushered UN-Women into existence and undertook special initiatives on issues such as maternal and child health, sexual violence and economic empowerment of women. I tried to set an example through improving the gender balance in senior appointments at the United Nations itself. We did not reach parity but we broke many glass ceilings during my tenure. When I took office, there were no women heading peace operations in the field. Now, nearly a quarter of United Nations missions are headed by women. I also appointed the first woman Legal Counsel, the first woman Police Adviser, the first woman Force Commander and more than 100 women at Assistant or Under-Secretary-General level.
With the world supporting its largest-ever generation of young people, I also sought to harness the energy of youth. We saw time and again their energy, passion, and keen desire for a voice in their own affairs. I responded by appointing an Envoy on Youth — himself only 28 years old — and making every effort to ensure that the voice of those “succeeding generations” was heard in our decision-making at the United Nations. I made a point of meeting with young people whenever possible, to hear their concerns and to encourage them as the leaders of tomorrow.
In the area of peace and security, I made conflict prevention a priority throughout my time in office, beginning with strengthening United Nations capacity in mediation and preventive diplomacy. The proof of these reforms has been in the heightened demand throughout the decade and across the globe from Member States and regional partners for preventive diplomacy, mediation and mediation support from the United Nations. In 2016 alone, my envoys continue the painstaking work of diplomacy on the Syrian Arab Republic, Yemen, Libya and elsewhere, while United Nations personnel in peace operations and country teams work discreetly around the world to avert violent conflict and promote dialogue. I am pleased that Member States have responded to the recent series of independent reviews of our action on peace operations, peacebuilding and women and peace and security by pointing to the imperative of conflict prevention. We have much work to do to consistently translate this rhetoric into reality. In that connection, I launched the Rights Up Front initiative to better link the three pillars — peace and security, development and human rights — and to use prevention of violations as a principle for internal decision-making by the United Nations.
During my tenure, the United Nations became the second largest deployer of troops in the world. Peacekeeping deployments hit an all-time high. Deployments were not only bigger, they were far more complex and sometimes more remote. Operating environments became more and more dangerous as the security situation deteriorated in many regions. This required us to innovate continuously so as to make peace operations more responsive, effective and accountable. Accordingly, there were important reforms to the architecture of the United Nations in the peace and security realm throughout my tenure. As I took office, the new peacebuilding architecture was getting off the ground and, over the course of my time in office, it made a mark on our work to more successfully build and sustain peace in countries that had suffered the scourge of war. Member States have just adopted ground-breaking resolutions on sustaining peace that enshrine many of the lessons we have learned along the way.
I also book-ended my tenure with reforms to our systems for deploying and managing peace operations. This began with the establishment of the Department of Field Support and ended with proposals from the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, which made important recommendations on how we can better manage peace operations and deepen the global partnerships underpinning them. Some of the Panel’s ideas will necessarily fall to my successor and many of the most important are in the hands of Member States but the bulk of those that fall under my authority are expected to be well implemented by the time my term concludes.
Institutional reforms alone will not be sufficient to the future effectiveness of our operations, however, if they are not undertaken with a renewal of the requisite political will and trust. The compact among Member States that contribute in different ways to peace operations, and between Member States and the Secretariat, has been frayed by some of the challenges of recent years and badly needs to be restored, especially in cases where host government consent comes into question. I was especially disappointed by the muted response from the Security Council to the expulsion of United Nations civilian personnel from Western Sahara. I was also disappointed at the limited support for new proposals to strengthen our capacity for conflict prevention, in view of the clear consensus that we urgently need to do better at preventing violent conflicts before they start.
The deteriorating security environment required us to innovate in other ways too. The reporting period began with the winding down of the first-ever United Nations emergency health mission. The United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response was an important and successful example of the flexible and creative use of the United Nations political, logistical and other capacities to respond to the kinds of unanticipated crises that our interconnected world experiences with ever more frequency. Emerging threats such as organized crime and violent extremism also required new approaches and a principled collective response. One major output of this effort was my Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. I was pleased that Member States supported the call in my plan for a comprehensive approach encompassing not only security-based counter-terrorism measures but also systematic preventive steps to address the underlying conditions that radicalize individuals and drive them to join violent extremist groups. I look forward to continuing engagement on this and related issues in follow-up to the General Assembly review of its counter-terrorism strategy.
Another innovation was the response to the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, where the joint investigative mechanism serves a dual purpose of investigating the specific use of these inhumane weapons and acting as a deterrent to their future use. More generally, I advocated for action across the disarmament agenda, on nuclear weapons, conventional arms and small arms and light weapons. I sought to revitalize the non-proliferation agenda and to advance measures to protect civilians and combatants from indiscriminate weapons. I was particularly pleased to welcome the adoption in July 2015 of the agreement on the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran — a testament to the value of diplomacy.
My tenure has coincided with unprecedented humanitarian needs across the globe and the highest level of forced displacement since the founding of this Organization. My advocacy for a more global, accountable and robust humanitarian system culminated in 2016 with the World Humanitarian Summit. The effort continues at the high-level plenary meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants to be held in September in New York. My overarching message is for global solidarity in response to the needs of our fellow human beings. This is a theme that I have tried to strike since the outset in advocating for the prioritization of human rights, beginning with support for the establishment of the Human Rights Council just as I took office and continuing with my campaigns for the abolition of the death penalty and an end to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as my Rights Up Front initiative. I am heartened, as I leave office, to see the human rights agenda reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals, in our peace and security strategies, and in our efforts to address violent extremism. While our dedicated human rights mechanisms still have an overly full agenda of issues, the effort to place human rights at the core of all our work is a concrete manifestation of the promise to put human rights up front in everything we do, as a matter of course.
When I arrived at the United Nations, I was struck by the gap between the enormous dedication of its staff and the weaknesses of the systems with which they work. Member States, too, sent me a clear message that they expected more transparent, accountable and effective stewardship of the Organization and its resources. In response, and to enable the United Nations to live up to growing demands and commitments, I prioritized institutional and management reforms. I took steps to strengthen the accountability system, including a focus on internal controls and oversight mechanisms and tools to promote transparency and integrity. These included the establishment of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, the implementation of a new internal justice system and an expansion of the senior managers’ compacts to include heads of peacekeeping and special political missions. I also introduced new human resource policies, including mobility. I pushed for the evolution of the Secretariat to a global organization underpinned by modern management practices and business processes. Many of these reforms come to fruition as I wind down my term and I am delighted to leave in place for my successor an Organization that is well prepared for its eighth decade and the more complex world to which it must respond.
I also sought to take advantage of the emergence of new communications technologies, new media and new actors on the global stage, harnessing the power of partnerships and using the convening power of the United Nations to bring a wide range of actors together in pursuit of responses to pressing global challenges. Multi-stakeholder initiatives were established to address challenges such as women’s and children’s health, sustainable energy and hunger. I sought to open the doors of the United Nations ever further to parliaments and to civil society organizations, which play such a vital role in advancing critical agendas at the national and global level.
It has been a remarkable decade for the United Nations. As someone who grew up knowing this Organization as a beacon of hope, it has been privilege to serve. I have worked alongside Member States and many dedicated colleagues around the world. Too many staff members have given their lives serving the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The best way to pay tribute to their sacrifice is to redouble our efforts. I have seen what transformation we can bring about when we pull together. But in my travels as Secretary-General, I have also seen despair, misery and hopelessness. Too often, these horrors are man-made. I have done what I can to ensure that the United Nations responds to the needs of the most vulnerable but that work is far from over. I will conclude my service at the end of this year and pass the baton to my successor, to whom I wish every success in what is, to quote the first Secretary-General, the most impossible job in the world. It is also the most uplifting.
Chapter II
The work of the Organization
A. Promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development
This reporting period marked the end of one era in the quest for sustainable development and the beginning of a new and even more promising phase in which there is a real chance for us to eliminate poverty, inequality and exclusion in all corners of the world. The global mobilization behind the Millennium Development Goals helped to lift more than 1 billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet. They generated new and innovative partnerships, galvanized public opinion and showed the immense value of setting ambitious goals. Yet the landmark commitment entered into by world leaders in the year 2000 — to “spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty” — was not fully achieved by the 2015 deadline.
Inequalities persist and progress has been uneven across regions, among and within countries, leaving millions of people behind. This is especially true where violence is reversing or impeding advances in development. The dramatic upsurge and relapse of conflicts in the past decade tremendously reduced the gains that were made. At a time of growing polarization and crises, a new era for sustainable development was needed. The experiences and evidence from the efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals demonstrated that we know what to do, but also indicated a need for deeper approaches that can tackle root causes and do more to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.
1. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
On 25 September 2015, world leaders gathered in New York to adopt the historic 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda is the product of one of the most inclusive and holistic processes in United Nations history. As the global framework for the next 15 years and a promise by Member States to “leave no one behind”, it encapsulates the global vision of the world we want to live in.
The Agenda is anchored on 17 Sustainable Development Goals. These goals commit all countries and stakeholders to (1) ending poverty in all its forms everywhere; (2) ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture; (3) ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages; (4) ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all; (5) achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls; (6) ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all; (7) ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and clean energy for all; (8) promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; (9) building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation; (10) reducing inequality within and among countries; (11) making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; (12) ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns; (13) taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts; (14) conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development; (15) protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, and halting and reversing land degradation and halting biodiversity loss; (16) promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels; and, finally, (17) strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. The Goals are accompanied by 169 targets.
This is an ambitious agenda, integrating the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, and addressing human rights and the interconnected root causes of poverty, hunger, pandemics, inequalities, environmental degradation, climate change, forced migrations, violence and extremism. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was built upon and expanded on the lessons learned from the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed commitments. It is reinforced by and reinforces several other global agreements reached in 2015 and the reporting period, including the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development.
The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 aims to guide management of disaster risk in development at all levels. It focuses on preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk through proactive measures and investments across all sectors, including education, health, agriculture, water and energy. The focus on increasing the number of countries with national and local disaster risk-reduction strategies by 2020 is a clear opportunity to complement national planning under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change.
These mutually reinforcing agendas represent a new departure. The challenge now lies in implementation. This cannot be achieved by any actor alone. Ambition at the global level needs to translate to action by all communities and nations, on the basis of locally owned, gender-responsive implementation strategies. The systematic integration of a gender perspective into national sustainable development plans, strategies and budgets needs to be a priority. Governments must drive the process. They must show leadership and ownership and align policies, legislation and resources with the Sustainable Development Goals. Tapping into the synergies among the goals will help to fast-track implementation. In this vein, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda commits countries to set the necessary policies and regulatory frameworks and it incentivizes changes in consumption, production and investment patterns. The Action Agenda also reiterates that the fulfilment of all official development assistance (ODA) commitments remains crucial and stresses the role of ODA in catalysing additional resource mobilization from public and private sources. It also welcomes the increased contribution of South-South cooperation to sustainable development.
Special efforts will be needed in the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing States. These countries, along with conflict-affected States, represent segments of the global community that face the biggest constraints on sustainable economic growth and development. While national leadership and ownership are critical, these countries depend on global partnerships for financial resources, policy advice and technical assistance. The Istanbul Programme of Action, the political declaration adopted at the midterm review of the Programme of Action, the Vienna Programme of Action and the Samoa Pathway are compacts that address the challenges and opportunities of these groups of countries. These dedicated programmes of action complement Agenda 2030. The Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries, to be operational in 2017, has the potential to strengthen national capabilities and provide expertise to least developed countries to achieve internationally agreed development goals.
Financing will also be key to implementation. The Economic and Social Council forum on financing for development was a key first step in this regard. As an input to that important discussion, the Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development produced a report that maps the more than 300 commitments and action items contained in the Addis Agenda, including the means of implementation targets for the Sustainable Development Goals. It creates a monitoring framework and presents data sources and tools to monitor their implementation in future years. Another important input was the first Global Infrastructure Forum, held by the multilateral development banks in Washington, D.C.
Implementation — and accountability for implementation — will also falter without quality, accessible and timely data. The Statistical Commission of the Economic and Social Council has agreed on a global indicator framework. The implementation of an indicator framework for monitoring and assessing progress will present a challenge in many countries, and national statistical capacities will have to be strengthened. At its forty-sixth session, the Statistical Commission established the High-level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-Building for Statistics for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to provide strategic leadership for statistical monitoring and reporting of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The data revolution is an important enabler for the global indicator framework. The Statistical Commission is already working towards the organization of a United Nations World Data Forum at the end of 2016 to strengthen the dialogue with a broad range of partners and stakeholders.
In view of the adoption of Agenda 2030, the annual annex to the present report entitled “Millennium Development Goals, targets and indicators: statistical tables” has been discontinued. In its place, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 70/1, paragraph 83, there will be an annual progress report on Agenda 2030 based on a global indicator framework to inform the high-level political forum. An annex entitled “Sustainable Development Goals, targets and indicators: statistical tables” will be included in that progress report.
2. The need for action on climate change
This reporting period saw a new sense of urgency as well as new hope for the most existential quest of our time, to combat climate change and reverse its effects where we can. Climate change represents the greatest threat to achieving sustainable development and the eradication of extreme poverty. The year 2015 was the warmest since modern record-keeping began. The five-year period 2011-2015 was the warmest on record. Carbon dioxide levels — the primary driver of climate change — surpassed 400 parts per million globally for the first time in recorded history. The science is crystal clear. So too are the increasingly visible effects in people’s lives. Each year, we see increasing evidence of the effects, particularly on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations. From the highly vulnerable island nations in the Pacific to the drought-stricken areas throughout the Horn of Africa, impacts of climate change are undermining the ability of developing countries to achieve sustainable development and in some cases threatening their very survival. Action on climate will reinforce action on sustainable development. Investments made under the climate agenda are investments in development. Global cooperation across all sectors of society is essential for meeting this challenge.
The reporting period witnessed the culmination of a 10-year effort on my part to contribute to the successful conclusion of an ambitious climate agreement. After the successful conclusion of my Climate Summit in 2014 in New York and the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Lima, I set two main objectives: to mobilize political will towards finalizing a new agreement in Paris at the end of 2015 and to catalyse ambitious action on the ground to reduce emissions and strengthen resilience. The engagement of Heads of State and Government during 2015 was also essential to finalizing an ambitious agreement. To that end, I convened leaders on two occasions to galvanize engagement at the highest levels in the lead-up to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties in Paris. These encounters resulted in a broad consensus among key countries and provided strong impetus for an agreement in Paris.
The adoption of the Paris Agreement on 12 December 2015 and the high-level signature ceremony for the Paris Agreement, on 22 April 2016, capped a remarkable year of multilateral achievements for people and the planet. It demonstrated the real commitment and ambition of all countries around the globe to mitigate climate change by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by and beyond 2020, and provides a solid foundation for the climate-resilient transformation of the global economy in a manner that is sensitive to human rights and gender equality.
Now it is critical to translate commitment into action. This transformation will help to secure a future that is safer, healthier and more prosperous for all. Action at every level, from the local to the global, must accelerate. We have no time to waste, and much to gain, by moving quickly down a lower-carbon pathway. Climate finance is critical for catalysing action on the ground and for building political trust. The definition of a politically credible trajectory for achieving the goal of $100 billion per year by 2020, and the full operationalization of the Green Climate Fund and the approval of its first projects by the Board of the Fund in November 2015, were crucial for the successful outcome in Paris.
Successful climate action is a multifaceted global challenge. Recognizing the importance of resilience and adaptive capacity, I also launched a new global initiative on climate resilience: A2R (Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape). A2R is a multi‑stakeholder partnership that focuses on accelerating action to strengthen climate resilience prior to 2020, particularly for the most vulnerable countries and people.
B. Maintenance of international peace and security
The past year’s efforts to prevent, contain and resolve violent conflict reminded us afresh of the necessity of the United Nations. The safety and prosperity of future generations was jeopardized by the failure of political leaders to govern peacefully and equitably and with respect for the rule of law; the continued diversion of resources from development to the waging of war; alarming disregard by warring parties for international human rights and humanitarian law; and a failure to speak out consistently against violations or to hold perpetrators accountable for crimes committed. Atrocity crimes continued to be a regular occurrence. Children bore arms instead of school books. People fled their homes in larger numbers than ever before. The social fabric of entire regions was put at risk. These trends have had terrible consequences for civilians, including in the Middle East and parts of Africa.
Consequently, the reporting period saw a surge in demand for United Nations efforts to prevent and manage conflict and to sustain peace. More peacekeepers were deployed than ever before in the Organization’s history. The demand for mediation support and good offices, including through special political missions, and the price tag for humanitarian assistance reached all-time highs. The unsustainability of this situation is clear.
This heavy burden of conflict could be measured qualitatively as well as quantitatively, in the form of increasingly complex conflict dynamics and deteriorating operating environments. In Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali, Somalia, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen, armed conflict continued to be intertwined with terrorism, with violent extremists exploiting national, regional and local vulnerabilities, including ethnic, religious, socioeconomic and political tensions. The rapid emergence of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), or Daesh, reshaped the violent extremist landscape and amplified the already substantial threat posed by older extremist groups such as Al-Qaida, Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab. In the past six months alone, ISIL carried out, inspired, or claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks in Bangladesh, Belgium, Egypt, France, Germany, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Turkey and the United States of America. There was also evidence that human-trafficking and migrant-smuggling groups were profiting from the movements of large numbers of refugees and migrants fleeing violence, persecution and disenfranchisement, exacerbating the suffering of those in search of safety and security.
These trends complicated the task of United Nations mediators attempting to broker inclusive political solutions. Peace operations struggled to operate effectively in non-permissive environments with high levels of ongoing violence. That 43 peacekeepers were killed and 75 injured in malicious acts between 1 August 2015 and 31 May 2016 demonstrates that peacekeeping is a dangerous, and sometimes fatal, endeavour. United Nations personnel and programmes in both mission and non-mission settings, including those previously assessed as low risk, faced complex, diverse and multifaceted security threats, arising from armed conflicts, volatile post-conflict environments, terrorism, civil unrest, violent crime, political crisis, grave human rights violations, humanitarian emergencies and frequent natural disasters. The number of direct attacks against United Nations premises and vehicles increased. Forecasts indicate that the combination of armed conflict with violent extremism will continue to shape the global security landscape.
The reporting period also saw important developments towards a more peaceful future, however. The adoption of Agenda 2030 and the three important peace and security reviews conducted in 2015 — on peace operations, on peacebuilding and on Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) — gave us a road map for collective action to prevent and resolve conflict. Because an increasing proportion of the extreme poor live in conflict-affected countries and 125 million people require humanitarian assistance, the world will not be able to reach the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030 without greater efforts at working on conflict — that is, finding political solutions through inclusive political dialogue that addresses the drivers of conflict. Greater efforts at working in conflict will also be crucial — that is, strengthening the delivery of services in protracted crises in remote locations and reaching the marginalized.
1. Conflict prevention and mediation
The first and clearest priority, an unambiguous lesson of the reporting period, is that conflict prevention and mediation need to be brought back to the centre of all United Nations engagements. The conflicts in the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen as well as the crisis in Burundi demonstrate the need for more, not fewer, of these activities. The large movements of refugees and migrants around the world also underscored the need to address the root causes of these movements and the conflicts that prompt them. It was also the central appeal of the three important peace and security reviews conducted in 2015 — on peace operations, on peacebuilding and on Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). Prevention is a responsibility under the Charter, one that must be shared by the United Nations, Member States, regional and subregional organizations, and civil society.
I continued to offer my good offices and to undertake conflict prevention, preventive diplomacy and mediation efforts during the reporting period in a wide array of contexts. The United Nations led mediation efforts in some of the most difficult conflict settings, such as Libya, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen. In other cases, it co-mediated with regional and subregional organizations, or supported initiatives led by those organizations. Throughout all this work, the United Nations insisted on the indispensable participation of women in peace processes and mediation.
My Special Envoy for Syria convened several rounds of intra-Syrian negotiations to seek an end to the conflict through a political transition based on Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) and the Geneva communiqué. Hopes for the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic tentatively improved with the cessation of hostilities on 27 February and an increase in humanitarian assistance, but progress remains slow and fragile. In Yemen, my Special Envoy continued efforts to promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The inter-Yemeni peace talks that commenced in April continue. While both sides have committed to reaching an agreement on an end to hostilities and a path towards the resumption of the political transition process, deep differences between the two sides remain. Ensuring the effective implementation of the agreement will require constructive engagement by all Yemeni parties, as well as strong regional support. Meanwhile, since the signing of the Libyan Political Agreement on 17 December 2015, some of the institutions envisaged, including the Presidency Council, have been formed. Efforts are now focused on broadening the basis of support for the agreement and for the bodies it created, as well as addressing the security situation, which remains a concern. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya is providing support to the Presidency Council and working to re-establish the Mission’s presence in Tripoli to enhance these efforts.
In Burundi, the security situation remained precarious, owing to a pattern of politically motivated and targeted violence connected to the ongoing political crisis. The Security Council requested me to provide my good offices and technical and substantive support to the mediation process, led and facilitated by the East African Community, as endorsed by the African Union. In the Great Lakes region, my Special Envoy, in close collaboration with my Special Representative for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, continued to support and monitor the implementation of national and regional commitments under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework in coordination with regional and subregional partners.
There was more encouraging news elsewhere. In Myanmar, the landmark elections of November 2015 transformed the country’s political landscape by bringing Aung San Suu Kyi and her party into power. As the new Government embarks on a national political dialogue process to unify the country, it faces major challenges in confronting entrenched attitudes, especially in Rakhine, and meeting the heightened expectations of its people. I shall continue to make my good offices available to Myanmar as it moves strenuously ahead to improve the lives of its peoples and make the peace process and future elections truly inclusive. In Colombia, the United Nations is preparing for the deployment of a special political mission, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2261 (2016), which will be responsible for the monitoring and verification of the laying down of arms, and be a part of the tripartite mechanism that will monitor and verify the definitive bilateral ceasefire and cessation of hostilities once the peace agreement is signed. In Cyprus, encouraging progress towards a comprehensive solution was made in the leaders-led negotiations facilitated by my Special Adviser.
Beyond these specific good offices efforts, I continued to strengthen United Nations regional capacities and to better position the Organization to deal with rapidly deteriorating crises and tense political environments in non-mission settings. United Nations regional offices for West Africa and the Sahel, for Central Africa and for Central Asia continued to serve as highly effective “forward platforms” for conflict prevention. The strengthening of the United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa is contributing to that Office’s ability to engage preventively in the region. Greater support was also provided to resident coordinators in non-mission settings, especially those facing tense political environments and rapidly deteriorating crisis contexts.
I also continued strengthening our relationship with the World Bank. The joint financing initiative with the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank announced in October 2015 in Lima is supporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Lebanon and Jordan, which are bearing a disproportionate responsibility in hosting refugees from conflict, especially from the Syrian Arab Republic. Given the full range of challenges faced by these host countries, there is a clear conflict prevention dimension to this innovative approach. Finally, I launched a policy discussion in the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination on integrating conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts into the Organization’s broader work to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Many of these efforts, however, were undertaken without meaningful regular budget resources. I regret that, during the reporting period, my case for bringing to an end the unsustainable reliance on extrabudgetary resources for vital prevention and mediation work did not meet more favour with Member States. I will continue to make the case at every opportunity.
2. Peace operations
The deployment of United Nations peace operations remained at its highest level in history during this reporting period. With nearly 125,000 uniformed and civilian personnel from more than 100 Member States deployed in 16 peacekeeping missions, and over 3,600 civilian staff working in 37 special political missions, the United Nations continued to make a tangible contribution to peace and security in many parts of the world.
A number of countries hosting peacekeeping missions saw progress over the past year: the successful elections in Côte d’Ivoire confirmed that the country was moving firmly towards lasting peace and ready to conclude the peacekeeping phase of the United Nations engagement; a peace agreement signed in Mali sets out a new vision for governance and security in the north; and, in the Central African Republic, the Bangui Forum and the subsequent elections paved the way for a new phase in the country’s transition from conflict. Nevertheless, other missions, such as the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, continued to face a number of difficulties, including with regard to host government consent and cooperation. In South Sudan, the agreement of August 2015 faced numerous implementation difficulties stemming from the leaders’ inability to overcome their differences. With respect to Western Sahara, in March 2016 the Mission saw the bulk of its civilian staff expelled from Laayoune at the request of Morocco, resulting in unprecedented challenges to fully carrying out mandated activities.
A growing number of peace operations faced extremely challenging operating environments classified as substantially, highly or extremely dangerous. Approximately 90 per cent of personnel in special political missions are working in countries experiencing high-intensity conflict. For example Afghanistan continued to endure higher casualties from a continuing conflict, a contracting economy with low growth and high unemployment, thereby fuelling migration flows, and a deepening of political divisions. My Special Representative provided support for peace and reconciliation initiatives at national and local levels. In Somalia, my Special Representative continued to work in close coordination with the Federal Government, regional leaders and international partners to harmonize views on key political processes such as the review of the Provisional Constitution and consultations on the 2016 electoral process. In Iraq, my Special Representative continued his good offices work with Iraqi leaders, civil society and others to promote a genuine and inclusive reconciliation process that reaches all levels of Iraqi society. Political dialogue, implementation of the Iraqi Prime Minister’s reform agenda, and addressing the economic and security situations all remain key requirements to ensure long-term stability in Iraq.
Compounding these security challenges, several peacekeeping operations are also operating in remote locations. In Mali, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission faces a deadly and persistent threat from terrorist armed groups, and while it is widely agreed that peacekeeping operations should not engage in counter-terrorism activities, this case demonstrates the need to provide peacekeeping operations with the requisite capabilities to protect themselves and implement their mandates in complex asymmetric settings.
On the support side, continued strides were made in the reporting period to take full advantage of technology to assist peace operations in implementing their mandates more effectively and safely and in making mission support more efficient and cost effective, and less labour intensive. There were further reductions in the spending and support costs per mission personnel and more than 70 per cent of mission personnel now benefit from one or more shared services arrangements. We also took significant steps to advance environmental issues in peacekeeping, developing a partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme for technical assistance and creating capacity to coordinate the overall environmental footprint of operations, in the energy, waste, water and waste water sectors, among others. Good environmental management is increasingly a central consideration in mission planning processes, and there are plans to introduce a system for monitoring and managing operational performance in this area across missions.
In order to better respond to the spread, intensity and evolving nature of conflict, I established a High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, whose report, released in June 2015, forged a new vision for peace operations. My response, issued in September 2015, set an ambitious but critically important reform agenda which the Secretariat has begun implementing. A Leaders’ Summit on Peacekeeping, on 28 September 2015, which I co-chaired with nine Heads of State and Government, reinforced the peacekeeping partnership by laying the foundations for a new, progressive and cross-regional vision for peacekeeping operations. At the Summit, some 60 Member States pledged over 40,000 police and military personnel, broadening the base of contributors to peacekeeping and reaffirming its universal character.
These initiatives sent an important political signal about the commitment to effective peace operations in a changing global landscape. Significant efforts were made to implement as many of the concrete ideas and commitments as possible during the reporting period. A central pillar of the reform agenda is strengthening the planning and conduct of peace operations. As part of this effort, over the past year the Secretariat has intensified efforts to improve the capabilities and performance of peacekeeping operations. This includes ensuring that uniformed personnel are trained and equipped to optimally respond to the operational challenges they face; strengthening a military performance evaluation framework which is accepted by all; and establishing command and control systems that are responsive and effective.
3. Protecting civilians
Tragically, this reporting period witnessed continuing brutality and grave violations of international humanitarian law as well as human rights abuses against civilians in many conflict settings. United Nations initiatives to protect civilians from such violations and abuses and ensure the enjoyment of their most basic rights took many forms. We provided support to Member States in developing and strengthening their capacity to prevent and respond to atrocity crimes, and ensure the rule of law, in full respect for international human rights law. The Security Council reiterated calls for compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law, as applicable, and for accountability for perpetrators of violations and abuses, including grave violations against children in armed conflict. There was significant progress in ending the recruitment and use of children by government armed forces, with advances in the criminalization of recruitment and in the establishment of age verification processes. The United Nations also engaged with several non-State armed groups listed in the annex to my annual report on children and armed conflict based in Colombia, Myanmar, the Philippines, the Sudan and South Sudan. Negotiations on action plans to end and prevent violations against children were especially effective where peace processes were ongoing or agreements were being implemented. On 15 May, the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia — People’s Army (FARC-EP) announced the decision to separate minors under 15 years of age from FARC-EP camps as well their commitment to develop a road map to complete the separation of all minors.
We made important strides in the past year with armed groups and parties to peace processes in addressing and ensuring accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. The joint announcement of 15 December 2015 by the Government of Colombia and FARC-EP on victims provides for the removal of amnesties for the most serious crimes, including conflict-related sexual violence. In Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and South Sudan, we advocated for and achieved concrete advances in the form of convictions, indictments, a framework for implementation and a code of conduct, respectively.
At the same time, we confronted emerging challenges and previously unforeseen threats. We observed a clear link between the rise of violent extremism and the most egregious forms of sexual violence being perpetrated by extremist groups. This is occurring in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, but also in Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. It includes rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage, forced pregnancy and forced abortion, often as forms of religious and ethnic persecution. The Security Council expressed its deep concern regarding this disturbing trend, expanding the sanctions framework for the suppression of terrorist financing to formally include ISIL, and condemning the abduction of women and children for sexual exploitation, trafficking and trading and to force the payment of ransoms. Within this context, it is also important to bear in mind that other parties to conflict, including non-State armed groups and State forces, continue to be responsible for acts of conflict-related sexual violence and other violations of their obligations under international humanitarian law, and to disregard the most basic human rights of civilians, the sick and wounded, and hors de combat soldiers.
In 2015, the Global Study and the high-level review of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security provided strong evidence that women’s empowerment and participation contribute decisively to the success of peace talks, to conflict prevention and economic recovery, as well as to the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance and the likelihood of sustainable peace. All three reviews recognized the centrality of the women and peace and security agenda for the United Nations work. Several recommendations are being implemented, including new initiatives aimed at building gender analysis capacity in peace operations, boosting women’s representation in peacekeeping, and tracking and scaling-up funding for initiatives related to women and peace and security. Many were reflected in Security Council resolution 2242 (2015), including the establishment of an informal expert group on women and peace and security, to allow the Council to take a more robust approach to the agenda in its own work, and ensuring women’s participation and leadership in developing strategies to counter terrorism and violent extremism.
Finally, with respect to the protection of civilians, I am horrified that some cases of abuse against civilians came from the very people sent to protect them: United Nations personnel and non-United Nations forces operating under a United Nations mandate. Sexual exploitation and abuse devastated the lives of victims and critically damaged global perceptions of the Organization. I took vigorous steps to combat this scourge, commissioning an independent review of our response in the case of the Central African Republic and, pursuant to its findings, appointing a Special Coordinator to strengthen our ability to prevent abuse and to respond to cases in a timely, transparent, measurable and visible way. In February 2016, I issued a report announcing additional measures to ensure greater oversight of operations and strengthen accountability in the areas of prevention, enforcement and remedial action to assist victims (A/70/729). Ensuring greater accountability is a collective endeavour and will require the full engagement of Member States.
4. Mission transitions
During the reporting period, three peacekeeping missions — the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire, the United Nations Mission in Liberia and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti — were undergoing a comprehensive reconfiguration process that will result in their drawdown and eventual withdrawal, and one special political mission, the United Nations Electoral Observer Mission in Burundi, concluded its mandate and drew down its operations in December 2015. Strategic assessments were planned (in Liberia and Haiti) or carried out (Côte d’Ivoire) during the reporting period, in order to effectively manage the transition, to help avoid any uncertainty, power vacuums, or relapse into conflict, and to prepare host governments and remaining United Nations actors for the post-mission phase. These reviews will contribute to a shared understanding of the critical residual peacebuilding needs that will guide engagement throughout and beyond the transition process.
Building legitimate institutions, promoting good governance and establishing representative and inclusive State authority are key considerations for the durable consolidation of peace and stability, and pave the way for the progressive drawdown and exit of peace operations. For these efforts to be effective, however, securing the strategic consent and ownership of the host Government and national counterparts is critical. In the Central African Republic, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission began working with national counterparts and international partners to develop a compact aimed at defining joint priorities and fostering a spirit of mutual accountability in efforts to sustain peace.
5. Sustaining peace
Ground-breaking resolutions were adopted by the General Assembly (resolution 70/262) and the Security Council (resolution 2282 (2016)) on the review of the peacebuilding architecture. “Sustaining peace” as defined in the resolutions must now be at the core of United Nations actions, meaning that the prevention of violent conflict must be prioritized at every stage of a crisis and in all pillars of the United Nations work. In the resolutions the two organs also emphasize partnerships with regional and subregional organizations and international financial institutions and the importance of inclusivity, including of women and youth, and people-centred approaches for successful peacebuilding. I am invited to report to the General Assembly at its seventy-second session on the implementation of the resolutions, including with options for the adequate and sustainable financing, through assessed and voluntary contributions, of the peacebuilding activities of the United Nations system. I very much welcome this request and urge the Member States to take the necessary decisions to ensure solid resources behind our efforts to sustain peace.
The Peacebuilding Commission is a key platform to sustain peace in conflict-affected countries, and continues its engagement in Burundi, the Central African Republic, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and Sierra Leone. During the reporting period, the Commission has embraced more flexible working methods, strengthened partnerships with regional and subregional organizations and continued to highlight peacebuilding needs in the post-Ebola recovery period from the national and regional perspectives. The Commission highlighted thematic policy and regional priorities, including cross-border and transnational challenges, financing for peacebuilding, youth and gender issues and transitions, and discussed peacebuilding needs and lessons learned in several countries, including Burkina Faso, Papua New Guinea and Somalia.
The Peacebuilding Fund allocated $77.9 million to 14 countries in 2015, including significant allocations to priority peacebuilding activities in countries such as the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, the Niger and Somalia. Also in 2015, for the first time, the Fund successfully met my target by allocating 15.7 per cent to initiatives that focused principally on gender equality and women’s empowerment. I directed the Fund to support the United Nations renewed engagement in Sri Lanka to help the new Government to build trust and confidence among the people on its reconciliation and accountability/transitional justice agenda. Unfortunately, the Fund had its third weakest year since initial pledges in 2006, receiving $53.5 million in contributions from donors. As a result, it will not be able to reach its annual allocation target of $100 million in 2016 without additional donor contributions. This reality means that we are missing critical opportunities to ensure strategic coherence and enable politically risky but necessary endeavours. It also exposes the gap between norms and reality in preventing conflict and sustaining peace. Closing that gap is not just desirable, it is a matter of life and death for millions.
6. Democratic transitions and elections
Providing electoral support to Member States continued to be a priority during the reporting period. The United Nations provided electoral assistance to 67 countries. Many of these were cases where United Nations good offices were also being carried out. Emphasis was placed on the use of measures to strengthen confidence in electoral processes and help to bring about peaceful outcomes. United Nations support continued to include technical advice to Member States in designing inclusive electoral systems, reforming electoral frameworks that enjoy the broad support of national stakeholders, and putting in place electoral management bodies that are, and are perceived to be, impartial, honest and capable. Gender considerations were systematically included in all electoral assistance activities and policies.
In Guinea, the United Nations helped to facilitate the resumption of the deadlocked political dialogue between the Government and the opposition on the electoral process, paving the way for the timely organization of the 2015 presidential election. Support to Nigeria’s fifth general elections, in 2015, involved high-level diplomatic engagement. My Special Representative for Central Africa also sought to defuse high tensions surrounding some of the elections in that region through the deployment of multi-agency teams to monitor the situation on the ground, report on developments, and support good offices interventions, for example in the Republic of the Congo. In Burkina Faso, the United Nations accompanied a delicate and often tense transition process that ended with the inauguration of President Kaboré in December 2015. My Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel also exercised good offices to promote peaceful elections in the Niger in March-April 2016. At the request of the Government of France, experts were deployed to support the preparation of a new register of voters that may be used for a referendum on the future status of New Caledonia within the framework of the Nouméa agreement.
The United Nations continued its technical support to the electoral process in a number of countries under a mandate from the Security Council. In Côte d’Ivoire, my Special Representative built confidence between the parties, thus allowing them to overcome the thorny issues that risked delaying the electoral process. The United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire provided much-needed logistics support. The United Nations Electoral Observer Mission in Burundi observed all major electoral events in Burundi in 2015 and found that “the overall environment was not conducive for an inclusive, free and credible electoral process”. These conclusions were consistent with those of the African Union and subregional organizations.
Some of the contexts in which assistance was provided were very complex and fragile. In the Central African Republic, we assisted national stakeholders in ensuring that the 2015/16 presidential and legislative elections were credible and peaceful. Technical support was provided to electoral reform and preparations for the upcoming parliamentary and district council elections in Afghanistan. The Organization also continued its technical electoral support to Haiti in the complex and fraught political environment leading up to the 2015/16 presidential and legislative elections.
Beyond elections, the United Nations assists democratic transitions by providing political facilitation and supporting national efforts to strengthen accountability and the rule of law and to advocate for space for civil society organizations, which regrettably face increasingly harsh restrictions in a growing number of countries. Parliaments remained key partners during the reporting period. Two landmark United Nations agreements — the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction — explicitly referenced their role in implementing and monitoring Governments’ international commitments. A large number of United Nations entities continued to provide support to many national parliaments around the world.
C. Development of Africa
Africa’s development priorities identified in the African Common Position on the post-2015 development agenda were enshrined during the reporting period in several continental and global landmark agreements, including the African Union Agenda 2063, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Effective implementation of these agendas will require coherence and complementarity between global, continental, regional, national and local efforts. The continent has embarked on the first ten-year implementation plan for the African Union Agenda 2063. The Agenda’s people-centred approach promises to enhance inclusive economic and social progress and its emphasis on agriculture development, infrastructure development and industrialization provides critical drivers for job creation and poverty eradication. The United Nations system is supporting the efforts of the African Union, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and African regional economic communities for the effective implementation of the new agendas.
The slowdown in the economies of major trading partners and low commodity prices decreased growth projections for Africa during the reporting period. However, the remarkable economic performance of past years was sustained in part through improving macroeconomic management and economic diversification. Africa continued to make progress in the implementation of NEPAD. African countries have also continued their efforts to promote regional integration, including through the Tripartite Free Trade Area, which provides a strong foundation for the establishment of the Continental Free Trade Area by 2017.
The partnership between the United Nations and the African Union deepened considerably, including through the adoption of the Framework for a Renewed United Nations-African Union Partnership on Africa’s Integration and Development Agenda 2017-2027 and through efforts to finalize a joint United Nations-African Union framework for an enhanced partnership in peace and security. The United Nations continues to support the Silencing the Guns initiative of the African Union to end all wars in Africa by 2020.
Both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063 recognize the importance of peace and stability, not only as critical enablers but also as important components of sustainable development. In line with this aspiration, Africa has also continued, with the support of the United Nations and development partners, to address emerging challenges to peace, security and development, such as the rise of terrorism and violent extremism as well as the growing number of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons. In this regard, African countries continue to attach great importance to tackling the root causes of conflict such as youth unemployment, inequality, and economic and social exclusion, including through the African Peace and Security Architecture and the African Governance Architecture. Recognizing the critical needs and role of women, the African Union declared 2016 the African Year of Human Rights with Particular Focus on the Rights of Women.
D. Promotion and protection of human rights
It pains me that the basic rights of so many people were violated or remained unfulfilled in the past year. The rights of asylum seekers, refugees and migrants were a top concern. Thousands lost their lives during journeys in search of safety, protection and a more dignified life. Refugees and migrants were faced with alarming levels of discrimination and abuse in countries of origin, transit and destination and inadequate respect for human rights standards. The forced displacement of people being at levels higher than at any time since the founding of the Organization, this became a pressing global issue. Cooperation between States on migration, greater sharing of responsibility for refugees, and gender-responsive, human rights-based policies and laws on migration must improve significantly if we are to protect basic human rights and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In recognition of the gravity of the situation, the Human Rights Council held an enhanced interactive dialogue on the human rights of migrants in February. I issued a report in May (A/70/59) urging protection for refugees and migrants and calling, among other things, for a global compact on responsibility-sharing for refugees, the development of another global compact for safe, regular and orderly migration and a global campaign against xenophobia. I call on Member States to take decisive steps forward at the high-level meeting on these challenges to be held in September 2016.
Racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance go beyond the issue of migration. They remain too common all over the world. The United Nations endeavoured to enhance equality and counter all forms of discrimination, including on the grounds of indigenous or minority identity, gender identity and sexual orientation, age, disability, income and albinism. The International Decade for People of African Descent was launched in 2015. Discrimination against women continues in law and in practice, many women suffering multiple forms of discrimination. Accelerating progress will require the universal ratification and full implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; removal of discrimination in the law; increased investments in gender equality and women’s human rights; strengthened accountability mechanisms; participation by women in all levels of decision-making; and addressing inequalities.
The impact on human rights of growing inequalities, both within and between States, remained of grave concern to me. In view of the 2030 Agenda’s core objective of reducing inequalities and realizing human rights for all, the past year featured intense efforts to integrate human rights in development and the economy. The United Nations endeavoured to keep human rights concerns front and centre of discussions on monitoring, review and accountability and on financing for development. This focus extended to the United Nations early warning efforts, in the form of initial steps towards an early warning system that recognizes links between conflict and violations of economic, social and cultural rights. Indeed, these elements are at the core of the Rights Up Front initiative that, in consultation with the General Assembly, has been implemented further. The initiative seeks to achieve existing United Nations mandates for prevention and early warning by bringing the three pillars of United Nations action — peace and security, development and human rights — together, through cultural change, operational change and strengthened engagement with Member States. The recent adoption of substantially identical resolutions by the General Assembly and the Security Council on the review of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture further strengthened this approach by recognizing that sustaining peace should flow through all three pillars of the United Nations engagement at all stages of conflict.
The past year saw appalling disrespect for the protection of fundamental human rights and basic tenets of international humanitarian law in the context of conflicts around the world. Disregard for the core principles of distinction, proportionality and humanity in conflict situations by both States and non-State actors led to immense suffering, including in the Syrian Arab Republic, Yemen and Iraq. Nevertheless, important progress was made in integrating a human rights perspective in our peace and security work. The Security Council members increasingly called upon human rights experts to brief them, and included human rights analysis in their decision-making processes. The resolutions adopted on the review of the peacebuilding architecture encouraged Member States participating in the universal periodic review to consider the human rights dimensions of peacebuilding. The High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations underscored the importance of human rights and the protection of civilians in peace operations. In follow-up, the United Nations took steps to ensure regular public human rights reporting, to strengthen human rights training for peacekeeping personnel, and to consolidate specialized protection functions within human rights components of missions. Our commitment to early warning and protection materialized through rapid responses to human rights crises. Steps were taken to swiftly deploy multidisciplinary teams to countries where crises were developing or risked developing. The renewed commitment of the United Nations to conflict prevention is also an acknowledgment of the important role that human rights analysis can play in identifying tools for preventive action.
With respect to the principle of responsibility to protect, I call on Member States to ensure that legal obligations are fully upheld in practice and that the highest possible standards of respect for human rights are maintained.
Member States continued to look to the United Nations to provide independent, impartial and authoritative assessments of situations of concern, through human rights commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions. The Human Rights Council mandated missions relating to Boko Haram, Libya, the Syrian Arab Republic, Eritrea and South Sudan. Combating impunity and strengthening accountability and the rule of law remained a leading priority. Member States worldwide requested United Nations support on constitutional and legislative reforms, administration of justice and law enforcement, gender-sensitive reparations, witness protection measures and transitional justice initiatives and in relation to measures taken to prevent and counter violent extremism and to combat terrorism. This support enabled Governments and their civil society partners to align legal and judicial systems with States’ human rights obligations. The abolition of the death penalty remained a human rights priority. The Organization’s efforts to reach this objective included the biennial high-level panel at the Human Rights Council on regional efforts.
As the actors with primary responsibility for fulfilling human rights obligations, Governments must act on their duties. Guaranteeing space for civil society to fulfil its complementary role is fundamental. It was thus very worrying that, during the reporting period, the global trend continued of limiting space for civil society organizations. The freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly were seriously challenged in many countries and in all regions. There were egregious reprisals against those who cooperated with the United Nations. Challenges frequently emerged during elections, campaigns by human rights defenders, social movements and political protests and in relation to counter-terrorism measures. The United Nations firmly defended the public freedoms that characterize democratic societies through advocacy and legal advice at the global, national and local levels.
The Human Rights Council addressed chronic, emerging and ongoing human rights crises in the reporting period. These included the dialogue on migrants and two special sessions to address the atrocities committed by Boko Haram and to prevent further deterioration of the human rights situation in Burundi. During its three regular sessions, the Council took action to prevent further deterioration of human rights violations, including against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar, and in Ukraine, South Sudan, the Sudan, Yemen and Libya, while monitoring situations in the Central African Republic and Côte d’Ivoire on a regular basis. The universal periodic review maintained full participation in the course of its second cycle. The Council’s independent special procedures mandate holders increased in number, new mandates being established concerning albinism and the right to privacy. Mandate holders conducted 76 country visits in 2015. The human rights treaty bodies benefited significantly from the additional meeting time endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 68/268, resulting in the review of 173 State party reports; the adoption of views and decisions on over 160 individual communications; eight country visits by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and national-level activities in more than 40 countries.
The General Assembly, at its seventieth session, adopted 48 human rights-related resolutions, 30 of which were adopted without a vote. I regret that a number of resolutions traditionally adopted by consensus were voted upon at that session, including those on the rights of the child; strengthening the role of the United Nations in enhancing periodic and genuine elections; and human rights defenders, while other resolutions traditionally enjoying widespread support required unprecedented levels of political compromise to be finally adopted without a vote, for example, the resolution on prevention of torture.
E. Effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts
We reached a critical juncture in the past year. Humanitarian needs outpaced anything we have seen before, stretching our responses to the breaking-point. During the reporting period, the United Nations and its partners appealed for $19.9 billion to assist 82 million people in 38 countries. This represents a tripling of the number of people targeted for humanitarian assistance in the past 10 years. While funding reached a record high of $10.6 billion in 2015, the resulting shortfall was also the largest ever. Forced displacement also reached unprecedented levels: the number of persons internally displaced owing to conflict and violence was 40.8 million by the end of 2015, and the global refugee total reached 20.2 million.
The year was dominated by five major emergencies, in the Central African Republic, Iraq, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen. In the Syrian Arab Republic, some 13.5 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance, 6.5 million were internally displaced and nearly 4.6 million were refugees. In Yemen, approximately 82 per cent of the population (21.2 million people) needed humanitarian assistance. A total of 346 natural disasters were recorded in 2015, claiming an estimated 23,363 lives, affecting 90.3 million people, displacing more than 19.2 million people in 113 countries, and causing damage worth over $65.2 billion.
The 2015/16 El Niño, one of the worst on record, has had devastating humanitarian impacts, leaving more than 60 million people in need of humanitarian assistance due to exacerbated droughts, floods and other extreme weather events. On 20 May, I announced the appointment of two Special Envoys on El Niño and Climate to increase attention to these challenges. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction brings disaster reduction into the mainstream of humanitarian as well as development action in an unprecedented way.
In the light of the strains on the humanitarian system, I convened the first World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul on 23 and 24 May. Three years of intensive, inclusive multi-stakeholder consultations paved the way for the Summit. Other inputs included the High-level Panel on Humanitarian Financing and my own report entitled “One humanity: shared responsibility” (A/70/709), which laid out five core responsibilities critical to delivering better for humanity. Member States, United Nations agencies, civil society, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and affected people met in Istanbul to mark a turning point in respect of what needs to change to better address and reduce humanitarian need, risk and vulnerability over the longer term.
While the scale and duration of humanitarian crises around the world has stretched the humanitarian sector to its limit, global challenges such as political impasses in the face of crises, climate change, fragility and growing economic inequality, or pandemics, point to increasing humanitarian need in the future. This is a crucial time to invest in enhancing local capacities, reducing risk and building effective and inclusive institutions, especially in fragile contexts. We must also invest in women and girls, who are often affected differently and disproportionally by humanitarian crises. There was an unequivocal call for action at the Summit.
Member States and other stakeholders announced commitments and initiatives within the framework of the Agenda for Humanity and the five core responsibilities in order to drive change and reduce human suffering today and tomorrow. Humanitarian actors must continue to deliver predictable, timely and relevant assistance to affected people fully in accordance with humanitarian principles, and stronger efforts in prevention and preparedness, as well as in achieving sustainable results that contribute to reducing need, must be prioritized.
The World Humanitarian Summit and the Agenda for Humanity provided an historic opportunity to put affected people at the centre, but also remind us that we must transcend the humanitarian-development divide by working to reduce people’s vulnerability and risk.
F. Promotion of justice and international law
This reporting period saw the first completion by an ad hoc tribunal of its mandate, with the delivery of the Butare appeal judgment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The Security Council acknowledged the Tribunal’s achievements, including its contribution to the process of national reconciliation and the restoration and maintenance of peace. The closure of the Tribunal for Rwanda does not signify impunity for those whose cases were not heard by the Tribunal. Indeed, one of the fugitives (Ladislas Ntaganzwa) was arrested in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and transferred to Rwanda in March for trial. Meanwhile, the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia concluded the trials of Radovan Karadžić and Vojislav Šešelj. Mr. Karadžić was convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes while Mr. Šešelj was acquitted of all charges. At the close of the reporting period, the Tribunal remained seized of two appeals and two trials of senior political and military figures. The International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals continues the jurisdiction and essential functions of the Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
There were important developments also at the International Criminal Court. The Court concluded the trial of Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, who was convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison for crimes against humanity and war crimes (murder, rape and pillaging) in the Central African Republic. Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, who faces charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion in Timbuktu, Mali, expressed his intention to plead guilty to the charges. This is the first case to be exclusively focused on the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against cultural property.
At the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia proceedings are ongoing in all three chambers. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon is conducting the trial in absentia of five persons accused of perpetrating the attack which killed Rafiq Hariri and 22 other persons. The Tribunal also delivered judgment in the first contempt trial against a corporate entity before an international criminal tribunal, with the acquittal of the corporate entity and a journalist. The Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone, which continues the jurisdiction of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, is also continuing its work.
The principle of complementarity in the Rome Statute demands that, in the first instance, prosecution of serious crimes of international concern take place at the national level. In this context, the United Nations is assisting in accountability efforts in South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Sri Lanka, in collaboration with Member States and regional organizations. In South Sudan, technical assistance is being provided to the African Union Commission for the establishment of the Hybrid Court for South Sudan to address international and national crimes committed since December 2013. This is the first occasion on which the United Nations has been tasked with providing technical assistance to a regional organization in the establishment of a hybrid tribunal. In the Central African Republic, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission is assisting the transitional authorities in establishing a special criminal court. With respect to Sri Lanka, the United Nations stands ready to assist in implementing the Government’s proposal to establish a judicial mechanism to investigate allegations of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, which were noted by the Human Rights Council.
The International Court of Justice in 2015 marked its seventieth anniversary as the main judicial organ of the United Nations. During the reporting period the Court delivered five judgments, three on preliminary objections and two on the merits. In the case concerning Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), the Court found a violation of Costa Rica’s territorial sovereignty and navigational rights. In the case concerning Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), the Court held that Costa Rica had violated its obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment concerning the construction of the road. In both cases, the Court found that there was no breach of substantive environmental obligations.
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women issued its general recommendation No. 33 on women’s access to justice. It stresses the importance of women’s access to justice in diverse legal systems and all areas of law for all women, irrespective of economic or social status, political background, geographical location, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity.
The topic of oceans has been high on the agenda. Member States have continued their efforts to implement international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This is key to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, as it provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources. The first global integrated marine assessment provided a critical scientific basis for this work. The Organization also took steps towards the development of an international legally binding instrument under the Convention on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.
G. Disarmament
The elimination of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction remains a central but elusive objective of the United Nations. Despite commitments from Member States, there has been limited progress on this long-standing goal. For nuclear weapons, this is largely due to growing tensions between nuclear-armed States and sclerotic disarmament machinery. I am deeply disappointed that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is not yet in force 20 years after it was negotiated and that a fissile material treaty has not been negotiated. The fourth nuclear test by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in January 2016 and its ballistic missile launches remain a source of serious international concern.
The inability of the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach a substantive outcome created significant uncertainty over prospects for nuclear disarmament as well as for a Middle East zone free of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction. I have made clear my readiness to support efforts to promote the inclusive regional dialogue necessary to achieve the goal of a Middle East zone.
I was particularly pleased to welcome the adoption on 14 July 2015 of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the EU 3+3 (China, France, Germany, Russian Federation, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America) and the Islamic Republic of Iran. This historic accomplishment — a testament to the value of diplomacy — marks an important turning point in the international community’s relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran and benefits nuclear non‑proliferation. I am confident that this agreement will lead to greater mutual understanding and cooperation on the many serious security challenges in the region and beyond.
I appreciate the efforts of the Open-ended Working Group on nuclear disarmament in taking forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations and hope that those will produce an outcome that is inclusive and forward-looking.
I have condemned any use of chemical weapons and remain fully committed to their elimination. The Security Council demonstrated its resolve in this matter, adopting in August resolution 2235 (2015), by which it established an Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism to identify those involved in the use of chemicals as weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. The United Nations will continue to support the Mechanism so that it can finish its task in an impartial, professional and timely manner. Accountability matters not only to this case but as a future deterrent to the use of these inhumane weapons. The taboo against the use of chemical weapons has been broken and accountability is required to repair it.
Protecting civilians and combatants from indiscriminate weapons is a fundamental mission for the United Nations. Humanitarian disarmament thus continues to be a priority. I am encouraged by the interest in the challenges posed by lethal autonomous weapons systems. I welcome the engagement by the General Assembly and the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons on the urgent humanitarian challenge posed by improvised explosive devices, and the growing support for a political commitment to reduce the devastating impact posed by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. During the reporting period, the United Nations continued to support the universalization of and adherence to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and the Convention on Cluster Munitions. I welcome the Dubrovnik Action Plan adopted in 2015 by the First Review Conference of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. These conventions are an example of partnership between States, the United Nations and civil society. Their implementation continues to be affected by donor resources, however.
I am deeply concerned by irresponsible arms transfers and the continued large-scale illicit trafficking of weapons. Some States made important decisions to deny arms exports, including decisions based on the formulation in the Arms Trade Treaty of an “overriding risk” that the export would contribute to undermining peace and security or be used to commit or facilitate serious acts of gender-based violence or violence against women and children. I am pleased that 2015 saw further growth in the number of ratifications of the Treaty.
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was a defining moment for global efforts to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit arms trade: the Agenda included a specific target to significantly reduce illicit arms flows by 2030.
As our world becomes increasingly dependent on information and communications technology, the potential security implications continue to grow. In 2015, a group of governmental experts, as mandated in General Assembly resolution 68/243, produced a report on norms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour in the cybersphere. The next group of governmental experts will meet late in 2016 and should enhance this baseline framework.
Similarly, the importance of outer space means we must ensure that its benefits can be enjoyed by all States. I am encouraged by efforts to implement transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space, including through enhanced cooperation between the First and Fourth Committees of the General Assembly.
I remain particularly concerned by the growing nexus between terrorism and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security. The Nuclear Security Summit in Washington in 2016 endorsed a United Nations Action Plan, focused on two relevant United Nations instruments: Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The United Nations can play a key role in advancing this issue, including by engaging all Member States.
I am pleased to note that the United Nations has provided capacity-building assistance to Member States upon request to, inter alia, improve the control of small arms and light weapons and promote the effective implementation of both Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) and the Arms Trade Treaty. Outreach to civil society has been intensified. We also commemorated the seventieth anniversary of the first General Assembly resolution, which established the goal of eliminating atomic weapons.
H. Drug control, crime prevention and combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations
Confronting transnational threats, organized crime, terrorism, violent extremism and asymmetric violence has become an everyday matter for many United Nations personnel working in mission and non-mission settings around the world. These issues force the United Nations to redirect attention and resources at the expense of other fundamental priorities. In many contexts, the United Nations is challenged to “stay and deliver” in some of the most non-permissive and unstable environments, while ensuring the safety and security of personnel. This is not an easy task. Eight out of the 11 countries that face the highest levels of threat from Al‑Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups host United Nations peace operations; seven of those eight missions are political missions, which do not have peacekeeping troops at their disposal and therefore face distinctive security challenges. Violence threatens more than the physical security of United Nations personnel. When staff are unable to operate or forced to leave, we cannot continue to deliver on our core mandate, the search for long-term, sustainable and inclusive political solutions which address the root causes of violence.
Underscoring how terrorists have taken advantage of political, social and economic cleavages in society to establish and advance their cause, most terrorist activities during the reporting period occurred in countries mired in new or old conflicts. A rising number of conflicts saw terrorism result in large-scale humanitarian crises and refugee flows. The rise of terrorist groups fuelled by violent extremist ideologies is also a growing concern. Focusing on short-term law enforcement and security measures without addressing the drivers of violent extremism will not, by itself, be successful. For this reason, I presented a Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism (A/70/674), which contained more than 70 recommendations to Member States and the United Nations system. The Plan proposes the development of national plans of action that identify context-specific drivers of violent extremism to more effectively address them. In addition, an agenda of forward-looking recommendations to strengthen international counter-terrorism cooperation was presented in my biennial report to the General Assembly on the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (A/70/826 and Corr.1), marking its tenth anniversary. The report aimed to inform Member State consultations ahead of the General Assembly’s fifth review of the Strategy, which was conducted on 30 June and 1 July, just after the submission of the report. Those consultations are expected to produce a resolution adopted by consensus that will chart the work of the Organization on counter-terrorism and preventing violent extremism for years to come.
Pending the review, work continued during the reporting period on the implementation of all four pillars of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Many United Nations entities assisted Member States in enhancing their capacities to counter terrorism and prevent violent extremism through a strengthened and coherent, “all-of-United Nations”, approach, including through the Integrated Assistance for Countering Terrorism initiative and the capacity-building implementation plan for countering the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. Support was also provided to Member States in building the capacity of their criminal justice, border control and law enforcement systems, in particular to more effectively address the newly emerging challenges relating to terrorism, such as the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters, the growing nexus between terrorism and transnational organized crime and the financing of terrorism, including through trafficking in cultural property.
While significant progress in countering piracy off the coast of Somalia has been made, it remains fragile and reversible as credible reports suggest that commercial ships remain a target of Somali pirates and smaller vessels remain vulnerable. Long-term security off the coast of Somalia needs to be built up first on shore, where capacity-building efforts have yet to produce lasting and sustainable results in tackling the root causes of piracy such as a fragile economy, youth unemployment, weak judicial capacity and weak governance structures. The United Nations has been providing support to Somalia and the region through a Trust Fund to Support Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off the Coast of Somalia.
The General Assembly held a special session on the world drug problem in April. In the lead-up, many United Nations entities supported Member States with evidence and analysis of the impact of the world drug problem. In the resulting outcome document (resolution S-30/1), the Assembly recognized the need for a comprehensive, integrated and balanced approach to addressing the multifaceted challenges presented by drugs around the world. In doing so, it emphasized the importance of scientific and evidence-based approaches to supply and demand reduction, while addressing cross-cutting themes such as the protection of human rights, health, mainstreaming gender and age perspectives in drug-related policies and identifying new and emerging threats posed by new psychoactive substances. At the special session, the General Assembly laid the groundwork for the 10-year review of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action of 2009 relating to the world drug problem, the main policy document guiding international action in this area. I look forward to an inclusive dialogue that is open to new ideas and approaches in the lead-up to that review.
The United Nations continued to support Member States in preventing crime and reforming their criminal justice systems in line with international standards and norms. The first United Nations Chiefs of Police Summit reiterated the importance of United Nations policing in building and strengthening the capacities of host-State institutions to prevent and address transnational organized crime as well as situating policing in broader legal and security sector reform. Having supported the revision and adoption of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) and other instruments, the Organization is providing technical assistance to address the global prison crisis, promote justice for children and enhance police and justice responses to violence against women and girls. The United Nations Joint Global Programme on Essential Services for Women and Girls Subject to Violence is supporting countries in providing greater access to a coordinated set of essential and quality multisectoral services for all women and girls who have experienced gender-based violence. The Global Programme on Violence against Children is assisting countries in implementing their international commitments.
In support of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 69/314 and in line with its mandate the United Nations conducted the first global wildlife crime threat assessment, highlighting the vulnerability to organized crime of protected species of wild fauna and flora. United Nations entities continue to work together towards a common strategy on combating this illicit and tragic trade by addressing issues relating to demand and supply, creation of robust legal frameworks and effective international cooperation. My report to Member States on the implementation of resolution 69/314 (A/70/951) is available.
Ten additional States ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption during the current biennium, bringing the number of States parties to 178. The implementation review mechanism completed more than 100 reviews and in November 2015 States parties launched the second cycle of the review mechanism.
The Organization continued to support the implementation by States of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto by providing enhanced technical assistance to counter all forms of organized crime, including the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons, especially in the context of conflict areas and the Mediterranean. The Security Council called on all Member States to do everything in their power to combat human trafficking, especially for sexual purposes, citing the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, the Lord’s Resistance Army and Boko Haram as prime perpetrators. Efforts were also stepped up to ensure policy coherence while addressing illicit financial flows, issues relating to foreign fighters, and the recovery of stolen assets. The latter are an important part of the discussion on financing for development as the international community embarks upon implementing the 2030 Agenda, which explicitly recognizes the links between governance, the rule of law, justice, security and sustainable and equitable development for all.
Chapter III
Strengthening the Organization
The General Assembly made important strides in revitalizing its work during the reporting period, supported by the Secretariat where appropriate. For instance, it brought forward the elections of non-permanent members of the Security Council and members of the Economic and Social Council, introduced innovations in the selection process of my successor and enhanced its interaction with civil society. Intergovernmental negotiations continued on Security Council reform even as a commonly agreed formula continued to elude the membership as a whole. The Secretariat, meanwhile, continued to modernize and improve conference services provided to Member States, including through the use of new technologies to improve the timeliness and quality of multilingual documentation.
A similarly energetic use of technology and multilingual platforms, both traditional and digital, was applied to public information outreach activities during the reporting period to popularize the achievements and activities of the Organization, particularly the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change. To mark the seventieth anniversary of the Organization, a year-long commemoration was undertaken. The various observances of the seventieth anniversary helped to connect the Organization to local and grassroots audiences worldwide and to engender further support for the United Nations and its work.
Following a decade of comprehensive management reform, the Secretariat is now well positioned to operate as a modern, efficient and integrated global organization. Through Umoja, the new enterprise resource planning system, business processes have been standardized and automated across our global operations. This is an opportunity to review the way we do business and to simplify and streamline processes and consolidate the fragmented administrative architecture of the Secretariat. In the hope of strengthening our stewardship of the resources Member States entrust to us, my proposal for a new global service delivery model is being developed and will be presented to the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.
The new staff selection and managed mobility system was launched starting with POLNET (political, peace and humanitarian job network) on 1 January 2016. This system provides a more strategic and global approach to human resources management while building an adaptable global workforce of staff with diversified skills and experience. Significant progress has been made in reducing the fragmentation of information and communications technology resources, which in turn enhances the Organization’s ability to support Umoja and to comply with technology standards and best practices. There has also been progress on modernizing the office environment. The first phase of flexible workplace implementation started in January 2016.
During my tenure, the internal system of administration of justice which forms part of the accountability architecture of the Organization was established. The General Assembly envisaged a system that, inter alia, ensures the accountability of managers and staff members alike. The report of an independent panel and my comments on its assessment of the system are the subject of separate reports for the Assembly’s consideration during the seventy-first session.
Enterprise risk management has been a key part of my vision of a strengthened Secretariat. It facilitates effective strategic decision-making across the Organization and stimulates healthy dialogue at the most senior levels on critical issues in an environment of growing complexity and uncertainty. Following a Secretariat-wide risk assessment, the Organization is taking steps to mitigate the top strategic risks to the Organization in areas such as organizational structure; organizational transformation; strategic planning and budget allocation; safety and security; extrabudgetary funding and management; and human resources strategy, management and accountability.
One of the most critical risks facing the Organization is the current security environment. Improvements in security management practices and policies have proved effective in containing casualties: a lower number of personnel have been killed as a result of violence since 2011, despite the increasing number of attacks against the United Nations. Tragically, however, in addition to the high losses of uniformed personnel mentioned in paragraph 37, 15 civilian personnel lost their lives as a result of acts of violence, mostly due to crime and civil unrest. The Organization has also focused on strengthening its duty of care to staff deployed in high-risk environments, balancing it with the implementation of critical United Nations programmes and mandates. In the global context, the Organization is determined to pursue effective and coordinated responses, consolidating its resources through the integration of all the security resources of the Secretariat under the Department of Safety and Security, and enhancing collaboration with host Governments towards greater security of United Nations personnel and accountability for perpetrators of crimes against United Nations personnel.
Partnerships
The United Nations has long recognized the power of partnering as a specific element of its work. Partnerships should include not only Governments but also businesses, private philanthropic foundations, international organizations, civil society, volunteer groups, local authorities, parliaments, trade unions, research institutes and academia. Multi-stakeholder arrangements have proved successful because they expand on traditional partnerships by significantly increasing available resources, improving the effectiveness of their use and increasing policy and operational coherence. Such partnerships can channel commitments and actions, and their success depends on assigning roles, responsibilities and clear accountability. The multi-stakeholder partnership model has emerged as a promising way to share burdens, catalyse action and bring all relevant actors to bear in addressing specific problems.
Multi-stakeholder partnerships are critical for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Engagement with business is proving especially important. Through our main initiative for mobilizing the private sector — the United Nations Global Compact — more than 8,000 companies are advancing principle-based business practices and advancing United Nations goals. A majority of companies surveyed indicate that they are aware of the Sustainable Development Goals and a similar majority state that they are willing to implement the Goals in their business plans. A clear trend is emerging: business organizations, including investors, seeing themselves as legitimate and involved actors in the broad sustainable development agenda. The Paris Agreement on climate change marks another milestone in terms of our ongoing collaboration with the international business community — and likewise opens new opportunities for partnership and cooperation between the United Nations and business on this most urgent global issue.
Enhancing the integrity and accountability of the United Nations in working with the private sector is essential. The revised guidelines on United Nations-business cooperation are serving as a critical framework for coherent and transparent private sector engagement as the United Nations implements the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. These Guidelines on a Principle-based Approach to the Cooperation between the United Nations and the Business Sector also refer to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, with clear language on transparency and stakeholder accountability.
Chapter IV
Conclusion
Thus concludes my final annual report on the work of the Organization. I have sought to leave the Organization better prepared for the immense challenges ahead, able to serve its entire membership and “we the peoples” in every corner of the world. This report has made clear that the need for the United Nations is greater than ever and seems likely to grow. The Organization is engaged on the full range of pressing global issues across the world. The coming decade will be critical if we are to deliver on our promises to ensure a life of dignity for all and to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and the threat of irreversible climate change. We must follow through on a host of ongoing reforms across all three pillars of the Organization. But we must not limit ourselves to the ongoing reforms. Continued innovation, openness and creativity will be required if the United Nations is to stay ahead of the changing global landscape and to remain a venue for principled collective action. I encourage Member States to make responsible use of this indispensable institution, with its universal membership and global reach. I look forward to working with them until my very last day in office.

Chapter I
Introduction
I am deeply honoured and humbled to be at the helm of the United Nations at this critical time. In this annual report on the work of the Organization, which reflects on the first few months of my term and the last few months of my predecessor’s term, my aim is to offer a candid view of the world today and a realistic vision of how we can better deliver on the promise of the United Nations.
The world we live in presents a mixed picture of progress, challenges and opportunities
The United Nations was established to prevent war and human suffering by binding us together through a common rule-based international order. Today that order is laden with contradictory trends, and a clear assessment must be made if we are going to address these challenges effectively.
Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. More children, both boys and girls, are achieving greater levels of education and more women are entering the political world than ever before. This progress represents concentrated efforts by United Nations Member States to work towards these and other development goals. Yet after years of decline, the number of conflicts is on the rise and they are lasting longer, fuelled by the spread of terrorism and violent extremism, transnational criminal networks and deep regional divisions. The threat of famine in several countries, resulting from violence compounded by drought, lurks just around the corner. These contradictory trends are exacerbated by international power dynamics that are in flux. As we move towards a multipolar world order composed of multiple and shifting centres of power, there is an added feeling of unpredictability.
Now more than ever, multilateral action is needed to find effective solutions to this mix of challenges.
While progress on development indicators is moving ahead, the risks to global stability may be accelerating, affecting these hard-earned achievements. Climate change is creating deserts where once there was farmland; it is also generating extreme weather that threatens lives, livelihoods and infrastructure and leads to critical shortages of water. The planet’s population will grow to nearly 10 billion people by 2050, two thirds living in cities that could be left unprepared for such rapid growth unless urban leaders grasp this opportunity to prosper by utilizing concentrated habitats to build more efficient infrastructures.
People are on the move, to cities and all parts of the world, in search of opportunity and safety. Population displacement and migration on a scale not seen since the Second World War bear witness to enduring challenges grounded in escalating conflicts and systemic inequalities. While some countries have been willing to open their arms to people in need, others have reacted by succumbing to deep national and international tensions and polarization.
Inequality and exclusion underlie many of today’s challenges
Inequality and exclusion underlie a great many of today’s challenges. Globalization has brought immense gains in the fight against poverty worldwide and has improved living conditions nearly everywhere. But it has been cruelly unfair: as wealth has increased, so too has its asymmetry, leaving millions behind in all parts of the world. Both developed and developing countries, North and South, face greater inequality and marginalization now than they did 20 years ago. Unless we work together, the coming decades are likely to drive poverty more deeply into fragile low-income countries, pushing them even further onto the sidelines, while even larger numbers of people struggling with poverty live in middle-income countries. Furthermore, this sense of exclusion is not limited to the poorest countries but is vividly on the rise in developed countries as well, fuelling trends of nationalism and a lack of trust in national and multilateral institutions. Our hard-won collective progress towards combating poverty and promoting common security is newly at risk.
Countries and institutions are struggling to fully deliver
Threats to global stability are frequently rooted in weak infrastructure and failing institutions in fragile States. Where States cannot provide basic protections and services to their people, the likelihood of violence, pandemics or violent extremism increases dramatically. We must collectively invest more to help countries build inclusive institutions and resilient communities capable of thriving in a globalized world.
Overwhelmed, a significant number of States across the world are struggling to effectively address today’s major challenges and deliver the services needed by their populations. Tensions are exacerbated by a lack of opportunities and by a strong sentiment among many peoples — their youth especially — that they are being excluded by the very institutions meant to serve them. Few countries or institutions appear to have a long-term vision to meet peoples’ needs or strategies to manage today’s interlinked crises, instead finding themselves entangled in reactive responses.
The United Nations and many other international institutions deserve credit for their achievements, but may also be perceived as bureaucratic and remote.
Demonstrating multilateralism matters more than ever
We need to rekindle faith in multilateralism and confidence in the United Nations as the place where States and civil society can come together to face the most pressing challenges in the world today.
The interconnected nature of today’s global trends unequivocally demonstrates that countries cannot manage these risks alone. Acting together is the most effective way to fight climate change, global terrorism and the threat of new pandemics and is the only way to manage forced displacements and migratory flows in a humane manner.
Countries cannot manage these risks alone
Member States clearly recognized this commonality when they adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, two landmark achievements all the more remarkable for coming in a period of stark division in international responses to other challenges.
Along with the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, these multilateral agreements constitute the most important frameworks for guiding us along the pathway to a world where more people can enjoy freedom from want and fear. We can succeed only if we work in greater unison. Multilateralism is not optional. It is the most effective vehicle, whether regional or global, for achieving the goals of peace, inclusive sustainable development and human rights for all.
United Nations reform is essential
The United Nations has a proud record of achievement in keeping peace, improving human well-being and advancing human rights and the rule of law. But the Organization came into being at a particular moment in history. While its animating principles continue to stand the test of time, its day-to-day structures and practices are no longer well adapted to current challenges. The world needs a more effective, nimble and accountable United Nations to manage the crises of the twenty-first century.
My assessment of the world we live in demonstrates that we need to respond to interlinked global risks in a less fragmented and reactive manner. If the United Nations is to remain relevant and reliable, we must vigorously enact proactive reforms that are motivated by the objective of achieving better results for those most affected.
One of our main goals in steering the reform agenda must be to engage more effectively on prevention. For too long, our reactive responses towards threats to peace and security have been too slow, allowing crises to worsen so that effective action becomes more difficult. We know that preventing a crisis is much less costly and more effective than reacting to one. We know that catastrophic natural disasters can wipe out in seconds development gains that took years to achieve. We know from painful experience that wars destroy societies and that protracted crises keep generations locked in perpetual vulnerability. This must change.
I have called for a shift in approach, with a less reactive posture, towards a more robust approach to prevention. Prevention means doing everything we can, across a broad range of engagements and activities, to help countries avert the outbreak or worsening of crises that result in massive human suffering. Prevention is the common thread running through the interwoven fabric of my reform efforts. Both the 2030 Agenda and the sustaining peace resolutions (General Assembly resolution 70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282 (2016)) demonstrate strong support for a holistic approach to prevention; the best prevention is sustainable and inclusive development. While these two approaches are complementary, the 2030 Agenda remains the primary architecture within which the sustaining peace resolutions provide a solid framework for enabling the United Nations to concentrate on support for the planning and delivery of specific aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals as they pertain to peace.
I have set in motion several related reform processes. All aim to make the Organization’s approaches more integrated and coherent, reflective of a more comprehensive understanding of the greatest risks facing the world, and more securely financed. The reforms will foster stronger and more accountable leadership, cutting away many of the burdensome administrative rules that hamper quick, nimble responses to crisis situations. They will increase and strengthen the partnerships we need to deliver meaningful change on the ground. Last but not least, I am fully committed to ensuring gender parity and greater geographic diversity across the Organization in order to better reflect and serve the peoples of the world.
The responsibility for preventing human suffering and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals rests with the Member States, but the United Nations has a vital supporting role to play. My reform agenda will make the United Nations a better partner for Member States in meeting their responsibilities.

We must harness these forces as we serve the global common good. I look forward to working with Member States and stakeholders everywhere to build a stronger, more effective United Nations that can deliver today and for generations to come.
Chapter II
The work of the Organization
A. Promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is
an unparalleled achievement
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents an unparalleled achievement in setting objectives for the international community. It marks a paradigm shift towards a comprehensive and integrated vision of inclusive sustainable development, applicable to all people in all countries and explicitly anchored in human rights. To ensure that actions follow this vision, more must be done to incorporate the Sustainable Development Goals into national plans and strategies, establishing performance baselines and effective statistical capacities.
I am committed to ensuring that the success of the Agenda is measured by the yardstick of improvement of the well-being and prospects of the poorest, most excluded and most vulnerable people in society. Countries and stakeholders confirm that the Agenda’s core promise — to leave no one behind — must underpin the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations is undertaking cross-cutting efforts to support national actors in implementing this commitment through support for laws, policies and programmes and the ratification of international treaties. These include measures to eradicate poverty, combat discrimination and uphold equality for all.
Leaving no one behind was the theme of the 2016 high-level political forum on sustainable development, which serves as the central platform for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. In a clear signal of their commitment and of the universal character of the Agenda, countries from all regions and levels of development are outlining national priorities and approaches to include the Sustainable Development Goals in their development plans and strategies. Almost a third of the Organization’s membership has volunteered to report on progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda.
The following challenges are faced by countries and vary enormously by region and other factors:
(a) Persistent poverty and inequality;
(b) Economic fragility;
(c) Unemployment, especially among youth;
(d) Unsustainable patterns of production and consumption;
(e) Unsustainable use of natural resources;
(f) Impacts of current conflicts and lingering effects in post-conflict situations;
(g) Vulnerability to disasters and the consequences of recent disasters;
(h) Climate change;
(i) Lack of resources;
(j) Institutional shortcomings: defects in rule of law, tax evasion and corruption;
(k) Limited space for civil society.
The Sustainable Development Goals are for the whole of society
To meet these challenges, the successful implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals depends on national actions and on forging multilateral partnerships with Governments and non-governmental organizations, strengthening collaboration between national and local-level entities and promoting inclusivity in decision-making processes. The Sustainable Development Goals offer a new opportunity to demonstrate a commitment to serving people and building trust in political leadership. Key individual contributions are needed from experts, scientists in particular. Science is critical for understanding and identifying synergies and trade-offs among the Sustainable Development Goals, and an independent group of scientists has begun work to prepare the Global Sustainable Development Report for the 2019 high-level political forum. The United Nations is also soliciting expert opinions on advancing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and leveraging its holistic nature.
Cooperation on achieving the 2030 Agenda is working its way across the United Nations system. The Economic and Social Council partnership forum is a critical space for sharing the perspectives and contributions of all partners, while the New Urban Agenda adopted at Habitat III in October 2016 addresses the manner in which cities are planned, financed, governed and managed. The 2017 Ocean Conference brought people together to formulate tangible solutions on such areas as marine pollution, climate change, ocean acidification and ocean governance. In addition, it will be critical for developed countries to deliver on both official development assistance (ODA) and climate finance commitments.
1. The challenge of climate change
Climate change is undeniable; the science is beyond doubt and
human influence is clear
Climate change is an overriding megatrend, with a multiplier effect on desertification, displacement of people, weather-related disasters and water scarcity and pressures on other natural resources. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has demonstrated in a series of exhaustive and authoritative reports, climate science is beyond doubt and human influence is clear. I am intensifying high-level political engagement aimed at limiting temperature rise to well below 2 degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius. I am rallying the United Nations development system behind Member States as they pursue climate action, mobilizing resources to support the implementation of national climate action plans and strengthening partnerships through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation. I also intend to convene a dedicated climate summit in 2019 to mobilize political support.
2. Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals
Despite the halving of the global poverty rate since 2000, intensified efforts are required to boost incomes, alleviate suffering and build the resilience of those still living in extreme poverty, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. While the proportion of humanity living in poverty is lower, some 700 million people still live in extreme conditions, and progress has not included a decline in inequality. Poverty as a percentage of population is deeply persistent in the least developed countries, although the largest number of people trapped in poverty live in middle-income countries.
In view of the variability of purchasing power parity, our efforts to eradicate poverty globally require a focus on all levels, from the least developed to the middle-income nations. Nevertheless, with the current economic growth trajectory, nearly 35 per cent of the population in the least developed countries may still be living in extreme poverty by 2030 (see figure I).
Figure I
Progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 1
One of the keys to creating decent jobs and reducing poverty will be the promotion of structural transformation towards more productive and green activities. Structural transformations can generate resources for social protection that is designed to assist those who are unable to escape poverty with their own resources. Strong national ownership of the development agenda is critical.
Efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition have advanced significantly since 2000. The proportion of undernourished people worldwide declined from 15 per cent in the period 2000-2002 to 11 per cent in the period 2014-2016. Yet ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition for all will require continued and focused efforts, especially in Asia and Africa. Tragically, famine threatens four States today, caused by drought and conflict.
Donor aid has increased but more is needed. A significant achievement in 2016 was the rise in net ODA from member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)/Development Assistance Committee by 8.9 per cent in real terms to $142.6 billion, a new peak. An increase in aid spent on refugees in donor countries boosted the total. But even when refugee costs were removed from the calculation, aid rose 7.1 per cent.
3. Data and statistics on the Sustainable Development Goals
In 2017, the Statistical Commission adopted the global indicator framework to monitor progress towards the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda. Tracking progress on the Sustainable Development Goals requires the collection of an unprecedented amount of data disaggregated at all levels, which poses a major challenge for national and international statistical systems. The global statistical community is working to modernize and strengthen statistical systems to address all aspects of the production and use of data on sustainable development.
To this end, the first United Nations World Data Forum, held in South Africa in January 2017, brought together key stakeholders to discuss innovations in capacity-building. Furthermore, the High-level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-building developed the Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data, which provides a framework for addressing the capacity needs of national statistical systems and innovative solutions for achieving the full 2030 Agenda.
In February 2017, the General Assembly adopted the recommendations of the open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (resolution 71/276) to measure progress against the global targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. As a result, the simultaneous and coherent measurement of disaster-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework is now possible, reducing the reporting burden on countries.
Gender statistics will play a critical role in monitoring progress on gender equality and women’s empowerment across the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations is working collaboratively with other global, regional and national actors (including national statistical offices) to enhance the availability and use of gender statistics to support the accelerated implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and achieve transformative results for women and girls.
4. Means of implementation
The ambitious and complex 2030 Agenda can be achieved only if countries have the means to pursue the goals. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development identifies ways to unlock the necessary resources and investments. In its first substantive report, the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development concluded that the current global growth trajectory would not deliver the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030. However, it found that national actions and international cooperation could help change the global trajectory and support countries in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. A major undertaking of the Task Force in 2016-2017 was building a comprehensive catalogue of progress on more than 300 commitments and actions agreed by Member States.
The financing required to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals is estimated to be on the order of trillions of dollars annually. The redirection of capital flows can include efforts to attract, leverage and mobilize investments of all kinds — public, private, national and global. Nevertheless, there are theoretically enough savings in the global economy to drive this transformation, and the benefits will flow back to investors.
Strengthening the capacity of developing countries to formulate more effective and efficient tax systems is a critical element in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters has been working on a number of products, including training and in-country assistance, that will help countries to ensure appropriate taxation and in particular to counter tax evasion. In another initiative, the United Nations, OECD, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have jointly launched a new Platform for Collaboration on Tax.
The goal of enhanced development cooperation is to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed, landlocked and small island developing countries, to implement programmes and policies to end all dimensions of poverty. The Development Cooperation Forum, an inclusive multi-stakeholder platform, is the primary locus for discussing efforts to improve the quality, impact and effectiveness of development cooperation. It is used by Southern partners to share their experience, good practices, solutions and challenges among themselves and with a range of actors. In that context, the Government of Argentina, in collaboration with the United Nations, will host a high-level symposium on South-South and triangular development cooperation in Buenos Aires in September 2017.
5. Strengthening implementation
The challenge now lies in coordinated and coherent implementation by
Member States, non-governmental organizations and partners across
the United Nations system
The 2030 Agenda provides a vision for development; the challenge now lies in its implementation. It is critical to mobilize adequate financial and non-financial support, ensure the effectiveness of multi-stakeholder partnerships and maintain a relentless focus on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The General Assembly requested me to prepare concrete proposals, and my vision includes planning for collective results, linking functions with funding. Member States have reaffirmed the complementarity and mutually reinforcing nature of the Sustainable Development Goals with peace and security and human rights, as well as with work streams under the sustaining peace agenda.
6. Regional dimensions
Increasingly, regional and subregional groupings of countries are identifying solutions to their common development challenges, while regional institutions are being called upon to work collectively with Member States to develop regional strategies and approaches, not only on cross-border issues but also on more traditional issues of economic, social and environmentally sound development.
In 2017, each regional commission engaged with Member States to adopt, align and integrate the 2030 Agenda into their national development frameworks and convened a regional forum for sustainable development that will inform the high-level political forum.
7. Countries in special situations
Each country faces specific challenges, and the most vulnerable countries deserve special attention. The United Nations continues to support the implementation and follow-up to the Istanbul Programme of Action (least developed countries), the Vienna Programme of Action (landlocked developing countries) and the Samoa Pathway (small island developing States), as well as the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The United Nations has also played an important role in establishing the Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries; the challenge now is to fully operationalize the Bank in seeking to fulfil Sustainable Development Goal target 17.8.
8. Haiti
In a step welcomed by Member States, the United Nations has initiated a new approach to the cholera crisis in Haiti (see A/71/620), consisting of two tracks. Track 1 consists of intensified efforts to upgrade the water and sanitation systems, while track 2 provides a package of material assistance and support for those Haitians most directly affected by cholera. My Special Envoy for Haiti is guiding the implementation, which is already under way; however, obtaining adequate funding to support the new approach remains a key challenge.
9. Effects of crime on development
Crime continues to erode growth and development outcomes as well as peace and security prospects for countries of all income levels. In the context of providing sustainable financing for development in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the United Nations has intensified its strategic approach, whereby crime prevention is considered a fundamental determinant of sustainable development. This includes building the capacity of Member States to combat illicit financial flows, prevent corruption and strengthen anti-money-laundering efforts.
10. Natural disasters
Over the past decade, economic losses resulting from natural disasters have reached nearly $1.4 trillion, hindering economic growth and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Investment in resilient communities and green infrastructure for schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, water and sanitation, energy, transport systems and housing is an imperative more critical than ever before, as is investment in effective, multi-hazard early warning mechanisms. This is an important aspect of my prevention-oriented reform agenda.
11. Forests
The global focus since 1992 has been to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. However, in a ground-breaking decision in January 2017, the United Nations Forum on Forests set a target to increase global forest area by 3 per cent by 2030. The United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030 (General Assembly resolution 71/285) provides a global framework for actions at all levels to sustainably manage all types of forests and trees outside forests and to halt deforestation and degradation. It features a set of six global forest goals and 26 associated targets to be reached by 2030, all of which are voluntary. The global forest goals and targets support the objectives of the international arrangement on forests and aim to contribute to progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and other international forest-related commitments.
Crime affects all aspects of development and forest management is no exception. The work of the United Nations in addressing wildlife and forest crime focuses not only on strengthening the law enforcement, criminal justice and legislative capacity of Member States but also on improving the livelihoods of vulnerable rural groups, such as local communities relying on natural resources and ecosystem services.
12. Empowering vulnerable social groups
With its central commitment to ensure dignity for all, the 2030 Agenda recognizes the contemporary global risks of rising inequality, discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. It also recognizes that people who are vulnerable must be empowered, including all women, children, youth, persons with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, older persons, indigenous peoples, refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants.
In response to dramatically rising numbers of people in search of safety or opportunity, the General Assembly convened a high-level plenary meeting on 19 September 2016 to address large movements of refugees and migrants, at which it adopted the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1). The Declaration sets out steps towards adopting two major compacts in 2018:
(a) A global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration;
(b) A global compact to more equitably share the responsibility for hosting and supporting refugees.
At the same meeting, my predecessor launched the “Together” campaign, a coalition of Member States, civil society organizations and the private sector that aims to strengthen social cohesion, counter xenophobia and promote positive narratives about refugees and migrants.
As global populations are growing older, the Organization is creating a forum for dialogue on the challenges and opportunities of ageing. Strong stakeholder input around disability-inclusive development also led to the effective integration of important commitments in the New Urban Agenda, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The number of young people is also growing, and the United Nations is broadening its strategy to more effectively account for the role of youth, including young women and men, in peacebuilding and humanitarian action, as well as to ensure identification of cross-pillar linkages.
My High-level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment identified purchasing goods and services from women-owned businesses as one of the primary drivers of progress. Corporations and Governments are also targeting companies owned by women in their procurement practices, while the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, covering 31 organizations and bodies, has prioritized purchasing from women-owned businesses.
B. Maintenance of international peace and security
1. Adapting to new conflicts
Today’s conflicts pose complex challenges for the Organization. For us to be better prepared and effectively respond to these demands, we must reinvigorate our approach to include:
(a) Fortifying our capacity to build political solutions to existing threats and emerging challenges;
(b) Ensuring that State and institution-building strengthen legitimacy through inclusion and attention to grievances;
(c) Upholding the Organization’s impartiality;
(d) Making effective use of the Secretary-General’s good offices through mediation support.

United Nations peace operations are among our strongest tools for maintaining peace and containing conflict. There are currently 16 peacekeeping operations and 36 special political missions around the world (see figure II). The vast majority of our staff serve in volatile security environments. In peacekeeping contexts, the protection of civilians has become a central mandate, which can also place United Nations personnel in danger. In 2016, 117 military, police and civilian peacekeepers died in service, while 7 United Nations civilian personnel serving in peacekeeping and special political missions lost their lives in Afghanistan, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Somalia and the Sudan. By 30 June 2017, an additional 41 United Nations personnel had died in service.
United Nations peace operations: facts and figures as at 30 June 2017
A. Peacekeeping operations
There are currently 112,303 United Nations peacekeeping personnel in 16 operations, comprising:
• Uniformed personnel: 95,553
◦ Troops: 80,067
◦ Police: 11,982
◦ Military observers: 1,543
◦ Staff officers: 1,961
• Civilian personnel: 15,153 (as at 28 February 2017)
◦ International: 5,004
◦ Local: 10,149
• United Nations Volunteers: 1,597
• Countries contributing uniformed personnel: 127
Fatalities in peacekeeping operations and special political missions in the reporting year: 165
Fatalities in all peace operations and special political missions since 1948: 3,599
Financial resources approved for peace operations, 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017: $7.87 billion
B. Special political missions
There are currently more than 8,000 personnel in 36 special political missions, primarily civilian, some military guards, military observers and police, comprising:
• 13 field-based missions
• 10 special envoys and advisers
• 13 sanctions panels and monitoring groups
In the reporting period, the Electoral Assistance Division deployed over 60 electoral missions as well as missions conducted to provide capacity-building support to regional organizations.
The United Nations must go beyond reacting to events and build anticipatory relationships with national and regional partners to prevent conflict. Prevention requires addressing the root causes of conflict across the three pillars of the United Nations: peace and security, human rights and inclusive development.
To bring us closer to a United Nations that is agile and able to deliver results in complex environments, I initiated a review of the peace and security architecture of the Secretariat. I strongly endorse the central message of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations to place political solutions at the centre of our work. We are also breaking new ground with the creation of the Office of Counter-Terrorism (General Assembly resolution 71/291).
2. Women, peace and security
The women, peace and security agenda is critical for preventing conflict and shaping more effective responses to today’s crises, and the United Nations must lead by example. I am dedicated to ensuring effective follow-up to the gender-specific recommendations emanating from previous reviews and the sustaining peace resolutions of 2016. I am currently urgently looking at how to increase the number of women appointed in United Nations-led or co-led mediation processes and in peacekeeping and special political missions (see figure III). The United Nations publication Guidance on Gender and Inclusive Mediation Strategies was issued during the reporting period to offer practical strategies for more inclusive and gender-responsive mediation. At a conference on United Nations peacekeeping, held in London in September 2016, more than 60 Member States pledged to increase women’s participation at all levels of peacekeeping operations. Women currently make up 26 per cent of head of mission and deputy head of mission positions, the highest proportion ever achieved, but we are still far short of gender parity.
Figure III

3. Youth, peace and security
Recent Security Council resolutions have spearheaded a growing focus on harnessing young people’s contribution to sustaining peace. The ongoing progress study on youth, peace and security is documenting the positive contribution of young women and men through in-depth consultations with youth. Further research needs to be done to better understand the implications of technology on growing youth unemployment and how technology can be harnessed in youth education.
4. Use of my good offices: preventive diplomacy and mediation
I am fully engaged in offering support in seeking peaceful solutions to disputes through the use of my good offices. Once the looming risk of violence emerges, my special envoys and representatives are often among the first responders. Working regularly with regional actors, my Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel played a critical role during the post-election crisis in the Gambia in support of mediation that resulted in former President Jammeh’s decision to cede power in a peaceful manner. My Special Representative heading the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy in Central Asia is committed to offering his good offices to facilitate negotiations on transnational water resources. My Special Representative for Central Africa continues to promote inclusive political dialogue and provide good offices in Gabon, the Congo, Chad and Cameroon. The peacekeeping operation for the Central African Republic is working with the African Union to implement the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation, including measures to prevent intercommunal violence. I have called upon India and Pakistan to find a peaceful solution to tensions and have reiterated the availability of my good offices to assist in any way necessary. I also rely upon a pool of readily deployable experts at Headquarters and the Standby Team of Senior Mediation Advisers. Their technical knowledge has provided extensive support not only for my envoys but also for regional and national initiatives. I have also personally exercised my good offices in several contexts since my appointment and intend to continue to do so.
Engagement in preventing and ending grave violations against children can constitute an entry point for dialogue and mediation. State and non-State parties have pursued commitments to end grave violations against children. Together with the United Nations Children’s Fund and others, the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict supports the implementation of the May 2016 agreement between the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia — People’s Army on the separation of children associated with the armed group, as an observer and guarantor. Working with my Special Representative, the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed to making progress in preventing the recruitment of children into the country’s armed forces.
5. Democratic transitions and elections
The importance of accompanying electoral processes with preventive diplomacy was demonstrated over the year. In Ghana, the good offices of my Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel were critical in bringing about a peaceful denouement to electoral tensions. Coordination with regional and international actors, particularly the Economic Community of West African States, was central to avoiding violence. In Afghanistan, the United Nations supported key reforms to strengthen the electoral process, including the election of three women to the election commission. The conclusion of the electoral process in Haiti in early 2017, with the support of the United Nations, paved the way for the return to constitutional normalcy and political stability.
In contrast to these successes, political tensions rose in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as the expiry of President Kabila’s second term approached in December 2016. The peacekeeping mission mandate was refocused to support the protection of civilians and the implementation of the agreement brokered by the Conference épiscopale nationale du Congo, made up of national Christian leaders. Significant support from the international community will continue to be required to allow the organization of credible and peaceful elections by the end of 2017.
6. Crisis management
United Nations peace operations are increasingly deployed earlier than previously to prevent, contain or help end violence. The imperative to prevent the further escalation of violence may dictate the need for the presence of United Nations missions even when a viable political solution is weak or absent. Experience has demonstrated that no matter how well equipped or robust, peacekeeping cannot effectively fulfil protection of civilian mandates without a political strategy or plan supported by the parties and by regional and international stakeholders.
This was apparent across a number of peacekeeping theatres. The United Nations mission in the Central African Republic has intervened on many occasions to prevent communal violence from spiralling out of control, averting major massacres. The mission in South Sudan has struggled to protect civilians against a backdrop of intensified hostilities between the parties to the conflict and an array of crippling obstructions erected by national authorities. The deployment of a regional protection force has generated minimal progress in improving the situation because of a lack of government cooperation. Nevertheless, while falling short in certain serious instances, the United Nations mission is protecting and sustaining hundreds of thousands of people every day. Multiple discussions within and statements by the Security Council, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development have failed so far to produce a clear way forward for a cessation of hostilities and a revitalization of the political process.
Ensuring that peacekeepers have the right capabilities and the political will to protect civilians is critical. In Mali, delays in generating critical military assets have limited the United Nations mission’s ability to fulfil the robust and proactive mandate authorized in June 2016. While the mission has pursued tireless efforts through mediation to support the implementation of the peace agreement, protracted disagreements and a lack of trust between signatory parties has stalled progress, further contributing to the deteriorating situation. A framework to strengthen commitment and better deliver on civilian protection mandates is under development.
Achieving negotiated settlements during full-blown hostilities, taking into account complex local, regional and international interests, has proven challenging in mission and non-mission settings alike. In the Syrian Arab Republic, the inability to reach agreement has allowed violence and human suffering to fester for far too long. Negotiations for a political transition in the Syrian Arab Republic resumed under United Nations auspices and were facilitated by my Special Envoy in January 2017. Yet on the ground, relentless assaults on civilians continue, causing massive displacements that threaten stability in the region and beyond. In Yemen, despite the efforts of my Special Envoy, the parties have not returned to the negotiating table. In Afghanistan, my Special Representative continues to support reconciliation initiatives within a prolonged humanitarian crisis. Progress towards a political solution in Burundi has been similarly slow, owing largely to the reluctance of parties to engage without preconditions.
7. Sustaining peace
General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on sustaining peace have expanded the notion of peacebuilding. Previously seen as a purely post-conflict endeavour, peacebuilding aims to prevent the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of violence in order to sustain peace throughout a conflict cycle.
My forthcoming report on sustaining peace will set out the implications of this holistic approach, including links to broader reforms. My prevention platform will be a central element and will support a more integrated, strategic and coherent approach among the three pillars of United Nations work: peace and security, development and human rights.
We are operationalizing the concept of sustaining peace, where appropriate. The Secretariat is supporting the Peacebuilding Commission’s working methods to bring together Member States, regional and subregional organizations, civil society and international financial institutions to address a broad range of country-specific, cross-border and regional situations. Immediately after the peaceful resolution of the post-electoral crisis in the Gambia, a United Nations assessment mission, a visit by the Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission and the quick disbursement of grants from the Peacebuilding Fund were critical in ensuring support to the new Government’s efforts to consolidate stability.
In Liberia, at the request of the Security Council, the United Nations developed a peacebuilding plan through a tripartite United Nations, European Union and World Bank mechanism to direct the transition out of peacekeeping. In the Central African Republic and Mali, the United Nations began developing community engagement strategies to build local capacity and prevent and mitigate intercommunal tension and conflict.
Steady progress in Côte d’Ivoire, Haiti and Liberia has paved the way for the planned drawdown of peacekeeping operations in those countries in 2017-2018. An attempted army mutiny in Côte d’Ivoire in May 2017 signalled that the Government must address grievances both within the Ivorian security sector and more broadly to sustain peace consolidation in the country. In Haiti, a smaller specialized peacekeeping operation will build on the work done by its predecessor in support of the rule of law. Nevertheless, the withdrawal of a mission does not mark the end of the road towards sustainable peace but rather the reconfiguration of the Organization’s presence.
Fast, catalytic and risk-tolerant funding is crucial for sustaining peace. The Peacebuilding Fund maintained its support levels with the renewed commitment of 33 Member States at its pledging conference in September 2016. The Fund exceeded the United Nations-wide target to allocate at least 15 per cent to gender equality and women’s empowerment. It also expanded its role in financing cross-border and regional peacebuilding initiatives, launched the first United Nations dedicated funding stream on youth, peace and security, and for the first time directly funded civil society organizations.
8. Partnerships
We stand a better chance of success if we join together to address potential crises and support communities in the pursuit of peace. I have, therefore, prioritized partnerships and signed an agreement in April 2017 with the Chairperson of the African Commission, formalizing joint mechanisms for regular consultation and cooperation at the strategic and working levels. The agreement covers the gamut of peace and security, from the establishment of a United Nations-African Union working group on conflict prevention to crisis management. In Somalia, Darfur, the Central African Republic and Mali, our cooperation with the African Union showcases a history of innovative and adapted solutions. I hope that my proposals on sustainable, predictable and flexible financing for African Union peace support operations mandated by the Council will receive favourable consideration by Member States. Such collaboration must be based on an understanding of comparative advantage and added value.
Our partnerships are among the most valuable preventive tools of
the United Nations
Effective partnerships are among the most valuable preventive tools available to the United Nations, whether with Governments, non-governmental organizations or the private sector. In Central Asia, we are working closely with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on a range of issues, including addressing the threats of terrorism, violent extremism and drug trafficking. In Southern Africa, the United Nations supported national mediation training conducted by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Lesotho ahead of the June 2017 elections, as a contribution to the broader SADC mediation effort. In Southeast Asia, the United Nations concluded a new plan of action with the Association of South-East Asian Nations, emphasizing a closer partnership for sustaining peace and preventive diplomacy and in economic and sociocultural affairs. In Europe, I am committed to supporting a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine through the efforts of the Normandy Four, the Trilateral Contact Group and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Our close cooperation with the European Union was further strengthened, particularly in Mali, the Central African Republic and Somalia, and we have worked together in key political processes across Africa and the Middle East. We have also focused on rapid deployment and security sector reform.
In April 2017, the World Bank President and I signed an updated Partnership Framework for Crisis and Post-Crisis Situations, expanding the partnership to include collaboration in preventing violent conflict. We renewed our commitment to work together on development, humanitarian, political, security, peacebuilding and human rights challenges.
To prevent conflict and sustain peace, we must assist countries in attaining the
Sustainable Development Goals
To prevent conflict and sustain peace, we must assist countries in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet the link between inclusive sustainable development and the prevention of violence is not well understood. A joint United Nations-World Bank flagship study on how development and political processes interact for the prevention of violence, the first of its kind, is under way and will examine the evidence on how grievances linked to inequality and exclusion increase the risk of violent conflict.
C. Development of Africa
One of my highest priorities is to strengthen United Nations efforts in Africa. To reinforce this commitment, my first trip as Secretary-General was to attend the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa in January, where I met with the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat. In April, I convened in New York the first United Nations-African Union Annual Conference, where we pledged to strengthen and deepen cooperation and underscored the importance of the strategic partnership between the two organizations in efforts to promote sustainable development, peace and security and human rights on the continent.
Africa today, like other parts of the world, presents a dynamic yet contradictory picture of progress and challenges. On the one hand, economic growth in several African countries surpassed that in other parts of the globe, and the data encouragingly show that enrolment in primary education in sub-Saharan Africa improved dramatically from 52 per cent in 1990 to 80 per cent in 2015, while the reduction in child mortality rates has also been significant. Yet some parts of Africa face threats and challenges involving protracted violence and human insecurity that undermine development. Continued conflict has meant that three of the four countries currently facing severe threats of famine are located in Africa.
Economically, the continent remains highly commodity dependent, while, as a result of the volatility in global commodity prices, unstable export income in many African countries has significantly affected economic growth patterns. Future challenges also confront the continent. Projected population growth estimates show Africa as the fastest-growing region of the world (see figure IV), with a growing youth population that will reach about 60 per cent of the total population by 2050 (see figure V). These young people require education, jobs, housing and health care, thereby putting pressure on Governments to deliver.
Figure IV

Figure V

The continent can take advantage of this demographic dividend by investing in quality education, teacher training, technology and innovation, which would boost productivity, create jobs and promote inclusive growth and prosperity. Scaling up investments and strengthening the ability of institutions to deliver innovative solutions will involve multilateral partnerships, which the United Nations can facilitate. Providing opportunities and empowering women and youth as a development goal will be essential.
The 2030 Agenda is key to Africa’s future, and the United Nations is working closely with its partners in Africa towards a mutually reinforcing implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, in harmony with the African Union’s Agenda 2063. To promote these synergies, the United Nations and the African Union have together adopted a common reporting architecture with a single monitoring and evaluation framework. Furthermore, in December 2016 the General Assembly adopted the Framework for a Renewed United Nations-African Union Partnership on Africa’s Integration and Development Agenda 2017-2027 (resolution 71/254). These dynamics require a concentrated effort, and it is in the interest of every country in the world to focus on preparing a strong future for Africa.
D. Promotion and protection of all human rights
Peace is itself a human rights imperative
I am convinced, more than ever, that peace is itself a human rights imperative. Across our world, numerous crises and conflicts have erupted, involving repeated violations of the laws that protect people’s human rights even in times of public emergency and war. Medical facilities, religious sites and schools were repeatedly attacked and bombed in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen. In these and other crisis areas — such as Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Lake Chad region which has suffered the attacks of Boko Haram, Mali, parts of Myanmar, Somalia, the Sudan, Ukraine and the Occupied Palestinian Territory — hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives.
Survivors have been increasingly compelled to flee, becoming exposed to heightened risk of death or further violation as they move in conditions that fail to respect human dignity, leaving children hungry, unschooled and subject to violence. Stopping these crimes against peace and ensuring redress for victims and accountability for perpetrators must be among our most urgent tasks.
Alongside bloody conflict, the past year has seen the continued deprivation of basic economic and social rights for millions of women, men and children owing to chronic poverty for some and weak governance or imposed austerity for many others. Massive inequality among genders, social groups and income levels has strained public confidence. All too often, economic and social insecurities are being blamed on “the other” — whether migrants or other racial, ethnic, gender or social groups — rather than on failures of public policy.
In this context, millions have sought refuge from armed conflict and have migrated in search of opportunities and the protection of their human rights. The death toll from attempted migration across the Mediterranean Sea has been despairingly high, with some 1,900 dead or missing by July 2017, despite fewer overall arrivals in Europe compared with 2015/16. Countless more lost their lives or went missing in other regions of the world, and suffered torture, trauma and other human rights abuses en route.
I have been distressed to see the malevolence of political discourse in many countries. Instead of taking a reasoned and cooperative approach, many leaders have fanned the growing flames of prejudice and fear which divide and weaken their societies. A wave of racism and xenophobia has swept the globe, manifest in stereotyping, racial profiling, hate speech and hate crimes. Perhaps more than ever before, the universal norms and mechanisms of human rights need our united support.
In a moment of hope for the future, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (see para. 52 above) took a strong, principled stand, with Member States committing to protect the human rights of all migrants regardless of their migratory status at all times and taking into account the specific needs of those in vulnerable situations. The Organization is supporting States in this endeavour, but greater and more consistent leadership is needed across every region.
Human rights are at the core of my call for prevention and sustaining peace
Human rights measures are the lifeblood of any effort to prevent conflict and sustain peace. They are investments which bring both immediate and long-term benefits in building resilience, redressing grievances, reducing inequality and advancing sustainable development.
This is why, in the past year, we have deployed rapid and multidisciplinary “light teams” to situations of concern in Burkina Faso, Lesotho and the Congo. The Human Rights Council established three commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions during the reporting period, on South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Burundi, respectively, as well as a group of independent experts on accountability for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also deployed nine other inquiries, including on Yemen and Myanmar.
These missions conduct on-the-ground investigations and deliver fact-based impartial assessments, giving voice to the victims and drawing attention to situations of urgent global concern. Their findings and targeted recommendations lay the foundation to hold States, non-State actors and individuals accountable. Field officers also monitor and investigate allegations to prompt States to fulfil their human rights obligations, thus preventing future violations. Working with media is also essential. Most recently, during the siege and bombardment of eastern Aleppo in the Syrian Arab Republic and during hostilities in Burundi, strong, well-informed public statements helped to generate media coverage, which helped to mitigate some serious abuses and violations.
A backlash against the advancement of women’s rights has fuelled rollbacks of legislation relating to gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive rights. We must move with all deliberate speed towards greater equality, especially in terms of violence against women, conflict-related sexual abuse, trafficking and related exploitation and the pervasive discrimination that deprives millions of women of education, economic resources and reproductive rights. There must be stronger action against the recruitment and use of girls in armed conflict, including their sexual enslavement and use as suicide bombers. During the reporting period, we continued to assist countries to improve laws relating to the human rights of women and girls and agreed on frameworks for action to prevent and respond to conflict-related sexual violence and ensure accountability.
I am concerned about crackdowns abridging fundamental public freedoms — freedom of expression, opinion and peaceful assembly. The full participation of civil society is essential to making progress across all United Nations goals. Clearly, when Governments and their proxies clamp down against activists, lawyers, human rights defenders, journalists and political opponents — or scrap the guarantees of an independent judiciary — they are not acting to halt violence but are instead discrediting their own States and the trust of their own people. Denial of expression undercuts State opportunities for international cooperation and capacities to respond to real security threats and development challenges.
Alarmed by acts of intimidation and reprisals against people who engage with the United Nations on human rights issues, I have taken action to strengthen the United Nations response to such incidents. Civil society participation is essential to the work of the United Nations and that of all of our partners. My concerns have deepened over the past year regarding attacks against human rights defenders, including several individuals engaged in defending persecuted populations, indigenous peoples, minorities, women’s rights, land rights and the environment. Across the globe, peaceful human rights defenders and those acting in solidarity with them have been met with growing persecution.
The Human Rights Council’s universal periodic review process is now entering a new cycle, with every Member State scheduled for a third round of scrutiny. We will work to strengthen the relevance, precision and impact of the Council’s recommendations, including by providing better support to Member States in implementation, stronger collaboration with United Nations country teams and the establishment of national mechanisms for human rights reporting and follow-up to link the universal periodic review to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. My Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict reports annually to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly on grave crimes against children, bringing to light the dire situations these children face.
Ultimately, the 2030 Agenda offers a road map towards a more rights-respecting world. A strong focus on human rights, equality and the empowerment of women has been integrated into the revised United Nations Development Framework guidelines, while the entire United Nations system is now committed to integrating the imperative of eliminating discrimination and reducing inequalities, leaving no one behind.
E. Effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts
During 2017, the United Nations and its humanitarian partners assisted more people than any previous year since the founding of the Organization. A total of 96.2 million people, more than half of them women and children, were targeted for life-saving assistance of food, shelter, health and protection in over 40 countries.
Devastating natural disasters now displace three times more people than conflicts
Yet devastating natural disasters, such as floods, storms, wildfires and severe weather, now displace three times more people than are displaced by conflicts.
More than 31 million new cases of internal displacement were recorded in 2016, the equivalent of one person forced to flee every second. Of these, more than 24.2 million people were displaced by natural hazards in 118 countries and territories, or more than three times the 6.9 million people who were recently displaced as a result of conflict. The frequency, intensity and cost of natural disasters have increased owing to changing weather patterns. The 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon prompted 23 countries across four continents to seek assistance for more than 60 million people, and there may be a new El Niño episode in 2017.
An unprecedented food crisis has hit more people than ever before. Conflict, drought and violence have carried the threat of famine that has affected 20 million people in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.
Nevertheless, disregard for international humanitarian law and human rights law remained endemic, as evidenced by attacks against civilians, humanitarian workers and medical personnel.
To address these needs, in 2017 the United Nations appealed for a record level of $22.5 billion in humanitarian support (see figure VI). Yet despite the generosity of donors, who provided $12.6 billion in 2016, humanitarian action remained challenged by a lack of funds and access on the ground. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs administered some $714 million in country-based pool funds to relieve 17 crises, along with $439 million from the Central Emergency Response Funds to support 47 countries through rapid-response and underfunded emergency grants in 2016.

In response to the unprecedented levels of humanitarian needs, the first ever World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 set out to reduce suffering. The Summit was evidence that the need for principled humanitarian action to better deliver to affected people is more crucial today than ever before (see figure VII).

F. Promotion of justice and international law
The United Nations is increasingly involved in promoting justice and the rule of law in international courts, treaties and agreements and in providing support to domestic authorities. While human rights are discussed separately in section D above, respect for justice and the rule of law are an integral part of human rights. Deprived of peaceful, legal redress, the lack of justice and the rule of law, some segments of society may be drawn to violence. Thus, the role of the United Nations in promoting human rights becomes even more necessary.
1. Support for domestic authorities
A fully national Special Criminal Court has been established in
the Central African Republic
In a major contribution to sustainable peace, a fully national Special Criminal Court has been established in the Central African Republic, with comprehensive support from the United Nations. The United Nations will continue to contribute to the Court, which is unique in its structure and national foundation. The Court is created as a national court which includes both international and national officials, formulated to address more than a decade of serious crimes in the country.
In its efforts to support the rule of law and respond to the horrific refugee crisis emanating from the explosively escalating conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Nations has been assisting in the protection of the human rights of those fleeing to neighbouring countries, mainly in Lebanon and Jordan. Also in support of national efforts in Colombia, I have designated a member of the selection mechanism of judges and other officials of the justice component of the final peace agreement. Furthermore, the United Nations is delivering critical support to 19 countries in 2017 through the Global Focal Point for Police, Justice and Corrections in crisis situations (see figure VIII).
Figure VIII
“One United Nations” approach to police, justice and corrections and the broader rule of law
Increasingly aware of sexual violence and abuse, the United Nations has helped national authorities build their capacity to respond effectively. This assistance includes capacity-building for criminal investigations, prosecutions, military justice, legislative reform, protection of victims and witnesses and reparations. In Guinea, following the provision by the United Nations of support to a national panel of judges, 17 high-ranking military and political officials, including former President Camara, were indicted. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, United Nations support contributed to the conviction of 100 members of the State security forces.
In 2017, the United Nations launched a flagship initiative on women’s access to justice. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the United Nations produced materials for a training course for judicial officers on human rights and violence against women, while in Egypt some 1,000 women benefited from free legal services.
2. International courts and mechanisms
The International Court of Justice, one of the six main bodies of the United Nations, continues to function as a central mechanism for the peaceful resolution of disputes and maintains a high level of judicial activity (www.icj-cij.org). Acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction among Member States is one of my highest priorities.
The International Criminal Court contributes to the international justice system by holding people accountable for heinous crimes. In an important contribution to international criminal law, it found Ahmed Al Faqi Al Mahdi guilty of attacks on cultural property and historic monuments as a war crime. In 2017, the Court also convicted Jean-Pierre Bemba, former Vice-President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in its first case on offences against the administration of justice.
In the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, the Supreme Court Chamber upheld the conviction of two senior Khmer Rouge officials, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, for crimes against humanity (www.eccc.gov.kh).
In an unprecedented step, the General Assembly established the International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. Equally unprecedented, the United Nations has provided technical assistance to the African Union Commission for the establishment of a hybrid court in South Sudan.
3. Promotion of international law
The International Law Commission completed its work on a proposed treaty for the protection of persons in the event of disasters and made significant progress on a possible new treaty on crimes against humanity. To protect the world’s oceans, the Ocean Conference was held at United Nations Headquarters in June 2017. Member States also worked towards an international legally binding instrument within the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to protect marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Flagged as a major success, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer that will reduce emissions of powerful greenhouse gases was adopted by 197 countries in October 2016.
G. Disarmament
Disarmament and arms control have played an intrinsic role in easing international tensions and maintaining peace and security, and the Organization’s advocacy for disarmament is more vital than ever.
Conventional arms are the predominant means of killing and destruction
While we rightly fear the use of weapons of mass destruction, conventional arms are the predominant means of killing and destruction. The Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects remains the leading instrument for facilitating cooperation between States to prevent the diversion and proliferation of these weapons. As an example of collective action, in April 2017, after nearly two decades of inaction, the Disarmament Commission adopted recommendations on practical confidence-building measures in the field of conventional weapons.
Through its regional centres for peace and disarmament, the United Nations continues to build the capacity of States to tackle illicit arms trade through practical measures, such as stockpile management and legal assistance. Since February 2017, the regional centre in Latin America and the Caribbean has provided technical and logistical planning assistance for the laying down of arms in Colombia, including methods and techniques for their deactivation.
The past months show increased use of weapons against civilian populations
An upsurge in the use of weapons against civilian populations includes horrific reports of chemical weapon attacks. Through the Joint Investigative Mechanism, the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons were able to reach conclusions on four of the chemical attacks. I welcome the Security Council decision to renew the mandate of the Mechanism and fully support the continuation of its impartial, independent and professional work.
Negotiations on a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons were held at Headquarters in July 2017, with my full support, as a step towards the universally desired goal of a nuclear weapon-free world. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, adopted on 7 July 2017 (see A/CONF.229/2017/8), will be open for signature by States on 20 September and must be ratified by at least 50 countries before it can enter into force. The Treaty requires its parties to maintain their safeguard arrangements with the International Atomic Energy Agency or to accept Agency safeguards if they have not already done so.
The growing tensions over nuclear testing and ballistic missile activities undertaken by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea undermine global and regional security and underscore the need for a robust international disarmament and non-proliferation regime. I welcome the united commitment to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as preparations begin for the 2020 Review Conference of Parties to the Treaty.
The United Nations now faces the additional challenges of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and the potential harmful use of outer space. In an age of technical revolution, it is vital that the international community stay ahead of the curve to ensure that technology is not used for malicious purposes.
H. Drug control, crime prevention and combating international terrorism
The globalized movement of people and trade in goods, both legal and illegal, continues to expand faster than the international community can track, let alone regulate. The large movement of refugees and migrants, often triggered by conflict, has exposed more people to trafficking, with the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2016 showing an alarmingly high proportion of children among the victims. Smuggled wildlife and antiquities are also caught up in this nightmare. Drawing on the first global database of seizures, the World Wildlife Crime Report: Trafficking in Protected Species, 2016 documented the trafficking of almost 7,000 wildlife species. In addition, technological advances are exploited for criminal purposes and cybercrime remains a global challenge. The United Nations is also addressing crime issues through the development of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration and a global compact for refugees (see para. 52 above).
1. Drug control
The world drug problem remains a looming concern. According to the World Drug Report 2017, 29.5 million people suffer from drug use disorders, and markets are characterized by the fast-evolving nature of abused substances. Drug users are often trapped in a cycle of marginalization, making their recovery and social integration difficult.
The United Nations continues to support human rights-based drug policies and capacity-building in public health, criminal justice, prison administration and civil society in support of increased access to services, including HIV services, for people who use drugs and people in prisons. In the field of alternative development to replace drug crops, the United Nations supports rural communities by providing legitimate income-earning opportunities that focus on cash crops with sustainable markets.
At the special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem, held in 2016, Member States reaffirmed a comprehensive approach that places public health, development and human rights concerns alongside law enforcement concerns. Nations reaffirmed the centrality of the three international drug conventions and other relevant instruments. The outcome document (resolution S-30/1) includes more than 100 operational recommendations which countries are translating into action under the lead of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs.
2. Crime prevention
Two of my highest priorities are the elimination of all forms of violence
against women and against children
In line with United Nations support for Member States in responding to crime, two of my highest priorities are the elimination of all forms of violence against women and against children. Rape, as a war crime, is a frequent occurrence during times of violence. My Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict highlighted the use of sexual violence as a tactic of war and terrorism. This culminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution 2331 (2016) on human trafficking, in which the Council stresses the risk of trafficking in persons in conflict situations and recognizes the protection and empowerment of women and girls as a central consideration in counter-terrorism and obstructing violent extremist strategies. Children have also been targets of abuse, and killing and maiming remain the most frequent and horrific violations against children. For example, in Afghanistan, the United Nations verified 3,512 child casualties in 2016, a 24 per cent increase over 2015 and the highest level ever recorded. Thanks to advocacy by my Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, however, this year 110 children detained in Somalia were released by May. The United Nations must continue such efforts to eliminate this scourge.
Corruption has a deleterious effect on development because precious resources are siphoned off for personal gain. This year marked the beginning of the second implementation review cycle of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, which focuses on preventive measures and asset recovery.
3. Combating international terrorism
The General Assembly recently approved my proposal to create a new
Office of Counter-Terrorism
We are spearheading a new agenda for counter-terrorism through three strategic measures:
(a) The General Assembly recently approved my proposal to create a new Office of Counter-Terrorism headed by an Under-Secretary-General in order to provide stronger leadership and coherence across the United Nations system while strengthening the delivery to Member States of United Nations capacity-building for counter-terrorism. The new Office will improve visibility, advocacy and resource mobilization to broaden efforts to promote conflict prevention, build sustainable peace and address the root causes that enable terrorist recruitment;
(b) A reinvigorated “all United Nations” approach will continue to assist in the implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the international legal and normative framework, including a plan to stem the flow of terrorist fighters;
(c) The High-Level Preventing Violent Extremism Action Group will play a key role in the prevention of violent extremism.
Chapter III
Strengthening the Organization
Our efforts to implement the Organization’s ambitious reform agenda rest on ensuring that we simplify procedures, decentralize decision-making and move towards even greater transparency and accountability. The Organization requires systems, policies and procedures that bring decision-making closer to the point of delivery and empower senior management to deliver on their programmes. To bring about this paradigm shift, I have launched a set of action-based processes to strengthen the management of the Organization.
In April 2017, I established an internal review team on management reform under the overall guidance of the Chef de Cabinet. The team was requested:
(a) To identify internal measures that the Secretariat could take to streamline procedures, reduce delays and improve the implementation of mandates, some of which are already under way;
(b) To identify proposals that would support and advance the broader agenda to reform the Organization.
Consultations have been central to this reform track. During May and June, we held a series of informal brainstorming sessions with Member States and received feedback from departments, funds and programmes. In July, I held a retreat with Member States to present the initial ideas of the internal review team on management reform. The Secretariat will prepare my report on management reform for the consideration of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session.
The Umoja planning and operational system has been implemented to modernize the way in which the Secretariat globally manages the administration of business and information technology processes. Umoja has been slow to take root and it has been a challenge to remove its kinks, but Secretariat entities are increasingly leveraging the system’s capabilities to improve the efficiency of their operations. On environmental responsibility, the Secretariat is leading by example in helping the United Nations system “green” its operations by implementing environmental management systems.
The Organization requires systems, policies and procedures that bring
decision-making closer to the point of delivery and empower senior management
to deliver on their programmes
Smart technology alone is not enough, however. The Organization must develop and deploy its greatest asset — its human resources — in a more strategic manner. The aim of the staff selection and managed mobility system launched in January 2016 is to develop dynamic, adaptable and agile staff who can best deliver the mandates entrusted to them.
Because I believe that gender parity in the workplace is essential, I recently promulgated a comprehensive strategy to this end and plan to reach gender parity at the senior leadership level by 2021 and across the Organization soon thereafter. My special representatives are essential conflict managers in the field, and the United Nations has been steadily increasing the number of women special representatives and deputy special representatives (see figure IX).
Figure IX

The United Nations has wrestled with the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse. Every victim deserves justice and our full support. My report on special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (A/71/818) outlines four main areas of action: putting victims first; ending impunity; engaging civil society and external partners; and improving strategic communications for education and transparency. To this end, I have created the position of Victims Rights Advocate at the Assistant Secretary-General level.
The United Nations must uphold its ethical standards. Therefore, I have strengthened the whistle-blower protection policy that allows the Ethics Office and the Office of Internal Oversight Services to take preventive action where a risk of retaliation against those reporting violations has been identified. Staff now also have the right to seek a review of Ethics Office determinations. The revised policy is based on elements deemed to be international best practice. I have asked an internal working group to consider additional areas for improvement and I intend to consult staff and management in coming months. Additional strengthening of United Nations ethical standards includes the establishment of the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework, which fosters a culture of integrity and honesty and informs staff about the ways in which the Secretariat prevents, detects, responds to and reports on fraud and corruption.
Transforming the Organization to better deliver on its mandate is our ultimate goal. This means strengthening and integrating our management team, our methods of analysis and our early warning and delivery systems. It also means improving the quality of leadership at Headquarters and in the field and building the confidence of Member States.
Chapter IV
Conclusion
The present report provides a snapshot of the work of the Organization in a world steeped in contradictory and complex challenges. Millions have been lifted out of poverty yet millions of others face the threat of famine. Globalization has brought prosperity to many yet others have been cruelly left behind, excluded and caught in a system of inequality and rising xenophobia. The world has witnessed the massive migration of people fleeing violent conflict on a scale not seen since the Second World War and the undeniable megatrend of climate change and its multiplier effects demand global action, yet multilateralism is being questioned at a time when we most need coherent global responses to these interconnected events. No nation acting alone can resolve these crises. The United Nations is the gravitational centre for dialogue and cooperation to find common solutions, and with its concentrated support Member States have reached two landmark agreements: the 2030 Agenda and the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Taken together, they demonstrate that nations have the will to work multilaterally when they see a driving need. They represent a clear road map to a mutual destination: taking care of our shared global home.
The United Nations must be up to the challenge. I have laid out a number of reform proposals to make the Organization more effective, flexible and nimble, with a renewed culture of prevention permeating all our work. Ultimately, future generations will judge the United Nations by our ability to make our norms and aspirations a reality, particularly for those who suffer the most. The onus falls on the United Nations to prove its worth.

Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization
As we approach the seventy-fifth anniversary of the
United Nations, the world’s leading instrument of shared
progress, our common purposes and principles remain as
important as ever. The Organization, and its ethos of
international cooperation, have yielded great and
wide-ranging benefits to humankind, lifting millions out
of poverty, upholding human rights and helping to forge
peace in troubled lands. In today’s rapidly changing world,
our enduring and Charter-driven duty is to build on those
achievements and ensure that all people can enjoy safety,
prosperity and dignity. In that spirit, I offer my third report
on the work of the Organization concerned about the
state of our world – but also encouraged by what I know
we can deliver for the people we serve.
CHALLENGES THAT
TRANSCEND BORDERS
The world continues to face grave global challenges that
no single Member State or organization can address
alone. The existential threat posed by climate change is
paramount among those perils. Climate change-related
disasters affect an average of 350 million people every
year, and every day global warming is reversing hard-won
development gains and exacerbating poverty. Biodiversity
is being lost at an alarming rate.
Those factors, among others,
have contributed to increasing
levels of displacement, which
expose vulnerable populations
on the move to human rights
violations and create complex
challenges in transit and destination countries. As these and
other problems persist and
proliferate, we see growing
fear, uncertainty and frustration
undermining public trust in
institutions and political establishments and providing a
breeding ground for hate speech,
xenophobia and other divisive
and dangerous narratives.

INTRODUCTION
Global challenges
require global
solutions. It is not
enough to proclaim
the virtue of
multilateralism;
we must prove its
added value.”
António Guterres, Secretary-General
My profound concern about
this alarming trajectory – including hate-driven violence and atrocious attacks on
places of worship – led me to launch a strategy to combat
hate speech and to explore how the United Nations can
support the protection of holy sites around the world.
In 2019, nearly 142 million people will need humanitarian
assistance. Armed conflicts and violence continue to
destroy lives and communities. Conflicts have become more
complex and interlinked. Violent extremism and terrorism
continue to destabilize countries and entire regions.
Pervasive poverty and rising inequality across and especially within countries are of significant concern, as are
the worrying trends of shrinking democratic and civic
space, often affecting human rights defenders, health
workers and journalists first. Violence against women and
girls and renewed pushback against women’s rights and
gender equality remain pervasive across the world.

the temperature rise to 1.5°C
and to meet other climate targets
for 2020 and beyond.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, encapsulated in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, continues
to provide a clear and universal road map for building a
fair globalization and transforming economies and societies to ensure that no one is left behind. Much progress
has been achieved. Yet, at the current pace, we will not
reach our targets. We need to bring much greater urgency
and ambition to this work, through enhanced international cooperation, private-public partnerships, adequate
financing and innovative solutions. We also need to empower young people as partners and leaders, as envisaged
in Youth 2030: The United Nations Strategy on Youth.
In December 2018, the agreement by Member States on
a landmark Global Compact
for Safe, Orderly and Regular
Migration provided a voluntary
platform for countries of origin,
transit and destination to maximize the benefits of migration
and tackle its associated challenges. Along with the global
compact on refugees, affirmed
that same month, the world
now has far-reaching pathways to ensure that human
mobility works for all.
Despite hurdles, the climate change conference held in
Katowice, Poland, in December agreed on a work programme
to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate
change, a notable step forward. The climate summit to
be held in September 2019 will be an opportunity to
accelerate the global response towards the goal of limiting

police-contributing countries,
Security Council members and
host countries. Since the launch
of this effort in March 2018,
more than 150 Member States
and 4 international and regional organizations have endorsed
the Declaration of Shared
Commitments on United Nations
Peacekeeping Operations.
We have conducted independent reviews of our operations
to assess how we can better
deliver on our mandates, and
have prioritized efforts to increase the number of female
uniformed personnel. We are
also promoting women’s meaningful inclusion in peace
processes, given that experience shows that this produces
more robust and sustainable
agreements.
Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization
I have proposed a new disarmament agenda to address
weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons
and to ensure that wondrous new technologies do not
spark a horrendous new arms race. Our aim is threefold:
disarmament to save humanity, disarmament to save lives
and disarmament to safeguard our future.
While the United Nations continues to provide life-saving
humanitarian assistance and strengthen peace operations,
we are all keenly aware that ending wars and violence is
the only real and long-term solution to the destruction
and human suffering they cause. This is why, since taking
office, I have placed an emphasis on prevention, mediation
and a surge in peacemaking and diplomacy.
Recent months have seen progress in addressing volatile
situations, resolving conflicts and restoring hope to those
affected by years of war, violence and instability, for
example by ensuring peaceful and democratic elections
in Madagascar. In February 2019, Greece and North
Macedonia settled their long-standing “name” dispute,
showing that even seemingly intractable issues can
be resolved through dialogue and political will. Close
cooperation with regional organizations has been essential.

At the same time, we are committed to a collective
system-wide approach to addressing such challenges as
the outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, which continues to unfold in a challenging
environment marked by conflict and insecurity. I urge
Member States and partner organizations to ensure that
the responding agencies have the resources they need
to succeed.
UNITING FOR REFORM
To meet current and emerging
global challenges, we have
embarked on major reforms
of the Organization. We
have transformed the United
Nations development system
and rolled out a new generation of country teams and
resident coordinators. We have
strengthened and streamlined
our peace and security architecture to better integrate
prevention, peacemaking,
peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We have created
new management structures
at Headquarters to provide
Susan Hopper
However, in the face of complex conflicts, this work is
difficult and requires patience and persistence, as we have
seen in the Central African Republic, South Sudan and
the Syrian Arab Republic. In Yemen, the United Nationsbrokered Stockholm Agreement, reached in December
2018, represented welcome progress, although there are
still many obstacles, and more needs to be done to ensure
that the parties live up to their commitments and that a
true political process finally leads to peace. Across these
and other situations, I continue to offer my good offices
and personal engagement wherever they can add value,
alongside my envoys and special representatives, drawing
on the experience of the United Nations and those in the
broader mediation community.
Ultimately, the
success of our work
is measured by the
results we achieve
for the people
we serve.”

better policy advice and operational support to the rest of the
Secretariat, in particular in the
field. We have decentralized
decision-making authority to
ensure that managers have the
means at their disposal to deliver their programmes, while
at the same time being held
accountable for the use of their
resources and the performance
of their entities. We have
adopted new management
practices and developed new
capacities.
Reform is ultimately about ensuring that we are best positioned
to serve people – people suffering in poverty or exclusion,
victimized by conflict, those whose rights and dignity are
being denied, and so many millions with ideas and dreams
who need a helping hand.
To fulfil our mandates more efficiently and effectively, our
actions must be rooted in transparency, coordination and
accountability. We must break silos and bring the pillars
of our work together so that efforts to advance peace,
sustainable development and human rights are mutually reinforcing.
We also continue to make significant progress towards
gender parity: for the first time in the Organization’s history, we have achieved parity in the Senior Management

ADDRESSING A
FINANCIAL CRISIS
Success in reform also rests on sufficient and predictable
financial contributions from Member States. Yet regular
budget operations financed from assessed contributions
face severe cash shortfalls and deficits that are happening
earlier, going deeper and lasting longer. In addition,
structural weaknesses in the budget methodology can
cause expenditures to outpace the approved budget
level and the collection of assessed contributions. The
peacekeeping budget faces similar problems. More than
one third of our peacekeeping missions do not have cash
resources to cover their costs, which creates delays in

at parity among the senior leadership ranks across the
Organization, well ahead of my target date of 2021. This
is not just an exercise in numbers; it is about creating an
inclusive workforce. With respect to sexual harassment,
exploitation and abuse, our focus remains on prevention,
responding rapidly to allegations, supporting victims
through their trauma and ensuring accountability.
Towards that end, we have established a helpline for staff,
strengthened our investigative capacity and established
a screening database to prevent perpetrators from moving
undetected from one part of the United Nations system
to another. Those three challenges together – achieving
gender parity, preventing sexual harassment and preventing
sexual exploitation and abuse – are critical to my overall
reform initiatives and for taking the Organization forward.

making payments to troop- and police-contributing countries. I have done everything within my power to persuade
Governments to pay assessed contributions on time, and
I thank those – the vast majority – that have done so. But
we are still nowhere near where we need to be. We are
at a tipping point, and what we do next will matter for
years to come. That is why I put forward a set of concrete,
common-sense proposals to squarely address the
deteriorating and unsustainable financial situation. The
proposals were aimed at preventing any disruption to
our activities and ensuring that our work is guided by
prioritized mandates.
We are at a defining

I appreciate the General
Assembly’s positive response in
July to some of the proposals.
Those actions will not entirely
solve the problem, but will at
least enable us to reimburse
troop- and police-contributing
countries in a more timely manner. Unfortunately, we have not
yet resolved the crisis facing
our regular budget operations,
which, if left unaddressed,
will undermine our ability to
implement mandates and the
approved programme of work.
I urge Governments to find
common ground to address this
crisis and put the Organization
on a solid financial footing.

HARNESSING NEW
TECHNOLOGIES
Transformational technologies and scientific advances will
continue to bring change at a rapid pace, outstripping
the capacity of Governments and multilateral institutions
to respond appropriately. Strong international cooperation, as well as inclusive processes open to all relevant
stakeholders, are critical if we want to grasp the opportunities created by new technologies to reduce poverty,
reverse climate change, fight hate speech, expand opportunities for young people and address other pressing
global challenges. The debate initiated by the report of
the independent High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation
will continue in the coming months. The United Nations
stands ready to serve as a platform for a discussion of
how these new technologies can serve as a force for good
and help to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

such as those in Mozambique and the Caribbean – places
that have done little to contribute to the climate crisis yet
are often its first victims.
I have had countless memorable encounters in the first
half of my mandate, and witnessed and heard vivid
testimony from people who are counting on us to deliver
– from families in the Pacific fearing the inundation of
their countries by rising seas, to Rohingya refugees seeking
their rights, to civil society activists in communities and
conference rooms mobilizing behind our shared work.
Across these diverse circumstances and many more, I have
seen a common thread: a deep conviction by people all
over the world that the United Nations must live up to its
ideals. I take that duty to heart and am strongly committed to pushing Member States to do their part while I do
mine – to build an effective and responsive agent of
progress for all.
I have visited the Central African Republic and mourned
fallen peacekeepers in Bangassou who gave everything
for the cause of peace; met with courageous human rights
defenders in Colombia and elsewhere; been inspired by
the passion of young students for education in schools
run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees in the Near East; journeyed to central
Mali and heard the profound determination of local leaders
to fight for peace and reconciliation; and travelled to the
front lines of the world’s climate emergency and seen the
devastation resulting from extreme weather disasters,
There is no other way to address global challenges but to
act collectively. But in today’s difficult context, it is not
enough to proclaim the virtue of multilateralism; we must
prove its added value. On the eve of the Organization’s
seventy-fifth anniversary, the Charter of the United
Nations points the way, with its hope for a future in which
people and countries live together as good neighbours,
defending universal values and shaping our common
future. Commitment to this vision is needed now more
than ever.

Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization
PROMOTION OF SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
ALIGNMENT WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
As the world faces mounting challenges, including
protracted conflicts, inequality, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger and a fast-changing climate, international
cooperation is essential if no one is to be left behind. The
work of the United Nations is focused increasingly on
prevention and on taking an integrated approach to
development, peace and security and human rights. The
United Nations system continues to support the efforts of
Member States to implement transformative agendas and
fulfil the promises made under the Sustainable Development
Goals, including by addressing cross-sectoral and crossborder issues and leveraging innovative multi-stakeholder
partnerships.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents
a blueprint for action for Member States and all stakeholders in areas of critical importance for humanity. Significant
progress has been made. Extreme poverty and maternal
and child mortality rates continue to fall, and the prevalence
of HIV has been reduced. Several countries have made
significant gains in advancing women’s political representation and have continued to strengthen laws and
policies to address discrimination. Millions more people in
the poorest countries have access to electricity. Globally,
labour productivity has increased, and unemployment is
back to pre-financial crisis levels.
But much more remains to be done. While global poverty
rates have decreased by more than half since 2000, more
than 731 million people – 10 per cent of the world’s
population – still live in extreme poverty and struggle to
meet their most essential needs, such as health care,
education, water and sanitation. The population of the
working poor has increased, with the precariousness of
their condition leaving them vulnerable to shocks. Global
unemployment levels have dropped since 2015, yet wage
growth has stagnated. Some 30 per cent of young women
and 13 per cent of young men are not in education,
employment or training. Alarmingly, in 2018, world hunger
rose after a prolonged decline. No country has yet achieved
gender equality.
Today, 55 per cent of the world’s
population lives in urban areas,
a proportion that is expected to
increase to 68 per cent by 2050.1

tsunamis and volcanos took
thousands of lives, and millions
more people were displaced
by floods, droughts and storms. People living in extreme
poverty are often those who are the most exposed to climate
shocks and the least able to manage them. Without drastic
action to reduce risk today, global warming will lead to
unprecedented economic and social destabilization.
Addressing poverty, vulnerability and inequality under the
framework of the 2030 Agenda contributes to reducing
human suffering and sustaining peace. In countries where
conflict has resulted in dire humanitarian and human rights
situations, sustaining peace depends on sustainable development but, equally, progress in achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals requires lasting peace.

Through multilateral efforts, a “rulebook” on how to
implement the Paris Agreement was adopted at the twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in
December 2018 in Katowice, Poland, accompanied by
initiatives from the private sector and local governments
and actors. The Paris Agreement is aimed at maintaining
the average global temperature rise to well below 2°C in
this century and limiting the rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
Supported by the Climate Change secretariat, the rulebook, known as the Katowice climate package, establishes
how Member States will provide information on their
nationally determined contributions, including how they
will measure, report and verify their emissions reductions.
One of the key components is a detailed transparency
framework to promote trust
among nations on their
actions to address climate
change.
In 2018, the United Nations
also introduced the online
Sendai Framework monitor,
which allows Member States
to track progress towards
achieving the Sendai Framework targets for disaster risk
reduction. The entire United
Nations system is supporting
many countries in the development of disaster risk reduction strategies in alignment
with their climate change
adaptation plans.

Scaling up financing for development

In 2018, the United Nations continued to help advance
progress on financing for the sustainable development
agenda (see E/FFDF/2018/3). Facilitated by the Organization,
the 2018 Development Coope-ration Forum produced
concrete policy guidance on the strategic role of development cooperation in achieving the goals of the 2030
Agenda. Drawing on recommendations set out in the
report entitled Financing for Development: Progress and
Prospects 2018,2 the United Nations also participated in
designing an agenda for global action.
In addition, the Secretary-General launched his Strategy
for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, in which he sets out actions to better align
global economic policies and financial systems and to
enhance sustainable financing strategies at the regional
and national levels. Looking ahead, the United Nations
will help build consensus on
defining sustainable investing
and measuring its impact.
The scale of the
Agenda

cooperation and
partnerships, which
are at the centre

In 2018, the United Nations
provided support to small island
developing States in preparing
a high-level midterm review
of the SAMOA Pathway, to
be convened by the General
Assembly in September 2019.
The Organization also advised
small island developing States
on how to meet their obligations under the Paris Agreement,
including by designing strategies for lowering greenhouse
gas emissions, building capacity for adaptation, gaining
access to finance and enhancing resilience.
Assessing trends and harnessing data
To strengthen the science-policy interface, the United
Nations began to work in 2018 with an independent
group of scientists that will prepare the first global
sustainable development report. The report, to be launched
at the high-level political forum on sustainable development
in September 2019, will provide an analysis of progress
towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals
and identify key areas in which policy interventions can
set the world on a more sustainable path.
In response to the unprecedented change brought about
by digital technologies and their potential impact on the
Agenda, the Secretary-General convened a Highlevel Panel on Digital Cooperation in 2018. The Panel’s
report4 includes pragmatic proposals on how to strengthen cooperation in the digital space. Stronger global
cooperation will be critical in realizing the full potential
of digital technologies, mitigating risks and curtailing unintended consequences.
In addition, the Organization advanced a broad range of
technology initiatives related to sustainable development.
This included facilitating the annual multi-stakeholder
forum on science, technology and innovation; the Access
to Space for All initiative; a public-private partnership on
the open data hub for the Sustainable Development
Goals; and collaborative data projects under the Global
Working Group on Big Data for Official Statistics.

More generally, poor governance and unequal access to
opportunity continued to fuel discontent in societies.
Hard-earned governance gains are put at risk and the
space for inclusive politics continues to shrink, creating
the potential for instability. Elections, if not inclusive and
peaceful, sometimes served as triggers for violence. While
technological progress brought about benefits, it also
created disruptions.
The year also marked the seventieth anniversary of United
Nations peacekeeping. The context in which peacekeeping operates today has changed dramatically since 1948.
Many locations in which the Security Council now mandates peacekeeping missions face protracted crises with
multiple adversaries, stalled peace processes, organized
crime and attacks from violent extremists or terrorists.

To successfully respond to such complex trends, the world
needs inclusive political processes, coordinated global
responses and effective multilateral institutions.
In the challenging environment of 2018, the global community also made progress. The rapprochement between
Eritrea and Ethiopia transformed political dynamics in the
Horn of Africa. The ceasefire agreement for Hudaydah
port gave new impetus to ending the crisis in Yemen. A
peace agreement brought renewed hope to South Sudan
and the Central African Republic. Iraq and its partners
completed operations against Islamic State in Iraq and the
Levant (ISIL). Many electoral processes, from Madagascar
to Maldives, resulted in peaceful transfers of power. The
agreement between Greece and North Macedonia reaffirmed optimism that protracted conflicts and disputes
can be resolved.
In support of multilateral action, Member States also
agreed to reform the Secretariat’s peace and security
pillar.5 And more than 150 States endorsed the Declaration
of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping
Operations as part of the Initiative on Action for
Peacekeeping.6 This multi-year initiative now constitutes

During 2018, challenging global trends underscored
the need for multilateral action to prevent conflict and to
keep and sustain peace. After decades of decline, the
resurgence of conflict continued. Wars, violence and
persecution uprooted nearly 71 million people. An increased
number of locations experienced violence, and the
number of conflict actors proliferated, with dire implications
for civilians. Conflicts were often regional and, despite
some progress, terrorism and violent extremism persisted.

MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY
KEY OBJECTIVES
KEY RESULTS
Based on the principles of the Charter of the United
Nations and the mandates of the Security Council and
General Assembly, the United Nations supports Member
States through major programmes on international peace
and security. Through its political affairs, peacebuilding
and peacekeeping programmes, the United Nations assists
in the prevention, management and peaceful resolution
of conflicts. Following recent reforms, those programmes
are now more closely integrated to deliver an effective
“whole-of-pillar” approach. In partnership with national
stakeholders, regional organizations and contributors, the
Organization also provides a range of other solutions to
help foster international peace and security.
Prevention, management and resolution
of conflicts
In several situations during the year, the United Nations
helped to prevent conflict or defuse tension. In
Madagascar, for example, it worked in coordination with
the African Union and other partners to help resolve
disagreements ahead of the presidential election. Collective
engagement contributed to the formation of a consensus
Government and a largely peaceful presidential election
and subsequent handover of power. In Somalia, the
United Nations and the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development worked to contain tensions between
Puntland and “Somaliland”. In Mali, United Nations good
offices – in collaboration with the African Union and the
Economic Community of West African States – were
instrumental in preventing escalation during the first
presidential election held since the signing of the 2015
peace agreement. To help resolve the protracted situation
in Western Sahara, the United Nations helped to
convene the first meeting of the parties in six years. In
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the stabilizing

In addition, the United Nations pursues dedicated programmes to tackle violence against children, address
sexual violence in conflict, protect children in armed
conflict and prevent sexual exploitation and abuse in
the Organization. It also maintains a programme on the
prevention of genocide.
AFRICAN UNION AND UNITED NATIONS
COOPERATION IN PEACE AND SECURITY
In December 2018, the African Union and the United
Nations signed a joint declaration outlining the guiding
principles for their cooperation in responding to conflict
and crisis situations in Africa, including collaboration
with African Union peace support operations. The
agreement is part of increasing collaboration between
the two organizations.

The United Nations helped to broker several other agreements to foster peace. In Yemen, United Nations-led talks
resulted in a ceasefire agreement for Hudaydah port,
which created hope for alleviating the world’s worst
humanitarian crisis. Following long-standing United
Nations mediation, Greece and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia signed a historic agreement to
resolve a dispute on the name of the latter country, which
is now known as North Macedonia. In the Central African
Republic, the leadership of the African Union and the
support of the United Nations mission were essential for
a peace agreement with armed groups. In South Sudan,
the peacekeeping mission provided critical support in the
conclusion of a revitalized peace agreement between the
parties. In the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Nations
continued to call for the implementation of the September
memorandum of understanding on Idlib to protect
civilians and facilitate a credible political process.
In all of those settings, the United Nations political presence on the ground has been instrumental in gaining
hard-won progress. The Organization deployed more than
special political missions, offices or envoys in countries

Protection of civilians
Peacebuilding support
Oscar Fernández-Taranco,
Assistant Secretary-General
for Peacebuilding Support
The protection of civilians is at
the heart of many United Nations
mandates. In 2018/19, eight peacekeeping missions had a
specific civilian protection task. To that end, civilian, military
and police personnel collaborated, based on integrated
strategies. In South Sudan, for example, they provided
physical protection to 190,000 women, children and men
at United Nations protection sites. Peacekeepers also
helped to establish protective environments for many people elsewhere, including through the provision of assistance
to authorities in Mali. In the eastern region of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, United Nations support
Following the adoption of two landmark resolutions in
2016, the United Nations has focused on better serving
nations in the goal of sustaining peace. In that context,
it assists the Peacebuilding Commission and manages the
Peacebuilding Fund to foster support for national efforts
and enhance system-wide partnerships, including with the
World Bank and other international financial institutions.

Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the
United Nations also continued to support national authorities in investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of
serious crimes. Across all field missions, more than 10,000
United Nations police officers helped to protect civilians,
prevent crime and build local policing capacity with community-oriented approaches.
Policy, evaluation and training
In the past year, the United Nations put significant effort
into policy development, evaluation and training. Since
late 2017, for example, the Organization completed eight
independent and externally led reviews of peacekeeping
missions. Those top-to-bottom reviews examined all
aspects of field operations and focused on ways to better
deliver on mandates. Together with the report of
Lieutenant General (Retired) Carlos Alberto dos Santos
Cruz, who was tasked with inspecting peacekeeping
fatalities and injuries due to violent acts, the reviews
helped to advance action. For example, United Nations
teams developed and piloted a comprehensive performance assessment system, which will be fully rolled out
by 2020.

ACTION FOR PEACEKEEPING (A4P)
In 2018, the Secretary-General launched the Action for
Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative. As a multi-year agenda
for better peacekeeping, it aims to spur stronger
collective action by all stakeholders, including Member
States, the Security Council, the General Assembly,
financial contributors, troop and police contributing
countries, host countries, intergovernmental and
regional organizations and the United Nations
Secretariat. Across 8 areas of action, the A4P declaration delivered 45 mutually-agreed commitments that
were endorsed by more than 150 Member States and
inter-governmental organizations.

and security pillar will enter its second year. The creation
of a single regional structure at Headquarters for better
internal collaboration on strategy and operations, as
well as the Action for Peacekeeping agenda, are already
bearing fruit. In the year ahead, the United Nations expects
to address the full spectrum of peace and security matters,
from conflict prevention to conflict resolution, peacekeeping
and peacebuilding, in an even more coordinated, coherent
and effective way.

plans and that they contribute
positively to people-centred and

OUTLOOK
The United Nations also continued to support efforts by
the African Union Commission to enhance preparedness
and resilience-building through disaster risk reduction
frameworks.
The United Nations worked with the African Union to
maximize the positive contribution of migration on the
continent and address the related challenges. In that
context, United Nations support has been focused on the
Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration
and the global compact on refugees.
The United Nations will continue to provide sustained
global advocacy on African issues and generate cutting-edge policy research on key priorities while providing
policy advice at the regional and country levels. In that
context, the Organization will advocate and support the
African Union’s efforts to help “silence the guns” by 2020,
advance the African Continental Free Trade Area and
implement the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (resolution
69/313, annex) and the Paris Agreement (FCCC/
CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex). Those efforts will feed into the broader support of the United
Nations for the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
ALIGNMENT WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
Seventy years ago, with the adoption of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly in
its resolution 217 (III), Member States proclaimed the
articles of the Declaration to be the common standard of
achievement for all peoples and nations. They committed
to striving to secure the universal and effective recognition
and observance of those rights and freedoms.
The work we do is
vital, because people’s
human rights are
vital: every individual
has value, and a right
to dignity.”
Michelle Bachelet, High Commissioner
for Human Rights, OHCHR

Over the past seven decades, there have been encouraging
gains in the mission to promote and protect all human
rights for everyone. However, the global march for equal
rights has left many people behind. People continue to
bear the brunt of the turmoil and suffering in conflicts,
resulting in displacement on an unprecedented scale, while
all of humanity is confronted with
the urgent existential threat
of climate change. Outside of
conflict, rising inequality and
unresolved grievances are fuelling resentment, hatred and
violence. The values and progress universalized and promoted
through the multilateral system
are being tested.

PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
KEY RESULTS
In response to those challenges, the United Nations and
its relevant subsidiary organs promote and encourage
respect for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction
as to race, sex, language or religion. In accordance with its
mandate, the Organization focuses on mainstreaming
human rights, promoting the right to development and
conducting research and analysis aimed at the further
integration of all human rights in the work, programmes
and activities of the United Nations system, as well as
enhancing the national capacity of Member States. The
Organization supports human rights treaty bodies and the
Human Rights Council and provides advisory services to
enhance the capacity of Member States, stakeholders and
partners on the ground in advancing human rights for all,
including in crisis situations.

KEY OBJECTIVES
As in prior years, United Nations-supported special
procedures of the Human Rights Council, treaty bodies,
commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions generated
information to help Member States make informed
decisions and address concerns in a timely manner.
Through its technical cooperation projects, the United
Nations enhanced the capacity of more than 50 Member
States in 2018.
Strengthening rule of law and accountability
for human rights violations
The United Nations helped to strengthen the rule of law
capacities of Member States, at their request, and supported them in establishing and enhancing accountability
mechanisms. Accountability is essential for resolving past
conflicts and grievances, while also contributing to the
prevention of violations and abuses. The United Nations
provided expertise on the establishment of transitional
justice mechanisms and supported their daily work, as
well as the work of judicial and civil society actors,
including by contributing to the protection and participation
of victims.
Preventing violations and strengthening
protection of human rights

Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization
Promoting the human rights agenda is a key tool for
preventing human rights violations. The United Nations
continued to engage in alternative dispute-resolution
measures to ensure that the rights of vulnerable persons
were protected, for example in land disputes and in cases
involving tensions between internally displaced persons,
refugees and host communities in West Africa. The
Organization developed human rights-based early warning
tools, which help to protect civilians and prevent the
emergence of new tensions by allowing stakeholders to
be better prepared and intervene earlier.

Enhancing equality and countering

Climate change is at the origin of an increasing number
of migratory flows, posing existential threats and deepening inequality. Through in-depth research on climate
change and human rights protection for cross-border
migrants (see A/HRC/38/21 and A/HRC/37/35), the
United Nations contributed to the development of a
rights-based approach to climate-related migration.
Inclusion of persons with disabilities
The pledge to “leave no one behind” places the human
rights principles of equality and non-discrimination at the
heart of the 2030 Agenda. The Secretariat worked with
United Nations system agencies to bring about a change in
understanding regarding a human rights-based approach
to disability. Progress has been made in moving from a
medical to a social and on to a human rights-based
approach to disability in United Nations system policies,
which now better reflect human rights principles and
standards.
Enhancing participation and protecting
civic space
In its World Development Report 2017,7 the World Bank
estimated that, after continual expansion over the past
decades, civic space is shrinking globally. Amid a crisis of
youth unemployment and marginalization, young people
are becoming one of the most vulnerable groups in
society, at risk of exploitation, violence and insecurity.
Making the voices of youth and children heard in the work
of the United Nations is a matter of the utmost priority.
In 2018, the Committee on the Rights of the Child led by
example and broke with tradition by directly involving
children and young people in its negotiations.

demanding redress with impartiality and being a catalyst
for change to prevent further violations and abuse. This
will include advocating the recommendations of human

OCHA / Anthony Burke
Today, humanitarian crises last longer and affect more
people than ever before. Complex interconnected challenges – including armed conflicts, the adverse impact of
climate change, natural hazards, environmental degradation, epidemics, food and energy insecurity, water scarcity
and financial and economic pressures – are increasing the
vulnerability of people while reducing their ability to cope.
During the year, more than 133 million women, men and
children8 needed humanitarian aid and protection. Nearly
million people remained forcibly displaced because of
conflict, violence and human rights violations – the highest figure ever recorded. More than 60 million people
were directly affected by natural disasters, including
million who were displaced as a result.

KEY OBJECTIVES
“We are focused on
mobilizing the will,
skills and creativity of
the global community
to help save lives and
reduce humanitarian
needs”
In the long term, the United Nations aims to support
Member States in addressing the root causes of risk and
vulnerability and emphasizes the need to “leave no one
behind” in pursuit of the 2030 Agenda. Humanitarian
aid cannot replace political and development solutions.
That is why the United Nations is focused on mobilizing the
will, skills and creativity of the global community to help
end crises and promote development, so that people can
become more resilient to disasters that cannot be avoided.
UNICEF
Mark Lowcock, Under-SecretaryGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs and
Emergency Relief Coordinator
Based on Member States’
mandates, the United Nations
humanitarian programme is
designed to ensure a coordinated, effective and timely
response on the part of the
international community to
disasters and emergencies.
The United Nations advocates
humanitarian principles, promotes knowledge-sharing in
crises, helps to expedite assistance and develops policies
for greater coherence. It also
works with all stakeholders to
reduce the risk and impact of
natural hazards.
WORKING TO IMPROVE HUMANITARIAN
ACCESS TO AVERT FAMINE IN YEMEN
After more than four years of conflict, Yemen – the
site of the world’s most severe humanitarian crisis –
continues to grapple with economic decline,
institutional collapse, massive displacement, cholera
and food insecurity. The United Nations advocated
the improvement of humanitarian access across the
country. As a result, by the end of 2018, 45 out of
local districts that were facing extreme food
insecurity were no longer in a pre-famine phase.

EFFECTIVE COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE
The Security Council unanimously adopts resolution 2417 (2018) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict.
The Central Emergency Response Fund, which provides
funding at the onset of a crisis and for underfunded emergencies, allocated over $500 million to 48 countries/
territories in 2018.10 This included $180 million for 18
chronically underfunded emergencies, the Fund’s largest
allocation ever for forgotten crises. The United Nations
country-based pooled funds channelled a record amount
of $836 million to 686 humanitarian partners in
countries/ territories during the year, with national and
local organizations receiving a quarter of those funds.11
The United Nations also worked to promote effective
knowledge-sharing and advocacy. For example, more
than 9 million people visited reliefweb.org, the world’s
largest humanitarian information site, an increase of
per cent compared with 2017. In total, 16 million
stakeholders consulted United Nations humanitarian
web platforms.

Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization
On many issues, the United Nations worked to advance
policy dialogue. With his report on the protection of
civilians in armed conflict (S/2018/462), for example,
the Secretary-General brought increased attention to
conflict-driven food insecurity. Nearly 80 per cent of the
world’s stunted children now live in conflict-affected
countries. The Security Council, in its resolution 2417
, subsequently recognized the link between armed
conflict and violence, conflict-induced food insecurity and
the threat of famine.

OUTLOOK
In 2019, nearly 142 million people12 will need humanitarian assistance and protection, the majority because of the
impact of conflicts. Many of those crises are compounded
by underdevelopment, fragile institutions and environmental degradation linked to climate change. The
implementation of reform initiatives will offer a unique
opportunity to increase the effectiveness of the
Organization and make it even more fit to help reduce
the underlying drivers of crises. Increasingly, the United
Nations and its partners will seek to meet humanitarian
needs and to strengthen collaboration with development
partners in accordance with their mandates.

Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization
PROMOTION OF JUSTICE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW
The first substantive session of the intergovernmental
conference to draft an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of
marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction was held in 2018. The deliberations, which were
assisted by a president’s aid to negotiations that was prepared to facilitate focused and text-based negotiations,
provided a good basis for the future work of the
conference.
At the request of the Security Council, the United Nations
Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes
Committed by Da’esh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
(UNITAD) – one of the first international accountability
mechanisms of its kind – was established. The United
Nations legal team helped to prepare its terms of reference, which were approved by the Council in February
UNITAD will support domestic efforts to hold ISIL
accountable by collecting, preserving and storing evidence
of acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against
humanity or genocide committed by ISIL in Iraq.
Following the decision of the Human Rights Council in
to establish an independent mechanism to collect,
consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the most
serious international crimes and violations of international
law committed by Myanmar and the adoption by the
General Assembly of its resolution 73/264, in which it
called for the mechanism’s expeditious entry into operation, United Nations legal teams helped to establish and
operationalize the mechanism, including by preparing the
terms of reference, which were distributed to the
Assembly in January 2019.
The International Court of
Justice
considered
many
high-profile cases in 2018, including one request from the
General Assembly for an advisory opinion on the legal
consequences of the separation
of the Chagos Archipelago
from Mauritius in 1965. On 25
February 2019, the Court issued
its advisory opinion, in which it
concluded, inter alia, that the
process of decolonization of
Mauritius had not been lawfully
completed when that country
acceded to independence in
1968, following the separation
of the Chagos Archipelago.

DISARMAMENT
ALIGNMENT WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
With protracted conflicts causing large-scale human
suffering, the international security environment continues
to deteriorate. Armed groups are proliferating, equipped
with a vast array of weapons. Global military spending
and arms competition are increasing, and the tensions of
the cold war have returned to a world that has grown
more complex. New threats are beginning to shape
the lives of future generations, including the possible
weaponization of artificial intelligence, cyberspace and
outer space. In today’s multipolar
environment, the mechanisms for
contact and dialogue between
super-Powers that once helped
to defuse tensions are eroding.
This new reality demands that
disarmament and non-proliferation be put at the centre of the
work of the United Nations.

KEY OBJECTIVES
KEY RESULTS
In that context, the United Nations strives to help Member
States to reconcile disparate positions on disarmament,
share expertise, create space for dialogue and advance
solutions. The Organization’s disarmament programme
focuses on supporting multilateral negotiations, the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, other weapons of
mass destruction and conventional weapons, regional
disarmament efforts and public awareness efforts.
In 2018, the United Nations supported the ongoing
preparations for the 2020 Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear
Weapons, a framework that has become vital in the light
of increased competition between nuclear-armed States
and the erosion of the nuclear arms control regime.

The United Nations also provided substantive and procedural support to the Conference on Disarmament. Despite
heightened tensions at the international level, the
Conference was able to establish five subsidiary bodies
on all substantive agenda items and issued four reports.

United Nations system, build better partnerships in
support of disarmament, peace and security, and the
Agenda, and advance more practical measures
for better Member State support.

In the area of conventional arms, the United Nations continued to support Member States in developing a political
declaration and practical measures to mitigate the humanitarian harm and devastation caused by the use of
explosive weapons in populated areas. It also assisted in
preparing the successful outcome of the Third United
Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the
Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent,
Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and
Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. For the first time,
Member States reached a consensus to recognize ammunition as part of the challenge.
To advance the dialogue on the security impact of new
science and technology, the United Nations issued a report on current developments in science and technology
and their potential impact on international security and
disarmament, including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, space-based and electromagnetic technologies
(A/73/177). To ensure human control over the use of
force, the Organization also assisted an expert group,
which adopted a set of proposed guiding principles.
In support of regional disarmament, the United Nations
accelerated its work with partners. In 2018, more than
cooperation projects were active. For example, the
Organization helped countries in the Sahel region in reducing the risk that small arms, light weapons and
ammunition would be diverted. As a result, six countries
in the region now have legislative norms on arms security
and stockpile management.
As in previous years, the United Nations fostered the
accumulation of knowledge on disarmament. For example, it published a new handbook entitled Effective
Weapons and Ammunition Management in a Changing
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration
Context.13 In addition, the Organization adopted an internal action plan to better align its activities with the
Sustainable Development Goals.
OUTLOOK
Reinvigorated disarmament dialogue can help to advance
many global objectives, including sustainable development, humanitarian action, human rights, gender equality
and peace and security. In the year ahead, disarmament
solutions that carry wide and consensual support will
likely remain difficult to find. New threats and weaponry,
however, will make the disarmament dialogue more urgent than ever.

DRUG CONTROL, CRIME PREVENTION AND COMBATING TERRORISM
CONTEXT
KEY OBJECTIVES
Transnational organized crime, corruption and terrorism
continue to pose major threats to security, development
and good governance around the world. Drugs create
risks for millions of people, lead to the loss of life and
seriously deplete social cohesion and capital. According
to the United Nations World Drug Report 2018,14 more
than 31 million people suffer from drug-use disorders.
In this context, the work of
the United Nations is grounded
in a series of international instruments: the 3 international
drug control conventions, the
United Nations Convention
against Corruption, the United
Nations Convention against

while promoting security and

areas ranging from transnational organized crime to illicit
trafficking, from drug prevention and treatment and alternative development to corruption, from criminal justice
reform to terrorism prevention and from research to policy
support.
Organized crime, including cybercrime, trafficking in
persons, the smuggling of migrants and environmental
crime, undermine the rule of law. Cybercrime is estimated
to generate some $1.5 trillion in revenue each year. Profits
accruing to globally operating migrant-smuggling networks total at least $5.5 billion. Moreover, homicides
and other types of organized crime-related violence remain
high across many regions of the world. Corruption
adversely affects the rule of law, security and governance,
denying many people access to adequate services and
opportunities.

on the world drug problem, the United Nations undertook
several initiatives in 2018. For example, the Organization

The United Nations supported Member States in their
implementation of sustainable strategies for controlling
illicit crops and fostering alternative livelihoods, as well
as in enhancing law enforcement capacity. United Nations
assistance resulted in seizures of heroin, opium and
other illicit substances, including in challenging regions
where capacity is inadequate and the trafficking of such
commodities fuels regional instability. Most notably, in
Afghanistan, mobile detection teams supported by the
United Nations conducted more than 3,500 operations,
resulting in significant seizures of heroin, opium and other
illicit substances, as well as the arrest of nearly 1,000
suspects in those cases.
DRUG CONTROL, CRIME PREVENTION AND COMBATING TERRORISM
Crime prevention
In assisting Member States with the development of crime
prevention policies, the United Nations promoted the use
of such tools as the International Classification of Crime
for Statistical Purposes and integrated monitoring systems,
which help countries to collect information and produce
high-quality data on such topics as illicit crops, emerging
crime dynamics and victimization.
in Persons 201815 provided evidence of how armed conflict contributes directly to trafficking in persons, increasing
the vulnerability of displaced persons and providing greater opportunities for criminal activity.
The United Nations provided capacity-building assistance
to law enforcement agencies in Africa, Latin America and
Asia and the Pacific and enhanced the capacity of more
than 30 countries to effectively address wildlife, forest
and fisheries crime. In the area of human trafficking,
Member States received support in better understanding
“dark figures” on trafficking in persons. The United
Nations “multiple systems estimation methodology”
makes it possible to calculate overall as well as disaggregated victimization rates, giving a clearer indication of
where national victim identification efforts might need to
be stepped up. In addition, the Global Report on Trafficking
A landmark achievement in the area of crime prevention
in 2018 was the adoption by the Conference of the Parties
to the United Nations Convention against Transnational
Organized Crime at its ninth session of a mechanism for
the review of the implementation of the Convention, in
which Member States are encouraged to share experiences and lessons learned. The United Nations will support
those exchange efforts and provide expert support on
crime prevention matters. Furthermore, the Organization
contributed to target 16.4 of the Sustainable Development
Goals by helping Member States to counter illicit financial
and arms flows through such evidence-based approaches
as criminal intelligence-led policing, profiling and the
use of special investigative techniques, cross-border
cooperation on judicial and financial intelligence matters
and the identification and monitoring of illicit trafficking
in firearms.

Combating terrorism
The threat of terrorism remained acute and was exacerbated by such emerging challenges as suspected foreign
terrorist fighters returning or relocating, as well as the
growing nexus between terrorism and transnational organized crime.
The United Nations helped to convene the first High-level
Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of
Member States to promote and enhance international
counter-terrorism cooperation. It also launched the Global
Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact and its first consolidated multi-year donor appeal to improve system-wide
coordination, resource mobilization and assistance delivery. Those efforts enhanced practical cooperation
between the Secretariat and Security Council-mandated
bodies in line with Council resolution 2395 (2017).
The United Nations also supported Member States in
implementing counter-terrorism strategies in Central Asia,
East Africa, Southern Africa and West Africa. More than
countries received support for their efforts to prevent
and counter violent extremism where it could be conducive
to terrorism.

KEY WORKSTREAMS
KEY RESULTS
Several operational processes underpin the functioning of
the United Nations Secretariat, with its annual resources
of about $13 billion and more than 37,000 civilian staff in
duty stations. Many of those processes are being
substantially overhauled in 2018/19 as a result of the
Secretary-General’s management reform initiative. They
include the management of finance, human resources, information and communications technology, supply chains,
facilities, conference services, and security and safety operations, as well as the communication of the Organization’s
work and the strengthening of relations with the principal
organs of the United Nations, Member States and
other stakeholders.
In 2018, the United Nations laid the foundation for an ambitious management reform initiative that became effective
in 2019. In shifting its management paradigm, the United
Nations is putting the strongest emphasis on transparency,
accountability and better implementation of mandates.
Effective 1 January 2019, the Office of the Secretary-General
launched a simplified and streamlined framework for the
delegation of managerial authority to more than 200 heads
of United Nations entities to cut through bureaucracy and
bring decision-making closer to the point of delivery. The
Organization began to simplify administrative policies and
strengthened its internal accountability framework. It also
put in place dashboards to convey performance and compliance data to managers in more timely, reliable and
user-friendly ways. Furthermore, the Organization improved
its formal programme and performance documentation to
present a better overview of results to the General Assembly,
aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. For the
first time in its history, the United Nations achieved gender
parity among senior management.

To facilitate multilateral dialogue and decision-making of
Member States, the Secretariat
continued to provide conference services, with multilingual
support whenever mandated.
The Organization serviced
more than 35,000 intergovernmental meetings or conferences
in New York, Geneva, Vienna
and Nairobi and provided more
than 4,500 documents and
other materials. To strengthen
inclusive multilingualism, the
Organization also expanded its
pool of conference interpreters
and translators from traditionally
underrepresented regions.
ETHICS AND STAFF SUPPORT
In 2018, the United Nations responded to a higher number of internal requests for confidential ethics advice and
guidance on whistle-blower protection. Responsiveness
improved, with the average number of days for preliminary reviews dropping by 50 per cent, to 13 days. More
than 31,000 staff participated in leadership dialogues on
whistle-blowing and a stronger policy against retaliation
for reporting wrongdoing. The number of tips on
potential wrongdoing increased, suggesting greater
awareness of reporting options and increased confidence
in the system. To help improve the work environment,
the United Nations Ombudsman launched a civility
campaign and assisted more than 2,700 staff with a
safe space, a confidential ear and independent advice
on workplace challenges.

COMBATING HARASSMENT AND ABUSE
The United Nations continued to advance its victim-centred, zero-tolerance approach to sexual misconduct. It approved a system-wide
model policy on sexual harassment, informed by the first-ever staff
survey on the issue. A 24-hour “Speak up” helpline was set up in
2018, and a new Clear Check database now makes it possible to vet
job candidates across all United Nations system entities to prevent the
rehiring of perpetrators of sexual misconduct. The Organization also
introduced a database to better assist victims of sexual exploitation
and abuse. Victims’ rights advocates began to deploy to the field, and
a new group of sexual misconduct investigators was set up.

Commission on Population and Development
Fifty-third session
March–3 April 2020
Item 3 (b) of the provisional agenda
General debate: population, food security, nutrition and
sustainable development
Programmes and interventions for the implementation of
the Programme of Action of the International Conference
on Population and Development in the context of
population, food security, nutrition and
sustainable development
Report of the Secretary-General
Summary
The present report has been prepared to inform the Commission ’s deliberations
on population, food security, nutrition and sustainable development. More than
years of nutrition research has identified human requirements for optimal nutrition,
and the interventions needed to ensure access to healthy diets for all, and
corresponding Sustainable Development Goal targets. Highly effective investments
include nutrition for the maternal-infant dyad, promotion of breastfeeding,
fortification of foods, taxation and regulatory measures, and school-based feeding.
Integration of nutrition within universal health coverage offers the potential to greatly
expand nutrition coverage and boost health outcomes. Ending malnutrition in all its
forms, including the hidden hunger of nutrient deficiency, requires national
commitments to invest at scale.
Simultaneously, the rising epidemic of obesity and overweight requires urgent
action by many stakeholders. Mild or intermittent food insecurity appears to increase
obesity and overweight, compounding health risks for populations most vulnerable to
food insecurity. Policy interventions are urgently needed to increase the share of total
consumption composed of nutritious foods and beverages; promising evidence
suggests that media campaigns, better nourishment in public institutions, fiscal
measures and restrictions on food and beverage marketing all warrant wider
consideration.

Core challenges of food security are sustainable production and distribution, and
protecting the populations most vulnerable owing to conflict, humanitarian crisis,
climate or economic shocks. Food production has increased significantly over the past
years, but at the cost of land degradation, biodiversity loss and pollution, especially
where there has been unregulated use of pesticides and fertilizers. Recent United
Nations recommendations on microbicide use should be widely adopted, and there is
urgent need to promote sustainable agricultural prac tices in order to protect the longterm resilience of agriculture for future populations.

I. Introduction
The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and
Development endorsed a vision of integrated development anchored on: principles of
non-discrimination and equality; the centrality of health, education and women ’s
empowerment to sustainable development; and the collective need for environmental
sustainability. These ideals underpin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
the corresponding Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
Food and nutrition are foundations of human development, as reflected within
regional and global development agendas, within the mandates of multiple United
Nations agencies and by the establishment of unique United Nations bodies 1 devoted
to food security. The Programme of Action prescribed that measures should be taken
to strengthen food, nutrition and agricultural policies and programmes and fair trade
relations, with special attention paid to the creation and strengthening of food security
at all levels. In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, food is a common
thread linking the economic, social and environmental dimensions of all 17 Goals,
and the United Nations has endorsed the Framework for Action adopted by 164 Member
States at the Second International Conference on Nutrition 2 and declared the United
Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025).
The economic costs of malnutrition are staggering, costing society an estimated
$3.5 trillion per year, with overweight and obesity alone costing $500 billion per year.
Costs are incurred through increased health-care costs, impaired learning, poor school
performance and compromised adult labour productivity. At the individual level, adult
earnings are reduced by 2.4 per cent for every 1 per cent loss in potential attained
height, 3 a marker of nutritional status.
Attaining the Sustainable Development Goal targets to end hunger and achieve
food security (Goal 2), attain good health and well-being (Goal 3), eradicate poverty
(Goal 1), conserve and use marine and land resources sustainably (Goals 14 and 15)
and mitigate the impact of climate change (Goal 13) remain a daunting task at a time
when an estimated 822 million people worldwide are undernourished, 4 nearly 2 billion
adults are facing overweight or obesity 5 and approximately 650 million live in
conditions of extreme poverty. The world produces adequate food for all and has sound
empirical knowledge about the requirements for optimal nutrition . The double burden
of malnutrition – undernutrition and hidden hunger, overweight and obesity and dietrelated noncommunicable diseases – remains however among the leading causes of
death and disability globally and continues to threaten the survival, growth and
development of children, young people, economies and nations.
Food security, nutrition and climate change are inextricably linked . Efforts to
assure nutrition and food security for all will require coordinated, evidence -based
policies to improve all four pillars of food security – availability, access, utilization
and stability – and more assertive measures to address climate change. Technological

innovation can play a valuable role in these efforts, but coordinated political
leadership is crucial.
In the context of the fifty-third session of the Commission on Population and
Development, the present report highlights global and regional interventions to address
food security and nutrition and areas of greater research need. The report should be
regarded as a companion piece to the report of the Secretary-General (E/CN.9/2020/2).
II. Nutrition, population and sustainable development
A.Impact of undernutrition on growth, health and development
In today’s world, hunger is caused by poverty and inequality, not scarcity.
Nonetheless, diets lacking adequate nutrition are a leading contributor to deaths
worldwide, as malnutrition heightens risk for both infectious and non-communicable
diseases. 6 Suboptimal diet is responsible for more deaths than any other behavioural,
environmental or occupational risk globally, including tobacco smoking. Malnutrition
exists in multiple forms: undernutrition, as stunting or wasting, overweight and
obesity; and hidden hunger or micronutrient deficiencies. Globally, at least one in
three (almost 200 million) children under 5 years of age is undernourished or
underweight and one in two (around 340 million) suffers from hidden hunger due to
deficiencies in vitamins and other essential nutrients. Africa and Asia account for
more than 9 out of 10 stunted children and over 9 out of 10 wasted children.
Rates of overweight and obesity have increased sharply wo rldwide, with a
tenfold increase in the number of obese children and adolescents from 1975 to 2016. 7
The prevalence of adult obesity has nearly tripled over the same period, with
approximately 2 billion adults now overweight or obese, contributing to 4 million
deaths per year and the loss of 120 million healthy years of life worldwide. 8
The highest burden of all forms of malnutrition is shouldered by the poorest
communities. Gender inequality and other forms of discrimination further impact
individual food security and access to nutrients. Population ageing also raises new
challenges for assuring optimal nutrition throughout the life cycle.
Multiple forms of malnutrition can co-exist within the same country, household
and even within an individual. A normal body mass index, for example, does not protect
against micronutrient deficiencies, which can reflect poor diet quality. Globally, the
problem of malnutrition is clearly shifting from one dominated by undernutrition to a
more complex burden of malnutrition, including unhealthy eating.
Micronutrients are essential to healthy growth and development and have
enabled life-saving interventions. For example, since vitamin A supplementation was
found to significantly reduce all-cause mortality among children, the World Health
Organization (WHO) has recommended provision of vitamin A to all infants and
children aged 6 to 59 months where vitamin A is deficient. Micronutrient deficiencies
can also be addressed through food fortification, whereby micronutrients are added
to staple foods. To date, 140 countries have mandated iodization of salt, 86 countries

have mandated the fortification of at least one staple cereal flour and 49 countries
have mandated the fortification of edible oils.
B.
A fair start for all: universal nutrition during pregnancy
and childhood
The interlinkages of nutrition, food security and reproductive health are striking.
Undernutrition in pregnancy increases the risks of obstructed labour, premature
births, low-birth-weight babies, and postpartum haemorrhage. Nearly 15 per cent of
babies born in 2015 were of low birth weight and more likely to die during their first
month of life; those who survived face lifelong consequences, including a higher risk
of stunted growth, risks for cognitive development, and adult-onset conditions such
as obesity and diabetes. 9 Chronic undernutrition delays maturation and extends the
adolescent growth period, overlapping with pregnancy where child marriage and early
childbearing remain in force. Early pregnancy in a young undernourished female
negatively impacts her own growth, and short intervals between births worsen
pregnancy outcomes.
Developmental demands of the fetus increase micronutrient requirements and
the risk for deficiencies that affect maternal and newborn health and mortality. In
2016, one in three women of reproductive age (15–49 years) was anaemic, increasing
the risk for haemorrhage, the leading cause of maternal death (23 per cent of total
deaths). As compared with North America and Europe, the anaemia prevalence rate
in Africa and Asia is more than double. In areas of moderate to high malaria
transmission, the risk of maternal anaemia is much higher, compounding the risk of
fetal growth retardation, low birth weight and low weight for age. Child marriage and
early pregnancies lead to added risks: initial pregnancy has a higher malaria parasite
load, and the younger a mother, the worse her nutritional preconditions for pregnancy.
In malaria-endemic regions, iron supplementation and presumptive curative treatment
of malaria among pregnant women, followed by preventive treatment, is a cost effective intervention: when implemented as part of routine antenatal care it
significantly reduces maternal anaemia, and increases infant birthweights and reduces
stunting. The global prevalence of maternal anaemia could be reduced by one -third
to one half if action were taken to support focused, large-scale programmes. 10
The development and economic losses associated with malnutrition are largely
preventable. Adequate investments should be made in proven interventions, in
particular during the crucial 1,000-day window of pregnancy and the first two years
of life. Lack of universal access to optimal nutrition among girls, pregnant women
and infants can be traced to shortfalls in financing and political commitments, to
gender discriminatory norms and practices, including the failure to avoid forced and
early marriage, and unmet need for family planning. In 2012, the World Health
Assembly endorsed the Comprehensive Implementation Plan on M aternal, Infant and
Young Child Nutrition, 11 highlighting the need for a multifaceted, multisectoral, life course approach to address the burden of malnutrition globally.
Maternal health and nutrition interventions are highly cost-effective, yielding
permanent and inalienable benefits. Where underweight is prevalent, balanced energy protein supplementation for pregnant women who are undernourished promotes
gestational weight gain and improved birth outcomes. 11 Antenatal micronutrient

supplementation is a low-cost and feasible way to improve birth outcomes, which in
turn reduces stunting risk, low birthweight and small-for-gestational-age births. 12 The
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) multiple micronutrient preparation
supplement contains 14 micronutrients at levels appropriate for daily intake during
pregnancy.
After birth, maternal nutrition is crucial, as breastfeeding underpins child
nutrition through its wide-ranging benefits for a child’s immunity, brain and
microbiome development, and for reduction of non-communicable diseases later in
life. Breastfed children perform better on intelligence tests, are less likely to be
overweight or obese, and are less prone to diabetes later in life. Women who
breastfeed also have a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers, overweight/obesity,
type 2 diabetes and hypertension. 13 Globally, nearly three out of five infants are not
exclusively breastfed for the recommended six months. 14 Teenage mothers face
unique challenges to breastfeeding, with less experience in infant feeding, and
unplanned pregnancy is associated with poorer breastfeeding practice. Laws to
protect, promote and support breastfeeding are inadequate. Only 39 countries have
laws that enact all provisions of the International Code of Marketin g of Breast-milk
Substitutes. The duration of paid maternity leave promotes breastfeeding, as returning
to work is associated with early interruption of breastfeeding. Evidence suggests that
mass media campaigns are important for increasing national breast feeding rates.
Interventions that ensure adequate nutrition for children aged 6 –24 months
significantly improve weight and height z-scores. School feeding programmes can
measurably improve nutrition and reduce stunting among school-aged children in
food-insecure populations. 15 School breakfast programmes, in particular, provide
significant nutritional benefits, 16 with net fiscal benefits from $206 million to
$3.1 billion. 17 Social protection programmes can support healthy eating and promote
dietary diversity. Community management for the treatment of severe acute
malnutrition has improved survival rates and is highly cost effective. It empowers
families to treat the condition at home with ready-to-use therapeutic foods, and local
production of such foods can lower costs. Management of severe acute malnutrition
is among the 10 highest-impact nutritional interventions to reduce child mortality. 18
Nutrition interventions should also target older persons, who may experience
malnutrition due to loss of appetite, decrease in the body’s ability to process food,
social isolation or depression, household discrimination or limited ability to shop and
prepare food. Evidence from Finland shows that dietary counselling can improve
nutritional status among community-dwelling older persons, even if it is not

provision of meals, food enhancements to improve absorption, supplementation and
community support.
C.
Global rise of unhealthy diets and new patterns of disease
Food production, marketing and broader social changes over the past 50 years
have shifted global dietary patterns to those characterized by increased consumption
of foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and inadequate intake of
fruits, vegetables and dietary fibre. These changes have led to a rising global epidemic
of overweight and obesity, which now contributes to 4 million deaths globally. 20
Since 1975, there has been a tenfold increase in overweight and obesity among
children and adolescents, in particular in countries with a high burden of
communicable, maternal, and nutritional conditions, contributing to type 2 diabetes,
asthma, sleeping disorders, liver disease and the psychological consequences of low
self-esteem. Childhood overweight and obesity often persist into adulthood, resulting
in increased risk of adult type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Promoting a significant shift away from unhealthy diets towards more nutritious
dietary patterns requires the involvement of multiple sectors and stakeholders,
including government, and the public and private sectors. The regulatory environment
around school feeding is key to limiting exposure to high-calorie and low-nutrient
foods, and to ensuring the adoption of healthy eating habits early in life. Access to
safe piped drinking water in schools is crucial, providing a healthy alternative to
sugar-sweetened beverages.
Governments can support programmes to promote healthy dietary habits or to
discourage unhealthy habits. In developed countries, vouchers for fruit and vegetable
purchases have increased such consumption. Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages – a
policy lever used to discourage excessive consumption 21 – have been enacted in 73
countries. Education about healthy diets is necessary but not sufficient, since
consumers make choices based also on taste, price and exposure to advertising. In lowincome and middle-income countries, behaviour change communication programmes
have been tested to promote healthier dietary habits, 22 but more research is needed on
effective consumer messaging. WHO “best buys” for cost-effective interventions to
ameliorate unhealthy diets 23 include behaviour change communication and front-ofpack labelling; elimination of industrial trans-fats; taxation on sugar-sweetened
beverages; reduction of salt intake through reformulation; and provision of lower salt
options in public institutions.
Influencing public demand for healthy diets depends on food -based dietary
guidelines that address inadequate intake of some food groups, while reducing excess
consumption of others. Currently, 91 of the 193 States Members of the United Nations
have such guidelines, among the 54 African Member States, only 7 do. Food-based

dietary guidelines should also consider long-term dietary sustainability in the light of
climate change. The Continental Nutrition Accountability Scorecard for Africa brings
an additional governance and accountability mechanism, targeting heads of State and
finance ministers for commitments made to agriculture development and nutrition.
D.
Nutrition and universal health coverage
Good nutrition is fundamental to achieving the right to health. No country can
achieve universal health coverage without investing in nutrition, and go od nutrition
cannot be achieved without universal health coverage. Suboptimal diets are the single
largest driver of morbidity and mortality in the world, more than tobacco smoking or
hypertension. 24 Despite continuous improvements in economic development, rates of
malnutrition remain unacceptably high. One reason is that nutrition has not been
systematically addressed within health systems, and the rise in unhealthy diets has
undermined other health gains. Mainstreaming a package of nutrition interventions
within universal health coverage offers a cost-effective means to improve lifetime
health.
Governments have the opportunity to accelerate fulfilment of the Programme of
Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, Sustainable
Development Goal targets, goals of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition,
and universal health coverage itself, by developing and funding nationally tailored
nutrition actions within universal health coverage. A suite of ready -to-scale nutrition
interventions of proven effectiveness is available. 25 Such interventions are highly
cost-effective, with $1 invested in nutrition yielding estimated returns ranging
between $4 and $35. Nutrition interventions offer particularly valuable health benefits
to the poorest households and communities, for whom intergenerational health
implications can be extreme.
III. Food security and population well-being
While poverty and the percentage of people who lack adequate food have
declined since the turn of the century, the number of people who are food insecure
and undernourished, as well as overweight and obese, has risen. Food insecurity refers
to a lack of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary quality, disrupts
normal eating patterns, and coincides with eating patterns that heighten the risk of
overweight and obesity. Components of food security include availability, access,
utilization and stability (see figure I).

countries, 1990–2017”.

Availability
While global food production should be sufficient for all, distribution limits
availability, and current agricultural trends risk future productivity. The proportion of
global land being used for human activity including agriculture has increased
significantly over the past 50 years. Currently food production occupies 50 per cent of
the Earth’s habitable land, and accounts for 70 per cent of freshwater consumption. 26
The corresponding loss of natural ecosystems has had “unprecedented” negative effects
on global biodiversity, 27 destroying habitats that harboured wild genetic relatives of
current food crops, which are important or the long-term resilience of agriculture. An
estimated $577 billion in annual global crops are currently at risk from pollinator loss
alone.
While the land area devoted to agriculture has expanded, the diversity of
cultivated field crops has actually declined. In many parts of the world, biodiverse
agricultural landscapes have been, or are being, replaced by large areas of
monoculture. Of more than 6,000 plant species cultivated for food production, just
nine (sugar cane, maize, rice, wheat, potatoes, soybeans, oil palm fruit, sugar beet and
cassava) account for 66 per cent of total crop production and fewer than 200
contribute significantly to food production globally, regionally or nationally. 28

Urgent policy investment is needed to guide a crop framework focused on
achieving global goals for nutrition and long-term food security. Numerous
interventions are under way to promote greater biodiversity, soil health, and
sustainable agriculture, and some are moving to scale. “Save and grow” practices,
such as low-tillage farming, water-efficient cropping and ecology-friendly pest
management have been successfully applied to crops such as rice, cassava and other
staples, with smallholder farmers as primary drivers. The implementation of the zero tillage on the Indo-Gangetic Plain set a precedent for farms keeping soil covers for
higher yields and less fuel use.
To assure distribution while reducing the environmental impact of global food
transport, national policy interventions must engage both large agriculture and
smallholders. More than 80 per cent of the approximately 600 million family farms
(representing more than 2.5 billion people) worldwide are smaller than 2 hectares,
and in low-income and middle-income countries, a significant share of food
consumed by the poor is produced locally by smallholders. 29
Forests are a source of food, medicine and fuel for more than 1 billion people,
and sustain a range of industries. However, native forest cover has declined by
approximately 6 per cent since 1990; the Brazilian Amazon alone lost 22,827 km 2 of
forest between 2015 and 2018. Forest loss results in biodiversity loss, release of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, loss of livelihoods for rural communities and
land degradation. Successful reversal of such trends is possible. The successful
re-greening of the Sahel in Burkina Faso used agroforestry to rehabilitate arid
landscapes into productive land. In the Niger in the 1980s, farmers experimented with
low-cost ways of reproducing and generating trees and shrubs that provide food, fuel
and fodder, and 1.25 million trees have been added every year. 30
Nearly 3.2 billion people receive 20 per cent of their daily animal protein intake
from fish, yet in 2015 the United Nations estimated that 33 per cent of marine fish
stocks were being harvested at unsustainable levels, an increase from 10 per cent in
Marine plastic pollution has increased tenfold since 1980, and the ability of
oceans to provide food for future generations is at risk. Innovative management of
fisheries can improve sustainability. The sixth Global Environment Outlook
highlighted the Territorial Use Rights for Fishing policy of Chile to encourage
sustainable fishing of abalone by reducing overfishing, encouraging stewardship and
offering communities sanctioning mechanisms to hold them accountab le. 31
Many policy tools affecting food availability show evidence of success,
including better animal husbandry and health, improved water management, better
land governance and pesticide and fertilizer regulations. Government-to-Government
policy exchange is encouraged, along with more research on sustainable agricultural
practices, including strategies for soil restoration, increasing crop nutrient density and
carbon capture.
Access is the principal channel through which the fragility of the h ousehold
economy and national economic shocks can lead to food insecurity. More than
million people in 33 countries who suffered from acute food insecurity in 2018
lived in places where the economy was undergoing economic shocks. High food
prices pose a threat to agricultural markets and food security, especially among those

most economically vulnerable. Despite the decline in world food prices in the past
decade, one in four countries in Africa and Western Asia, and one in five in Central
and Southern Asia, experienced high food prices in 2016 and 2017. Landlocked
developing countries were particularly prone to high food prices, with about one third
of countries affected during the same period. 32
Healthy utilization of food depends on food safety; avoiding food contamination
from production, post-harvest, and/or storage practices; and limiting food waste.
Globally, nearly 420,000 people die annually from contaminated food, 30 per cent of
whom are children under 5, with the highest death rates in sub -Saharan Africa and
Asia. 33 The Framework for Action includes a set of five recommended policy actions
on food safety and antimicrobial resistance. 34 Aflatoxins, a contaminate of grains,
cause 5 to 30 per cent of all liver cancer in the world and are associated with growth
retardation and immunosuppression. 35 Control of aflatoxin requires awareness
education and the mainstreaming of good regulatory practice. In Nigeria , the
introduction of an adapted biocontrol product called Aflasafe, using native fungi,
decreased aflatoxin contamination of maize and groundnut by 70 to 95 per cent. 36
The extensive use of antimicrobials in livestock and aquaculture is of serious
concern given the global threat of antimicrobial resistance for animals and humans.
Antibiotic use in agriculture and aquaculture for growth promotion and disease
prevention are increasingly identified with human health risks. The report to the
Secretary-General by the Inter Agency Coordination Group on Anti-Microbial
Resistance in April 2019 calls on Member States to phase out the use of antimicrobials
for growth promotion in livestock farming, according to guidance from the Tripartite
agencies (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World
Organization for Animal Health and WHO) and the Codex Alimentarius, starting with
an immediate end to the use of those on the WHO list of critically important
antimicrobials for human medicine. 37 Sustainable animal husbandry practices can
reduce infections and dependence on antibiotics, and monitoring of antimicrobial use
(and that of fertilizers and pesticides), should be part of government or civil society
monitoring of agricultural practice. For Africa, such monitoring is recommended as
part of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme.
While many countries have established national laws and practices in an effort
to reduce pesticide harm, levels of protection vary significantly. Without
standardized, stringent regulations on the production, sale and acceptable levels of
pesticides, severe health effects will continue to affect agricultural workers, their
children and poor communities in countries with weak regulatory systems. In some
low-income countries, pesticide poisoning exceeds deaths from infectious diseases.
Pesticides containing industrial chemicals and organic pollutants are associated with
endocrine disruption, infertility, pregnancy loss, pre -term delivery and congenital

abnormalities. 38 Early-life exposure to pesticides can affect the quality of sperm
across multiple generations of men. 39
Finally, about 14 per cent of the world’s food is lost before reaching the retail
level, and a variable proportion of highly perishable products (14 –37 per cent of
animal products, 9–20 per cent of fruits and vegetables) are wasted after retail. 40
Pioneering cities have developed food strategies and food policy councils to
coordinate food distribution and reduce waste, and more multisectoral and cross government approaches are needed to simultaneously reduce waste and increase
access to fresh and nutritious foods.
Stability is affected by exposure to new sociocultural food traditions, on
environmental change and changes in availability and access. Despite enormous
variety in national food systems and cultures, the past five decades have seen global
trends towards greater meat consumption, higher sugar intake, greater intake of highly
processed foods and more saturated fat in global average diets.
Policy experiments to reverse these trends remain fragmented, but many policy
cases suggest high returns on investment. Particularly cost-effective are dietary
interventions focused on the mother-child dyad, and those undertaken in schools. The
public sector can use large public institutions, such as scho ols or hospitals, to improve
food stability. In Brazil, for example, the Government used a public acquisition
programme to simultaneously link a school feeding programme and advocacy for
local farmers to grow more nutritious foods, under its Zero Hunger initiative, whereby
per cent of all purchases for school feeding come from smallholder agriculture. 41
The World Food Programme (WFP) has promoted home-grown school feeding
interventions in Africa, incorporating nutrition as a goal. Private sector promotion of
healthier eating can enhance productivity and job satisfaction, for example, where
businesses provide on-site meals for workers.
Human geography is changing quickly, making new demands on food stability.
With more than half of the world’s population living in urban areas, decisions on how
to nourish growing urban populations will have major consequences for food security.
Peri-urban agriculture will likely need to play a larger role in the nourishment of
urban populations, if they are to simultaneously reduce food transport. To address the
problem of unhealthy urban diets, the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, signed by 98
cities around the world, aims to “develop sustainable food systems that are inclusive,
resilient, safe and diverse”, to provide nutritious and affordable food to all people. 42
Other city-level actions include school-based advocacy and learning, the promotion
of urban farming and support for a wide distribution of local farmers markets.
Recognizing that cities and countries vary considerably in food systems, the Fill
the Nutrient Gap tool used by WFP helps to assess nutritional status and identify
public barriers to following a healthy diet. Broader use of such assessments is
warranted, with results used to coordinate multisectoral policies for assuring stable
and reliable access to nutritious foods for all.

A.
Who is most food insecure?
The highest rates of poverty, hunger, and child stunting are found in low -income
countries, with the largest absolute numbers of hungry children and those affected by
stunting (149 million) living in Asia. Children living in poverty are the most likely to
be underfed and malnourished and experience stunting. However, disparities in
stunting within countries vary considerably: there is an elevenfold difference in
stunting between the richest and the poorest children in Peru, while closer to fivefold
differences in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Gabon, Honduras and Jordan. 43
On every continent, the prevalence of food insecurity is hig her among women.
As primary caregivers, women play a crucial role in child feeding, yet they face
gender-based violence and harmful practices, intrahousehold discrimination,
restrictions to their education and employment opportunities and gender-biased laws
that limit their access to land ownership and financing. Women are disproportionately
represented among landless populations facing food insecurity.
Socially excluded and marginalized groups face greater risk of malnutrition.
Globally, nearly 370 million indigenous people endure harsh environmental and
socioeconomic conditions. The rate of stunting among Brazilian indigenous groups
in 2013 was two to five times higher than that among non-indigenous groups. 44
Children in the most disadvantaged ethnic groups in low-income and middle-income
countries have on average 2.8 times the rate of stunting and 6 times the rate of wasting
compared with their more advantaged peers. 45 Disability can be both a cause and
consequence of malnutrition; stigma around disability can result in newborns not
being breastfed or children being given less nutritious or smaller portions of food.
The Government of Brazil is addressing marginalization and food insecurity by
mainstreaming hunger eradication within the Fome Zero prog ramme and its flagship
conditional cash transfer programme, The Bolsa Família programme, which has
reduced extreme poverty by 25 per cent since 2004. Although an increasing number
of studies have stressed the positive role of cash transfer programmes for i ncreasing
access to food and health care, the evidence to date on child nutrition is mixed on
whether cash transfer positively impacts growth-related outcomes among children. 46
Geographical remoteness also determines whether a family or person has acces s
to essential foods, health care and nutrition services. Stunting rates among the poorest
urban populations can be as high or higher than rates among poor rural children, but
two-thirds of the world’s stunted children live in rural areas. 47 Compared with their
urban counterparts, children living in rural areas of Burundi, Honduras and Mali were
twice as likely to be stunted. 48
Many urban residents experience steep inequalities in food security. Rural -tourban migration is creating “hidden cities” of extremely poor urban populations,

including over 800 million people living in slum conditions who are particularly
vulnerable to financial crises or food price hikes. For people who remain in rural and
remote areas with poor infrastructure, physical access to a healthy diversity of foods
may also be limited and compounded by climate and seasonal fluctuations that
threaten food security.
Shifts in consumption towards foods high in sugar, salt and fats are happening
fastest in urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. 49 Poor urban
residents face challenges in finding a variety of affordable, fresh and nutritious foods,
and many either live in “food deserts” where there is little or no access to food, or in
“food swamps” where there is an abundance of high-calorie, low-nutrient, processed
foods.
People experiencing food insecurity shift from nutrient-rich foods towards more
energy-dense but nutrient-poor foods. The greater affordability of highly processed,
energy-dense, low-nutrient foods is what links food insecurity with obesity, in
particular in low-income and middle-income countries where such foods are widely
available, cheaper than nutritious foods 50 and aggressively marketed (see figure II).

Security and Nutrition in the World 2018: Building climate resilience for food security and nutrition (2018).
Conflict and insecurity, climate shocks and economic turbulence are common
drivers of food insecurity, exacerbating nutritional risks and often leading to an increase
in acute malnutrition in emergencies. Women go hungry more often than men in times
of crisis, even if they are pregnant or nursing. The prevalence of stunting increases in

protracted humanitarian crises, while rates of wasting typically remain high,
indicating the need for solutions addressing both acute and long -term malnutrition.
Food insecurity also impacts human mobility and migration. 51 Countries with
the highest levels of food insecurity and armed conflict have the highest outward
migration of refugees, and food insecurity itself increases the likelihood and intensity
of armed conflicts.
A comprehensive approach is needed to prevent the deterioration of nutrition in
times of crisis and to sustain nutrition-related gains over the longer term. Conditional
cash transfers show promise in increasing vulnerable people’s access to nutritious
foods, but strategies must ensure that cash transfers are us ed to purchase nutritious
food. In Bangladesh, support provided through e-vouchers combined with nutrition
education provides a double-duty intervention that promotes healthy eating. 52
B.
Food systems, young people and demographic change
Ageing of the agricultural labour force is a trend in many parts of the world.
The global average age of farmers is now about 60, yet countries with the highest
proportions of young people also depend heavily on agriculture. The transformation
of the rural economy will influence both the scale and kinds of opportunities available
to young people, women and others facing underemployment. Constrained access to
land, finance, markets and mentoring hinders young people, in particular young
women, from securing opportunities within modern agriculture. Many local and State
programmes are therefore drawing young people into youth farmer networks,
agricultural entrepreneurship initiatives and programmes offering subsidies, credit,
mentoring and knowledge exchange among farmers of all ages.
Scarcity and inequities in the distribution of agricultural land are increasing with
rural population growth, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, confining people within
“poverty traps” on degraded lands. Population growth is linked to the shrinking size
of most smallholder farms, and can be effectively addressed by expanding access to
voluntary family planning, education for women and girls and child survival.
Some challenges are greatest for young women. Food insecurity and poverty
can lead families to resort to child, early or forced marriage to ease financial pressure,
have fewer mouths to feed and place a daughter in a more secure household. In
countries where child, early or forced marriage is already common, economi c shocks
are often accompanied by rising incidence. Young brides and their children
experience higher rates of malnutrition than those who marry later, lower levels of
educational attainment and less access to agricultural training or resources.
Agriculture programmes can target those already in early marriages to ensure that
they benefit from agricultural training opportunities, and Governments can
aggressively discourage child, early or forced marriage.
The Agrifood Youth Employment and Engagement Study indicates that expanding
investments in the sub-Saharan Africa agricultural sector will be critical to generate
higher-paying jobs in the next decade – both on and off the farm – for the large rural
youth population. 53 With an eye on sustainability, FAO and local authorities in Tanzania
introduced youth-targeted training in organic farming. Young trainees returned to their
World Food Programme, At the Root of Exodus: Food Security, Conflict and International
Migration (2017).

University, 2016).

communities, trained their peers, raised awareness of organic agriculture and found
local markets for their produce, including the booming hotel industry.
Women play important roles as producers and sellers of food, managers of natural
resources and caretakers of household nutrition and food security. Agriculture employs
per cent of the total female working population in South Asia.54 However, many
women in farming do not work their own land, but are in agricultural wage labour with
unreliable incomes, pervasive sexual harassment and poor working conditions. Gender
inequalities across the farming sector can be extreme, with women responsible for much
smallholder production but far less likely than men to have rights over land and water
resources.
Lack of data contributes to inappropriate and shallow targeting of women in
agricultural projects, which may reach women but not empo wer them. 55 Ultimately,
land ownership is crucial for women to safeguard their rights, innovate for sustainable
productivity and invest in ways that benefit children and households.
IV. Sustainability and adaptation to climate change
Progressive changes in the global food system over the past 50 years have
increased productivity, but at the cost of exacerbating land degradation, which now
directly affects 1.3 to 3.2 billion people, mostly in developing countries. Unsustainable
land management practices have increased freshwater use, biodiversity loss and
pollution, in particular in farming systems that make heavy and/or poorly managed use
of chemical pesticides, fertilizers and antibiotics. Habitat loss is degrading pollinator
services (more than 80 per cent of all crops depend on insect pollination), and land
degradation is decreasing crop yields and the nutrient density of food.
Incentives within the national or global food system can change both what is
produced and how it flows through value chains. However, government spending on
agriculture in relation to its contribution to the economy fell between 2001 and 2017.
Globally, the agriculture orientation index – the share of government expenditure to
agriculture divided by the share of gross domestic product from agriculture – fell from
42 in 2001 to 0.26 in 2017. 56
The interaction between climate change and the food system is complex. The
food system is the single largest direct and indirect driver of climate change,
contributing 21 to 37 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. In relative terms, animal
source foods are the major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for
to 66 per cent of the total food system emissions, with cattle production being the
main contributor. 57
However, climate shocks are an emerging and important determinant of food
insecurity (see figure III). In 2017, nearly 124 million people in 51 countries and
territories faced “crisis” levels of acute food insecurity, and more than three quarters
of them were also affected by climate change shocks. 57

Food and agricultural systems will need to change profoundly if humanity is to
adopt healthy diets based on food grown in ways that are sustainable and resilient in the
face of climate change. Changes are required in food production, the food environment,
and consumer behaviour.
Climate change will alter the distribution of pests and diseases affecting food
quality, and rising temperatures and water scarcity may limit the extent to which
irrigation expansion can counter climate threats to crop yields. It will be necessary to
adapt production practices to reduce soil degradation and water use, while improving
the quality of diets for better nutrition and health. Promising initiatives include plant
diversification programmes to increase soil health, crop yields and nutrient density in
farming households; and conservation agriculture and no tillage practices to optimize
crop production, retain organic matter and nutrients in the soil and offer more carbon
sequestration. 58 If farmers receive incentives, and perceive long-term benefits, many
adopt new technologies and conservation agriculture techniques, even with lower
expected short-term returns relative to conventional cropping methods.
Evidence suggests that land tenure among smallholder farmers can increase
investments in sustainability. When land rights were secured in Rwanda, investments
in soil conservation increased. 59 In Africa, where 90 per cent of land tenure is informal,
large-scale measures based on pilot experiments have been identified by the World
Bank which could leverage land tenure improvement for $4.5 billion. 60 Conditional
cash transfers can promote the adoption of more sustainable practices; in Uganda, such
transfers reduced forest cover loss. 61 Ideally, the positive effects of cash transfer

programmes continue when the payments stop, from the adoption of new practices. In
Colombia, for example, farmers who had been incentivized to adopt more sustainable
pastoral practices for four years continued to do so long after payments ended. 62
Recent developments on biofortification demonstrate the possibility to breed
more nutrient dense foods, to counter projected reductions in nutrient content due to
soil degradation. High vitamin A maize and cassava, high iron beans and zinc millet
have been bred without reduced productivity, and in some cases actually increased
productivity and disease resistance. Biofortified crops are being introduced in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia, among
other countries.
The EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health recently catalysed an
important debate on a healthy reference diet within planetary boundaries. Dietary
changes consisting of plant-based foods, such as coarse grains, legumes, fruits and
vegetables, nuts and seeds and limited animal-sourced food produced, can reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and improve public health. 63 While the overall consumption
of meat and other animal source foods strain the natural resource base, in low -income
and middle-income countries livestock-derived foods remain critical to meeting the
nutrient intakes of many pregnant and lactating women, infants and young children.
Local food systems are essential for sustainability. Reducing the global transport
emissions is challenging because the demand to move goods around the world is
growing. Comparisons between regionalized food systems (whereby urban food and
animal feed demands are fulfilled by produce from the nearest possible surroundings)
and globalized food systems (where the demands are randomly met form the global
pool of producer areas) suggest that regionalized food systems would halve the
current level of emissions from food transport, while exclusively global systems
would increase emissions by a factor of four. 64
Food waste reduction reduces greenhouse gas emissions and environmental
degradation by decreasing the land area needed for food production. Food loss and
waste contributed around 10 per cent of the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions in 2010–2016. 65 Technology and better agricultural practices can minimize
wastage by increasing the productivity of higher-value agricultural products, 66 and
better storage and distribution infrastructure, reducing post-harvest losses.
Finally, recent policy recommendations for food security in the con text of
climate change emphasize the need for Governments and development actors to
respond more holistically to the long-term health of agriculture, in the light of climate
change. Multi-sector partnerships can promote integrated planning and policy
choices. New research and innovations are needed to adapt agricultural practices to
climate change, but many interventions are available for Governments to review,
adopt and test at scale.

V. Recommendations
Member States are called upon to recognize that, with six years remaining in
the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, accelerated action is required
to achieve the global goals of eradicating hunger and preventing malnutrition in
all its forms, and Governments should capitalize on a wide range of readily
available, well-proven and cost-effective nutrition interventions and scale up
implementation.
Governments and development partners are encouraged to make the
necessary commitments to assure universal nutrition support for all pregnant
women, mother-infant dyads and schoolchildren in all contexts, and to adopt
policies that protect, promote and support breastfeeding.
Governments are encouraged to recognize the special nutritional needs
among young pregnant women and to take steps to interrupt the
intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty by ending child marriage,
discouraging early childbearing and ensuring that all young women have the
opportunity to grow into adulthood before starting a family.
Governments and development partners are encouraged to mainstream
nutrition in national health-care systems and improve nutrition training among
health workers.
Member States are encouraged to urgently address the rise of unhealthy
eating and the corresponding epidemic of overweight and obesity, and to
generate and share knowledge on the impact of different interventions, including
behaviour change communication, fiscal and regulatory measures, public
procurement of nutritious foods, better nourishment in public institutions and
restrictions on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children,
among others.
Member States are encouraged to support social protection and humanitarian
programmes aimed at ensuring food security and nutrition for highly vulnerable
populations, including those enduring humanitarian crises, climate or economic
shocks.
Member States are called upon to transform food systems using climate-smart
and sustainable agricultural practices that simultaneously promote biodiversity,
sustainable agriculture and nutrient density. Wherever possible, nutrition
intervention programmes should promote local sustainable food production.
Member States are encouraged to take measures to work on a
comprehensive, binding treaty to regulate hazardous pesticide use worldwide and
to phase out the use of antimicrobials for animal growth promotion, consistent
with guidance from the Tripartite agencies (FAO, World Organization for Animal
Health and WHO) and the Codex Alimentarius.
Without investments in knowledge, it is not possible to build an effective
global investment case for achieving the requisite transformation of food systems
for sustainable agriculture, a prerequisite for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal 2. Member States are encouraged to prioritize, support and
share critical areas of research on improving nutrition and sustainable
agriculture through a food systems lens and on improving surveillance and the
evaluation of national trials and innovative practices, and to expand the global
knowledge sector on scalable strategies for delivering nutrition and food security
for all.

World demographic trends
Report of the Secretary-General
Summary
The present report, prepared in accordance with resolution 1996/2 of the
Economic and Social Council, provides an overview of demographic trends for the
world, its regions and selected countries. The report documents four demographic
megatrends – population growth, population ageing, urbanization and international
migration – which are highly relevant to the achievement of the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals. It focuses on recent demographic changes, as well as projected
trends over the next few decades.
In 2019, the world’s population numbered 7.7 billion. Projection s of future trends
suggest that the world’s population is likely to continue growing in future decades, but
at a progressively slower pace. Globally, growth could stabilize at a level of roughly
9 billion people by the end of the century. As growth in its size continues, the global
population will continue its gradual shift towards a growing proportion of older
persons (population ageing) and living in cities (urbanization), while maintaining or
further increasing current levels of cross-border mobility (international migration).
Ending poverty and hunger, reducing inequality and ensuring a healthy and
productive future for all are key challenges on the path towards sustainable
development. The human population continues to grow rapidly, especially in c ountries
facing the greatest challenges in achieving the global development goals and ensuring
that no one is left behind. In countries with large and growing youth populations,
creating enough decent jobs and ensuring sustained and inclusive economic grow th
will remain top priorities. Investments in education and health care, including for
reproductive health and family planning, help both to raise levels of human
development and to promote a lower birth rate, two preconditions for realizing a
“demographic dividend”.

The continuing growth of both the human population and per capita consumption
underlines the importance of ensuring sustainable patterns of consumption and
production, while also meeting the basic and immediate needs of a growing population,
including access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all. More broadly, since
population patterns and trends interact in multiple and critical ways with all aspects of
sustainable development, a fuller integration of population dynamics into development
planning and review processes will assist countries in achieving the Goals and targets
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

I. Introduction
The present report documents four demographic megatrends – population
growth, population ageing, urbanization and international migration – which are
highly relevant to the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. While
the four megatrends apply to the world’s population as a whole, there is a considerable
diversity of demographic patterns and trends across countries and regions, and across
development and income groups, depending especially on levels and trends in birth
rates.
In 2019, the world’s population numbered 7.7 billion and was projected to grow
to around 8.5 billion in 2030. Most of the growth between 2019 and 2030 is expected
to occur in sub-Saharan Africa and in Central and Southern Asia, where the population
will increase by around 0.3 billion and 0.2 billion, respectively. A population of
7 billion is projected for 2050. Globally, growth could stabilize at a level of roughly
9 billion people by the end of the century. Although a gradual slowdown in the
global rate of increase is anticipated, rapid population growth continues at present,
especially in countries facing the greatest challenges in achieving the global
development goals and ensuring that no one is left behind. The continuing growth of
both the human population and per capita consumption underlines the importance of
ensuring sustainable patterns of consumption and production, while also meeting the
basic and immediate needs of a growing population, including access to safe,
nutritious and sufficient food for all.
Population ageing is a worldwide phenomenon driven by declining birth rates
and, to a lesser extent, by increasing longevity. Some countries are still in an early
phase of the demographic transition, with relatively high levels of fertility and large
proportions of children and youth, while in other countries the number of older
persons has grown rapidly, shifting the balance of the population from younger to
older age groups. The changing age structure of the human population has major
implications in the short run for labour market dynamics and in the long run for the
financial sustainability of social security, health-care and pension systems. In the
intermediate stages of the demographic transition, when rates of both mortality and
fertility are declining, a rising share of the working-age population has the potential
to generate a “demographic dividend”, which depends also on prior investments in
education and health. At more advanced stages of population ageing, the reduced
share of the population in the working age range puts pressure on support systems for
the older population (see E/CN.9/2017/2).
Urbanization is an important driver of economic growth and human
development. Cities concentrate economic activities and innovations, and they
provide infrastructure and social services beyond the urban areas themselves. More
than half of the world’s people live in urban areas, and projections indicate that all of
the anticipated growth of the human population between now and 2050 will be
accounted for by the growth of the population residing in urban areas. In many
regions, the share of the population living in cities, as well as the number and size of
cities, will continue to grow, driven by a combination of factors, including a surplus
of births relative to deaths occurring in urban areas, migration from rural to urban
areas of the same country, urban reclassification of formerly rural areas and migration
from other countries. Many cities attract considerable numbers of international
migrants and play an important role in their integration into the host society.
Population growth and urbanization are also transforming the lives of those living in
the rural areas around cities. The linkages between cities and rural areas are
instrumental, for example, in shaping sustainable food systems for a growing global
population (see E/CN.9/2018/2).

International migration continues to increase globally and to affect the
demographics and other characteristics of origin and destination countries. Since
migration is selective in terms of age, sex, level of education an d other factors, it can
also affect trends in employment and other aspects of sustainable development. In
countries with ageing populations and an excess of deaths over births, international
migration can have a significant impact on the working-age population and economic
growth. The multiple impacts of international migration are of major importance for
the development of countries of origin, transit and destination and require adequate
policy responses so that migrants can make better lives for themselve s and their
families, while also contributing to the economic and social development of both host
societies and, potentially, communities of origin (see E/CN.9/2018/2).
The demographic trends highlighted in the present report are provided for the
world, for major geographical regions, 1 and for development and income groups. The
report is based mainly on data contained in World Population Prospects 2019, the
twenty-sixth edition of the United Nations estimates and projections of global
population, prepared every two years by the Population Division of the Department
of Economic and Social Affairs. The report also draws on other data sets created and
maintained by the Population Division. Data on urbanization and on the size and
growth of cities are from World Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision. Data on
the number and characteristics of international migrants, including refugees, are from
the International Migrant Stock 2019 data set. Data about contr aceptive use and the
unmet need for family planning are from the World Contraceptive Use 2019 and
Estimates and Projections of Family Planning Indicators 2019 data sets.
II. Population growth
In 2019, the world’s population reached an estimated 7.7 billion, and it is
expected to grow to about 10.9 billion in 2100 (see table 1). Currently, the global
population is growing at 1.1 per cent per year and thus increased by some 82 million
people in 2019. The global growth rate is expected to decline to about 0.5 per cent by
2050, driven by a continuing decline in levels of fertility. By 2100, it is expected that
the growth rate of the global population will be very close to zero.
In preparing the analysis for the present report, countries and areas were grouped into eight
regions based on the classification being used to track progress towards the Sustainable
Development Goals (see https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/regional-groups/). The eight
regions are as follows: (a) sub-Saharan Africa; (b) Northern Africa and Western Asia; (c) Central
and Southern Asia; (d) Eastern and South-Eastern Asia; (e) Latin America and the Caribbean;
Australia and New Zealand; (g) Oceania, excluding Australia and New Zealand; and
Europe and Northern America. These regional groupings are used throughout the present
report with a small number of exceptions, which are clearly noted.

Medium variant.
The estimates and projections of global population by the United Nations are
revised every two years, taking into account the most recent data for each country or
area. The 2019 estimates of population trends in recent decades follow closely the
projected trends of earlier editions. Yet all population projections have an inherent
degree of uncertainty, which increases as the projection interval grows longer. To
account for the uncertainty, statistical simulations were performed using a statistical
model of demographic change over time, yielding a range of plausible future trends
in fertility, mortality, population size and other characteristics. The median of the
range of simulated future trends was taken as the most likely trajectory a nd is known
as the “medium variant” of the official projections presented in World Population
Prospects 2019 (see figure I).
Derived from an analysis of past trends, the medium variant assumes a
continued decline in fertility levels for countries where the number of births per
woman is still relatively high. For countries and areas where fertility has fallen below
two births per woman, the statistical model allows for a modest increase in the future,
but only if such a trend has been confirmed by recent data. Similarly, for these
projections, it is assumed that life expectancy at birth will continue to rise throughout
the world, based on the observation of an ongoing and persistent reduction of
mortality rates for almost all countries. 2

E/CN.9/2020/5
The uncertainty of the United Nations population projections is described by
prediction intervals resulting from the statistical simulation of future trends
mentioned previously. The intervals indicate, with a likelihood of 95 per cent, that the
global population will be between 8.5 billion and 8.6 billion in 2030, between
4 billion and 10.1 billion in 2050, and between 9.4 billion and 12.7 billion in 2100
(see figure I). Thus, it seems likely that the world’s population will continue to grow
throughout the present century. The growth will decelerate gradually over the next
few decades and is expected to come to an end around 2100.
Figure I
Projected future trends of world population, with prediction intervals of 80 and
per cent, 1950–2100
Trends in population size are projected to take divergent paths across countries
and regions. Future growth will be concentrated in certain regions. The population of
sub-Saharan Africa, the fastest growing region, is projected to double between 2019
and 2050, increasing by 1.1 billion people (see table 1). The projected growth in
Central and Southern Asia will add 0.5 billion to a population of 2.5 billion by 2050.
The population of Northern Africa and Western Asia is projected to increase by
2 billion by 2050, while the populations of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and of
Latin America and the Caribbean are both expected to grow by 0.1 billion between
and 2050. Those five regions will account for almost all global growth over the
next three decades. Meanwhile, the population of Oceania, including Australia and
New Zealand, is projected to increase by just 15 million between now and 2050, while
Europe and Northern America combined may add around 22 million people. As a
direct result of these trends, the proportion of the global population living in
sub-Saharan Africa is expected to increase from 14 per cent in 2019 to 22 per cent in
At the same time, the share of the global population living in Eastern and South Eastern Asia is projected to fall from 30 to 25 per cent, while the share living in
Europe and Northern America could decline from 14 to 12 per cent. Other regions are
expected to see smaller changes in their share of the world’s population over the same
period (see figure II).

E/CN.9/2020/5
Figure II
World population by region, 1970–2100
While the population of high-income countries 3 is projected to grow only
slightly in future decades, rising from 1.26 billion in 2019 to 1.32 billion in 2050,
over the same period, the population of middle-income countries will grow by more
than one fifth, from 5.7 billion to 6.9 billion, and low -income countries will see their
combined population almost double, rising from 0.8 billion to 1.5 billion. The total
population of the least developed countries will rise from 1 billion in 2019 to
9 billion in 2050. Thus, it is expected that the world’s fastest population growth
over the next three decades will occur in countries facing the greatest challenges in
ending poverty and hunger and in ensuring healthy lives, high-quality education,
inclusivity and equality for all (see table 1).
III. Fertility and family planning
The level of total fertility for the world as a whole declined from an average of
5 live births per woman during the period 1970 –1975 to 2.5 live births per woman
during the period 2015–2020. Globally, total fertility is projected to continue to
decline and may reach 2.2 live births per woman in the period 2045–2050 (see figure III).
In the period 2015–2020, sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Africa and Western Asia, and
Oceania 4 had levels of total fertility above the global average of 2.5 live births per
woman, while all other regions fell below the global value. In Australia and New
Zealand, in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, in Europe and Northern America, and in
Latin America and the Caribbean, total fertility in recent years has been below the
threshold of 2.1 live births per woman that is required in low -mortality settings to
ensure replacement of the population over time (the “replacement level”). On the

Australia and New Zealand, which are treated here as a separate region.

other hand, 36 countries had total fertility levels of 4.0 or mo re live births per woman
in 2019, of which 33 are in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of their high fertility levels,
these countries are growing much faster than the global average and have large
proportions of children and youth.
Figure III
Total fertility rate, for the world and by region, 1970–1975 to 2045–2050
Fertility contributes to population growth in the long run when it is above the
replacement level and to population decline when it lies below that level. However,
even if fertility falls immediately to the replacement level or below in a given
population, there will be a period of continued growth due to current and future
childbearing among relatively large cohorts at younger ages, including in the age
range when childbearing typically occurs. This characteristic of demographic growth,
known as “population momentum”, limits the potential impact of changes in the
fertility level on population trends over the next few decades.
Since the 1970s, an increasing number of countries have reached fertility levels
below the replacement threshold of around 2.1 births per woman. Some countries
have remained below the threshold for several decades. In 1970, about 16 per cent of
the world’s population, including nearly all of Europe and Norther n America, lived in
a country with fertility below the replacement level. In 2019, almost one half of the
world’s population lived in 1 of the 94 countries with fertility in this range. Sustained
below-replacement fertility is increasingly regarded as a challenge by national
Governments because it accelerates the pace of population ageing and leads to
population decline in the long run.
Between 1990 and 2019, the prevalence of contraceptive use among women
aged between 15 and 49 years grew from 42 per cent to nearly 49 per cent, while the
number of women using any method of contraception increased from 554 million to
million. Owing to the increasing availability of family planning services and
information, a growing number of women and men have been able to enjoy the right
to decide, freely and responsibly, the number and timing of any children that they
may wish to have. Increased levels of contraceptive use, however, have not led to a
decline in the number of women with an unmet need for family pla nning – those who
8/23
20-00645
E/CN.9/2020/5
wish to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any method of contraception to
prevent pregnancy. Indeed, even though the proportion of women aged between
and 49 years with an unmet need for family planning declined between 1990 a nd
2019, from over 11 per cent to about 10 per cent, the number of women with an unmet
need for family planning increased from 151 million to 190 million. In sub -Saharan
Africa, the region with the highest levels of fertility, as many as one in six women
between the ages of 15 and 49 years have an unmet need for family planning.
Worldwide, the proportion of women whose need for family planning was
satisfied with modern contraceptive methods (Sustainable Development Goal
indicator 3.7.1) increased from 67 per cent in 1990 to 76 per cent in 2019 (see
figure IV). Across regions, the demand satisfied by modern methods in 2019 was by
far the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa and in Oceania, where the use of modern
contraceptive methods among women who wish to prevent pregnancy remained low,
at 54.7 per cent and 51.1 per cent, respectively. In addition, the proportion of the need
for family planning satisfied by modern methods was below the world average in
Northern Africa and Western Asia (63 per cent) and in Central and Southern Asia
(68 per cent). In 2019, less than half of the total need for family planning was being
met with modern methods in 42 countries, including 23 in sub -Saharan Africa. In an
additional 69 countries, more than half but less than three quarters of the total demand
was being met by the use of modern methods.
Early marriage, early childbearing and unwanted pregnancies often have
adverse social and economic consequences for girls and young women, as well as
posing health risks to both mother and child. Early marriage is an important predictor
and determinant of early childbearing. One positive development in recent decades is
that the proportion of young women between 15 and 19 years of age who are married
or in a cohabiting union has decreased in most countries. 5 However, among women
in this age range, complications of pregnancy and childbirth remain the leading cause
of death globally. 6 To counter these risks, adolescents need access to sexual and
reproductive health-care services designed to meet their specific needs.

Investment in the education of girls, the reduction or elimination of early
marriages and expanded access to information, education and services in the area of
sexual and reproductive health remain priority actions to support a continued decline
in adolescent fertility. The global adolescent birth rate was 65 births annually per
1,000 women aged between 15 and 19 years in the early 1990s, but it declined to
births per 1,000 women in the period 2015–2020. A further decline to 31 births per
1,000 women is projected for the period 2045–2050 (see figure V). In Latin America
and the Caribbean, the adolescent birth rate has also declined significantly, but it
remained relatively high in the period 2015–2020, at 63 births per 1,000 women; it is
projected to decline to 40 births per 1,000 women in the period 2045 –2050.
Adolescent fertility is expected to remain high in sub-Saharan Africa, as well, where
countries had an adolescent birth rate above 100 births per 1,000 women in the
period 2015–2020 and 26 countries are projected to have a rate above 50 births per
1,000 women in the period 2045–2050. In contrast, for other regions, except Oceania,
the adolescent birth rate was below 50 births per 1,000 women in the period
2015-2020, and it is projected to drop below 30 births per 1,000 women by
2045-2050.

Between the period 1970–1975 and the period 2015–2020, global life
expectancy at birth rose by 14.2 years – from 58.1 years to 72.3 years – and it is
projected to increase further to 76.8 years in the period 2045 –2050 (see figure VI).
By the end of the century, global life expectancy at birth is likely to exceed 82 years.
In the period 2015–2020, the life expectancy of women at birth was 74.7 years, while
that of men was 4.8 years lower, at 69.9 years. The difference in life expectancy at
birth between sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia and New Zealand, the regions with
the lowest and highest life expectancies, respectively, decreased from 27 years in the
period 1970–1975 to 22 years in the period 2015–2020, and it is expected to fall to
years in the period 2045–2050.

Figure VI
Life expectancy at birth, for the world and by region, from 1970–1975
to 2045–2050
In the period 2015–2020, life expectancy at birth reached 80.3 years in the highincome countries and areas as a whole. Thirty-two countries or areas, mostly in
Europe, had a life expectancy of more than 80 years. The highest life expectancy at
birth for a national population was recorded for Japan (83.3 years). However,
countries, including some of the world’s poorest, have still not reached a life
expectancy of 60 years. Life expectancy at birth for the least developed countries as
a group was 62.4 years, on average, in the period 2015 –2020.
For the countries that are heavily affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, most ly
in sub-Saharan Africa, the increase in life expectancy at birth since the 1950s was
followed by a decrease during the 1980s and 1990s. Life expectancy in that region
had reached 49.6 years in the period 1985–1990 but then fell to 49.1 years in the
period 1990–1995, followed by small increases until the period 2000–2005. In recent
years, some of the losses in longevity due to HIV/AIDS have been reversed, and
sub-Saharan Africa achieved a life expectancy at birth of 57.8 years in the period
2015–2020.
In many countries, including many low-income countries, causes of death have
shifted from a predominance of communicable diseases to a predominance of
non-communicable diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, which are
linked to lifestyle choices, including consumption of tobacco and alcohol, unhealthy
diets with high shares of processed foods and lack of physical activity. A growing
percentage of the global population, including many children, is affected by
overweight and obesity, and the prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. At
the same time, after decades of success in combating poverty and hunger,
undernourishment has been on the rise again in recent years. Some countries are still
struggling in the fight against communicable diseases, such as malaria and
tuberculosis, which affect poor populations disproportionately. When mothers are
malnourished, the risks of both maternal and child mortality are greater, while the

health and nutritional status of children influence their suscep tibility to adverse health
conditions later in life (see E/CN.9/2020/2).
High levels of infant and child mortality are due largely to the high incidence and
fatality of communicable diseases at younger ages. Progress in reducing infant and child
mortality from these diseases depends mostly on improvements in living conditions,
sanitation and nutrition, and on access to health technologies, such as vaccines, that
protect against mortality from infections and malnutrition. The under-5 mortality rate –
the probability of dying between birth and a child’s fifth birthday – declined worldwide
from 91 deaths per 1,000 live births in the period 1990–1995 to 46 deaths per 1,000 live
births in the period 2015–2020 (see figure VII). Over the same period, the largest
absolute reduction in under-5 mortality was recorded in sub-Saharan Africa, where the
rate declined from 183 to 93 deaths per 1,000 live births, followed by Central and
Southern Asia, from 115 to 52; Northern Africa and Western Asia, from 71 to 31;
Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, from 53 to 20; Latin America and the Caribbean, from
to 21; Oceania, from 69 to 52; Europe and Northern America, from 13 to 6; and
Australia and New Zealand, from 8 to 4.
Sustainable Development Goal target 3.2 calls for a level of under-5 mortality in
of no more than 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. Australia and New Zealand,
Europe and Northern America, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Latin America and
the Caribbean had already reached this target by the period 2015–2020, for each region
as a whole (see figure VII). In addition, the region of Northern Africa and Western Asia
is expected to meet target 3.2 by 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Southern Asia,
and Oceania, however, seem unlikely to meet the target if future trends resemble those
of recent years. Globally, there are 55 countries, including 41 in sub-Saharan Africa,
in Northern Africa and Western Asia, 4 in Central and Southern Asia, 3 in Eastern a nd
South-Eastern Asia, 3 in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 2 in Oceania, where
target 3.2 is unlikely to be achieved by 2030 if current trends continue, suggesting the
need for significant additional resources and effort to obtain the desired result.

Sustainable Development Goal target 3.1 calls for a reduction in the global
maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by
From 2000 to 2017, the global maternal mortality ratio fell by 38 per cent, to
deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017 (see figure VIII). The number of maternal
deaths declined from an estimated 452,172 in 2000 to 295,925 in 2017. All developing
regions experienced substantial reductions in maternal mortality between 2000 and
However, in 2017, the maternal mortality ratio remained above 500 maternal
deaths per 100,000 live births in sub-Saharan Africa and above 100 deaths per
100,000 live births in Central and Southern Asia and in Oceania. If target 3.1 is to be
achieved globally by 2030, the pace of reducing the maternal mortality ratio will need
to be accelerated. According to recent projections, achieving this global goal will
require countries to reduce their maternal mortality ratios by at least 6.1 per cent each
year between 2016 and 2030. Between 2000 and 2017, only 16 countries (Angola,
Belarus, Cambodia, Estonia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, Lao People ’s
Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation,
Rwanda, Tajikistan, Timor-Leste and Turkmenistan) experienced reductions in the
maternal mortality ratio at this pace or faster. 7
Once life expectancy at birth has reached 70 years or more, further substantial
increases require reductions in mortality at older ages, as measured by increased
levels of life expectancy at age 60. Globally, the average person turning 60 in the
period 2015–2020 could expect to live another 20.7 years. This indicator is projected
to rise to 22.9 years in the period 2045–2050. Yet there is wide variation across
regions in life expectancy at age 60, ranging from about 16 years in Oceania and
sub-Saharan Africa to 25.6 years in Australia and New Zealan d. Further increases in
survival at older ages will depend mainly on the ability to control the impact of
non-communicable diseases, which will become even more challenging as the global
population continues to grow older.

V. Changing population age structures
Population ageing is a global trend with major social and economic
consequences that is characterized by a gradual upward shift over many decades in
the population age distribution, resulting in a larger proportion of the population at
older ages and a smaller share at younger ages. The pace of population ageing is
determined mainly by the speed and magnitude of the decline in fertility and, to a
lesser extent, by the reduction in mortality at older ages. Although international
migration also affects the age structure of origin and destination countries, the size of
the effect, which depends on the number and age distri bution of migrants compared
with the populations involved, tends to be much smaller than the impact of changes
over time in fertility and mortality.
Population ageing can be examined by tracking trends in the age distribution of
the population. In 2019, about 57 per cent of the world’s population was between the
ages of 20 and 64 (see figure IX), while about 34 per cent was under the age of 20
and 9 per cent was aged 65 years or older (henceforth, “older persons”). The share of
the working-age population was highest in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and lowest
in sub-Saharan Africa. The number of persons under 20 years of age is projected to
remain stable at slightly above 2.5 billion between 2019 and 2050, while the number
of older persons may increase from 703 million in 2019 to 1.5 billion in 2050.
Globally, the share of the population between 20 and 64 years of age is expected to
fall slightly, to 56 per cent in 2050, but it will increase in absolute numbers from
4 billion in 2019 to 5.5 billion in 2050. Differences across regions in the share of
the working-age population are expected to decrease significantly by 2050. A large
part of the increased share of persons aged 65 years and over is attributable to the
increased share of persons aged 80 years and over, which is expected to increase from
9 to 4.4 per cent of the total population worldwide between 2019 and 2050;
throughout the world, this age group is growing faster than any younger age group.

the world and by region, 1980–2050

E/CN.9/2020/5
Population ageing started at different times and is proceeding at varying speeds
across countries and regions. Trends in the share of persons under 20 years o f age
compared with the share of those aged 65 or over reflect the different stages of the
ageing process by region (see figure X). Europe and Northern America, and Australia
and New Zealand had the world’s highest shares of those aged 65 years or over in
2019, and in Europe and Northern America, the share of persons below 20 years of
age was close to reaching that of older persons in 2019. Australia and New Zealand,
and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia are projected to follow suit over the next few
decades, with the share of older persons expected to exceed that of persons under
years of age by 2050. In sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, the share of persons
below 20 years of age is expected to decrease to 43 per cent in 2050, while the share
of older persons will remain below 5 per cent.
When fertility falls and the number of births declines, the immediate effect is a
reduction in the proportion of children and a consequent rise in the proportion of the
population at ages beyond childhood. Following a substantial reduction in fertility
levels, the share of the working-age population typically increases for several
decades, but eventually it begins to decline as population ageing becomes more
pronounced. During the intervening period, the expansion in the share of the workingage population provides an opportunity for rapid per capita economic growth, known
as a “demographic dividend”. Realizing that dividend requires the availability of
productive jobs for the growing number of persons of working age. Dur ing this
demographic window of opportunity, policies to support sustained and inclusive
economic growth, promote decent work for all, and expand investments in health and
education, in keeping with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, can
increase labour productivity and further accelerate the growth of per capita income.

While the percentage of the global population between 20 and 64 years of age
is expected to remain stable at between 63 and 65 per cent, the share of the working 16/23
20-00645
E/CN.9/2020/5
age population is expected to be significantly higher in 2050 than today in three regions:
sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, and Central and Southern Asia. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, and in Northern Africa and Western Asia, the share of the working -age
population is expected to remain stable. In all other regions, it is expected to continue
to decline over the next three decades.
In countries with ageing populations and more deaths than births, migration can
slow or counter trends of population decline. Indeed, between 2010 and 2020, in
countries (Belarus, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Russian Federation,
Serbia and Ukraine), a net inflow of migrants helped to offset an excess of deaths
over births. However, in 10 other countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova and
Romania), a net outflow of international migrants added to th e impact of an excess of
deaths over births. 8 Among the regions, the greatest contribution of international
migration to population growth between 2015 and 2020 occurred in Australia and
New Zealand, while the largest outmigration per 1,000 population occu rred in other
parts of Oceania (see figure XI). It is projected that international migration will have
an increasing impact on future population size in some regions. During the period
2045–2050, international migration is expected to have a relatively large impact on
population size and age structure in Europe and Northern America, Australia and New
Zealand and Central and Southern Asia. Since international migrants are generally
younger than the population of destination countries, international migration helps to
postpone the ageing of destination countries. Nevertheless, the demographic impacts
of international migration are not large enough to halt or reverse the long -term trend
towards population ageing caused by the historical rise in life expectancy at birth and
the subsequent decline in fertility.

VI. Urbanization and city growth
In 2019, an estimated 56 per cent of people worldwide lived in urban areas.
Projections indicate that almost all of the growth in world population in the coming
decades will be reflected in an increased number of urban dwellers. By 2030, the
share of the world’s population living in urban areas is expected to re ach 60 per cent,
and in 2050, around two thirds of the global population (68 per cent) may be living
in urban areas, compared with roughly one third in 1950. Currently, the most
urbanized region is Australia and New Zealand at 86 per cent, followed by Lati n
America and the Caribbean at 81 per cent, Europe and Northern America at 77 per
cent, Northern Africa and Western Asia at 62 per cent, and Eastern and South -Eastern
Asia at 58 per cent (see figure XII). In 2019, less than half of the population was
living in urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa (41 per cent), Central and Southern Asia
(36 per cent) and Oceania (22 per cent). However, these regions are urbanizing
rapidly. In 2030, it is projected that urban settlements will be home to 47 per cent of
the population in sub-Saharan Africa, 42 per cent in Central and Southern Asia and
per cent in Oceania. By 2030, the share of the urban population is expected to rise
to 88 per cent in Australia and New Zealand, 84 per cent in Latin America and the
Caribbean, 80 per cent in Europe and Northern America, 68 per cent in Eastern and
South-Eastern Asia, and 66 per cent in Northern Africa and Western Asia.
Figure XII
Urban population as a percentage of total population, for the world and by
region, 1950–2050
As the urban population has grown worldwide, so too have the number of cities
and the size of city populations. The number of cities with more than 10 million
inhabitants – often called “megacities” – grew from just 10 in 1990 to 33 in 2019 and
is projected to rise to 43 in 2030. All megacities that are expected to emerge by 2030
are found in the less developed regions. Urban growth is driven by growth in cities of
all sizes. The number of large cities (between 5 million and 10 million inh abitants)
increased from 21 in 1990 to 50 in 2019 and is expected to rise further to 66 in 2030.
The number of medium-sized cities (between 1 million and 5 million) and of smaller
18/23
20-00645
E/CN.9/2020/5
cities (fewer than 1 million) is increasing, as well, especially in the less developed
regions.
Urbanization is driven, in part, by migration from rural areas, whose residents
move to cities in search of jobs and other opportunities. In addition, an excess of
births over deaths in urban areas is an important component of popul ation growth in
many cities, particularly in parts of the less developed regions where fertility remains
high. Reclassification of rural areas as urban is a third factor contributing to urban
increase. Rapid and unplanned urban growth present challenges fo r sustainable
development in the form of urban sprawl, pollution and environmental degradation.
Government policies for planning and managing urban growth can help to mitigate
these negative effects and should be aimed at sustainability and a more equitabl e
sharing of the benefits of urbanization.
Urbanization has generally been a positive force for economic growth and
human development. Cities are places where entrepreneurship and technological
innovation can thrive. Urban areas also serve as hubs whe re the proximity of
commerce, government and transportation provide the infrastructure necessary for
sharing knowledge and information. Sustainable urbanization requires that cities
generate adequate income and employment opportunities, provide infrastruct ure,
ensure equitable access to housing and basic services, such as education and health
care, minimize the number of people living in slums and preserve natural resources.
Cities enjoy greater economies of scale than rural areas and can more efficiently
provide infrastructure and services to serve the needs of large populations. With
careful planning and sound management, cities have the potential to be economically
and environmentally sustainable. Moreover, the linkages that cities and small towns
establish with surrounding rural areas facilitate service delivery and infrastructure
improvements in those areas.
VII. International migration
The number of international migrants – persons currently living outside their
country of birth 9 – has continued to grow in recent years. Worldwide, the number of
international migrants reached an unprecedented 272 million in 2019, up from
million in 2015, 221 million in 2010 and 174 million in 2000. The average annual
rate of growth in the number of international migrants increased from 2.0 per cent
during the period 2000–2005 to 2.8 per cent in the period 2005–2010, but then it
dropped to 2.4 per cent in the period 2010–2015 and 2.2 per cent during the period
2015–2019.
Between 2000 and 2019, the number of international migrants grew by about
million. From the perspective of migrant destinations, the largest component of
this increase was for Northern Africa and Western Asia, where the number of
international migrants rose from 20.3 million in 2000 to 4 8.6 million in 2019. Over
the same interval, the migrant population also grew rapidly in Europe, from 56.9 million
to 82.3 million, and in Northern America, from 40.3 million to 58.6 million.
The region of origin that contributed the most to the growth in the number of
international migrants was Central and Southern Asia, with the number of their
nationals living abroad increasing by 19 million, or 62 per cent, between 2000 and
The increase was also significant for the diasporas of migrants from countries
of Northern Africa and Western Asia (17.0 million), Eastern and South -Eastern Asia
(15.8 million), and Latin American and the Caribbean (15.7 million).

At the end of 2017, the total number of refugees and asylum seekers in the world
reached an estimated 28.7 million (representing about 11 per cent of all international
migrants), up from 24.7 million in mid-2015. Nearly 83 per cent of the world’s
refugees and asylum seekers were hosted by countries in the developing regions.
Turkey hosted the largest number, with around 3.8 million persons. The second largest
country of asylum was Jordan (around 2.9 million), followed by the State of Palestine
(2.2 million), Lebanon (1.6 million), Germany (1.4 million) and Pakistan
(1.4 million). The main countries of origin of refugees and asylum seekers were the
Syrian Arab Republic (6.5 million), the State of Palestine (5.9 million), Afghanistan
(3.0 million), South Sudan (2.4 million) and Myanmar (1.2 million). 10
Overall, about 42 per cent of international migrants in 2019 resided in countries
of the region in which they were born. Most international migrants born in Europe
(69 per cent), sub-Saharan Africa (65 per cent), Northern Africa and Western Asia
(51 per cent) and Oceania (50 per cent) were living in another country of the same
region in 2019 (see figure XIII). Conversely, most international migrants from Latin
America and the Caribbean (80 per cent), Central and Southern Asia (77 per cent),
Northern America (70 per cent) and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (61 per cent)
were residing outside their region of birth.

VIII. Conclusions
The world’s population reached 7.7 billion in 2019. Global population growth,
currently at a rate of 1.1 per cent per year, is expected to slow in the coming decades,
reaching zero growth around the end of the century. Because it affects the scale of
human consumption and production, global population growth will continue to pose
a challenge to sustainable development. Countries are also facing diverse challenges
and opportunities in connection with the other demographic megatrends (population
ageing, urbanization and international migration).
The global population may peak at close to 11 billion around the end of the
century. Population growth over the coming years will increase the effort required to
achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth (Sustainable Development Goal 8),
eliminate poverty and hunger (Goals 1 and 2), ensure healthy lives and quality
20-00645
21/23
E/CN.9/2020/5
education (Goals 3 and 4), achieve gender equality (Goal 5) and ensure access to
water, sanitation and modern energy for all (Goals 6 and 7).
Recognizing that people, and thus populations, are at the centre of sustainable
development, a fuller integration of population dynamics into development planning
and review processes will assist countries in achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals and targets by 2030. Most of the population increase in future decades will take
place in the 47 least developed countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the
challenges of ending poverty and hunger and ensuring access to health care, education
and equal opportunity for all are the greatest.
The number of persons added to the global population every year, currently
about 82 million, will decline slowly in future years. By 2030, the annual increase in
the world’s population will be close to 71 million, and by 2050, about 48 million.
Together with other factors of demand, future population growth will influence the
required increase in global food production. Keeping up with rising demand will
require significant changes in current practices, and it will be easier to meet the future
demand sustainably if population growth decelerates.
Significant progress has been made since the 1994 International Conferen ce on
Population and Development in reducing the unmet need for family planning,
although large disparities between and within countries remain. Increased investment
will be needed to ensure that universal access to sexual and reproductive health -care
services and information, including for family planning, is well integrated into
national plans to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
High fertility has become an exception, as the global fertility level has declined
to 2.5 live births per woman in recent decades. However, many countries still have
fertility levels higher than 4.0 births per woman, resulting in rapid population growth
and a relatively youthful population. These countries face a special challenge to invest
in education, health and access to other basic services for a growing population and to
generate sufficient productive employment for an increasing number of young people.
Countries and regions at intermediate stages of the demographic transition may
benefit from a shift in the population age distribution resulting from recent declines
in fertility. An increased concentration of the working-age population offers the
possibility of accelerated per capita economic growth. However, the window of
opportunity for reaping this “demographic dividend” lasts for only a few decades.
In Europe, Northern America and parts of Eastern Asia, where the demographic
transition was completed earlier, countries are now facing the challenges of an ageing
population. Countries with sustained below-replacement fertility levels have much
older population age structures. Without an increase in levels of fertility or
immigration, they will eventually experience a decrease in population size.
The ongoing rise in life expectancy at birth is expected to continue until the end
of the present century. By the period 2045–2050, global life expectancy could be
almost four years higher than it is today. Countries with high levels of mortality at
present are expected to experience above-average gains in life expectancy in the
future. For such countries, a continued rise in life expectancy at birth will require
further substantial reductions in child and maternal mortality to be achieved, while
also addressing hunger and malnutrition, reducing the burden of major communicable
diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and reducing premature
mortality from non-communicable diseases linked to unhealthy lifestyles.
The process of urbanization is expected to continue, and by 2050, around two
thirds of the global population is expected to live in urban areas. Making cities and
all human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable (Goal 11) contributes
to improving the quality of life for all. Urbanization has generally been a po sitive
22/23
20-00645
E/CN.9/2020/5
force for economic growth and human development, and it will be vital for providing
employment opportunities and access to services for a growing global population.
When properly managed, urbanization can help in combating poverty, inequality and
environmental degradation.
Governments have increasingly recognized the contribution of international
migration to sustainable development and have agreed on the importance of
international cooperation to facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration, w ith full
respect for human rights and humane treatment of all migrants, refugees and displaced
persons. The increasing numbers of international migrants in recent years, including
refugees and asylum seekers, have drawn attention to the issues and increase d the
priority given to international migration on the global agenda. The Global Compact
for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the global compact on refugees, both
adopted in December 2018, lay a foundation for national action and international
cooperation in these areas, in a manner consistent with the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development.
The availability of high-quality, accessible, timely and reliable demographic
data, disaggregated according to key characteristics of individuals, is essent ial for
planning and implementing policies and programmes in the follow -up to the
Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and
Development and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

work in the field of population during 2019. It covers the activities of the Division on
the analysis of global trends in fertility, mortality, migration, urbanization and
population ageing; the preparation of global population estimates and projections; the
monitoring of population policies; the analysis of interrelations between population
and sustainable development; the dissemination of population data and information;
technical cooperation with and capacity development provided to Member States; and
the support given to intergovernmental processes through the preparation of rep orts of
the Secretary-General and other parliamentary documents, the organization of expert
group meetings and the monitoring of internationally agreed development goals.
The objective of the programme of work in the field of population in the
biennium 2018–2019 was to strengthen the international community’s capacity to
effectively address current and emerging population issues and to integrate the
population dimension into the international development agenda. The Commission on
Population and Development acts as the governing body for the Population Division
and thus provides guidance on the work programme as part of its annual session.
The Commission may wish to take note of the report.

I. Introduction
The Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs is
responsible for the implementation of the programme of work on population of the
United Nations Secretariat. The programme of work is guided by the Programme of
Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, 1 by the
outcome of the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly on key actions for
the further implementation of the Programme of Action (resolution S-21/2, annex) and
by the decision of the Assembly to extend the Programme of Action and the key actions
for its further implementation beyond the original 20-year time horizon in 2014 (see
resolution 65/234). The outcomes of other relevant international conferences and
summits are also taken into account, including the United Nations Millennium
Declaration (resolution 55/2), the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), the
Declaration of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development
(resolution 68/4), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), the
New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) and the Global
Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (resolution 73/195). In addition, the
work of the Division is guided by the resolutions and decisions of the Commission on
Population and Development, in particular its resolution 2004/1 on the work
programme in the field of population (E/2004/25, chap. I, sect. B), and by other relevant
resolutions and decisions of the Assembly and of the Economic and Social Council.
As described in the biennial programme plan and priorities, the objective of the
work programme on population in the biennium 2018–2019 was to strengthen the
international community’s capacity to effectively address current and emerging
population issues and to integrate the population dimension into the international
development agenda (see A/71/6/Rev.1, programme 7, Economic and social affairs,
subprogramme 5, Population). The Commission provided intergovern mental
guidance and oversight.
The expected accomplishments for the subprogramme 5, Population, according
to the programme budget for the biennium 2018–2019 (see A/72/6 (Sect. 9),
subprogramme 5), were as follows:
Increased attention given to new and emerging population issues by the
international community and increased knowledge and understanding of the
interactions between population and development, including the gender dimensions
of demographic phenomena;
Effectively facilitate reviews by Member States and other stakeholders of
progress made in the further implementation of the Programme of Action of the
International Conference on Population and Development and of relevant instrume nts
of the United Nations development agenda, including the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
The Division collaborates closely with the agencies, funds and programmes and
other bodies of the United Nations system in implementing its work programme and
in supporting the follow-up to the International Conference on Population and
Development. United Nations offices and missions, national Governments, academic
researchers, media representatives and the public at large regularly consult with the
Division to obtain timely and pertinent data, information and analyses on population
patterns and trends and their connection with development issues.
The present report provides a summary of the activities and outputs of the
Division during 2019, which included the provision of support to intergovernmental

processes, the preparation of reports of the Secretary-General and other parliamentary
documents, the monitoring of internationally agreed development goals, the
dissemination of population data and information and technical cooperation. A list of
activities and outputs completed in 2019 is presented in the annex. Reference is also
made in the report to work in progress in 2019 that is expected to result in one or
more completed outputs in 2020.
II. Fertility and family planning
The Population Division completed World Fertility and Family Planning
Highlights 2020, 2 which presents trends in fertility and family planning, a discussion
on the interrelationship between contraception and fertility, and policy implications
for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. It also prepared two in -depth
reports, to be released in early 2020, on fertility among adolescents: the first providing
an examination of fertility among adolescents aged 15–19 years, and the second
presenting a first-time analysis of new data on the fertility of young adolescents
aged 10–14 years to enhance the evidence base in relation to indicator 3.7.2 of the
Goals. The Division released a factsheet on fertility among very young adolescents,
which offers an initial overview of levels of, and trends in, early adolescent fertility in
countries. 3
The Division released World Fertility Data 2019, a data set that builds on the
historical repository of demographic data and reports collected over more than
years by the Population Division and the Statistics Division. The data set includes
information derived from censuses, household surveys and civil registration systems,
as well as fertility estimates produced by the Division.
The Division published a comprehensive data set on family planning indicators,
World Contraceptive Use 2019, which includes survey-based estimates of
contraceptive prevalence and of unmet need for family planning among women of
reproductive age (from 15 to 49 years), disaggregated by age, marital status and
contraceptive methods used.
The Division used the information compiled in the data set World Contraceptive
Use 2019 to generate a comprehensive set of annual, model-based estimates and
projections of family planning indicators for the period from 1970 to 2030, published
as Estimates and Projections of Family Planning Indicators 2019. These two data
products provide information relevant for the national, regional and global monitoring
of Sustainable Development Goal indicator 3.7.1 (Proportion of women of
reproductive age (aged 15–49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied
with modern methods) (see E/CN.3/2016/2/Rev.1, annex IV).
The Division published a brief entitled “Global progress in satisfying the need
for family planning”, in which, in particular, it presents advances in the global
monitoring of progress towards meeting the need for family planning; discusses the
global progress made from 2000 to 2019 and which countries have experienced rapid
gains; and presents projections up to 2030.
The Division published two data booklets on family planning trends worldwide.
The booklet entitled Family Planning and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development presents global, regional and country progress in meeting the need for
family planning from 2000 to 2019 and the progress made towards ensuring, by 2030,
universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including family
To be released in January 2020.

planning, as specified in the target 3.7 of the Goals. The booklet entitled Contraceptive
Use by Method 2019 presents estimates of the prevalence of contraceptive use by
method based on data contained in the data set World Contraceptive Use 2019,
providing an assessment of the range and types of contraceptive methods used.
The Division prepared the 2019 update of the database World Marriage Data,
which provides comparable data on the marital status of the population, disaggregated
by age and sex, for 232 countries or areas of the world from about 1950 to 2019.
On 18 March 2019, the Division participated in a meeting of the technical
advisory group for estimates of pregnancies, abortions and pregnancy intentions
organized by the Guttmacher Institute and the World Health Organization (WHO) to
review the draft protocol for a study to produce global, regional and national modelbased estimates of incidences of abortion and unintended pregnancy and pregnancy
intentions, using the Division’s estimates of family planning indicators as inputs.
A research paper entitled “Forty years of fertility changes in the Sahel” was
accepted for publication in the journal Demographic Research. 4
III. Health and mortality
The Population Division completed the publication World Mortality 2019
Highlights, in which it summarized the patterns and levels of, and trends in, mortality
for the world and regions and for the 201 countries or areas with 90,000 inhabitants
or more in 2019. The data reviewed in the report are drawn from the latest
demographic estimates and projections as published in the 2019 Revision of World
Population Prospects. The report contains a review of trends in life expectancy at
birth and in child, adult and old-age mortality. The extent of improvements in survival
over the 25 years that have passed since the International Conference on Population
and Development is assessed, and progress towards the achievement of the related
Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda is reviewed. A more detailed report on world
mortality will be released in the first quarter of 2020.
The Division published the data booklet World Mortality 2019, in which key
indicators of mortality at the global, regional and country levels are presented. The
booklet highlights variations among countries in various mortali ty indicators: life
expectancy at birth by sex; under-5 mortality; and the probability of dying between
the ages of 15 and 60. Estimates of mortality are complemented by information on
the age distribution of deaths.
The Division issued an online data set containing tables from the World
Mortality Report. The tables provide estimates of life expectancy at birth, infant and
under-5 mortality, the probability of dying between the ages of 15 and 60 and between
birth and 60, and life expectancy at 60 by country and region for five-year periods
from 1950–1955 to 2015–2020. The Division also published an updated
comprehensive inventory of primary empirical data for the estimation of adult and
child mortality at the national level, Mortality Data Inventory 201 9. The data
inventory can be queried interactively through an online database. 5
The Division prepared a technical paper entitled “A sensitivity analysis of
parameters used in Spectrum’s Aids Impact Model: the role of the sex ratio of HIV
incidence and adult treatment on mortality levels and trends”.

In May 2019, the Division co-hosted an expert group meeting in New York on
methods and assumptions for demographic inputs to subnational modelling of
HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, organized by the Joint United Nations Programme
on HIV/AIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections.
IV. International migration
In 2019, the Population Division completed an annual update of the Global
Migration Database, bringing together all available information on the numbers of
international migrants (foreign-born or with foreign citizenship) residing in a country
or area, according to the national statistical office or other official source. The 2019
revision of the Database contains over 6,000 data tables for over 92 per cent of countries
and areas worldwide. With more than 8,700 registered users located in over 150
countries, the database has become an indispensable resource for migration researchers.
The Division used the updated Global Migration Database as a basis to develop
a new set of estimates of numbers, or stock, of international migrants, classified by
age group and sex and by countries of origin and destination, for 232 countries and
areas of the world since 1990. The 2019 revision of the International Migrant Stock
data set was released together with country profiles 6 and 10 key messages 7 on the
international migrant stock in September 2019. The Division published a brief entitled
“International migrants numbered 272 million in 2019, continuing an upward trend in
all major world regions”, which presents key findings from the 2019 revision of the
International Migrant Stock data set. In particular, it highlights recent changes in the
total number of international migrants, discusses the latest trends in their origin and
destination, presents up-to-date information on the global number and distribution of
refugees and summarizes gender and age dimensions of global migration.
The Division published a wallchart entitled International Migration 2019: Wall
Chart, which provides revised and updated estimates of international migrant stock
for 232 countries or areas. The publication is based on the latest data on international
migration from the 2019 revision of the International Migrant Stock data set.
The Division prepared International Migration Report 2019 and International
Migration Report 2019: Highlights, which contain analyses of the levels of, and trends
in, international migration, using the latest estimates and projections produced by the
Division. Estimates of international migrants by country of origin, destination, age and
gender are derived from the 2019 revision of the International Migrant Stock data set.
Estimates and projections of net migration are derived from the 2019 Revision of
World Population Prospects. The reports also contain summaries of migration policies
and programmes using data from the World Population Policies 2019: International
Migration Policies data set for 111 countries that responded to the international
migration module of the twelfth United Nations Inquiry among Governments on
Population and Development. Finally, the reports provide an overview of migrationrelated normative frameworks and legal instruments of the United Nations.
The Division contributed to the preparation of the 2020 edition of the
Department of Economic and Social Affairs flagship World Social Report by jointly
drafting a chapter titled “International migration: a force for equality, under the right
conditions”. In the chapter, the linkages between international migration and
inequalities, both within and among countries, are examined.

E/CN.9/2020/6
The Division organized an Expert Symposium on International Migration and
Development, 8 held at United Nations Headquarters on 26 February 2019. It was
convened in lieu of the annual coordination meeting on international migration, which
had been organized by the Division since 2001. The purposes of the symposium were to
highlight opportunities for addressing issues related to migration and development in the
high-level political forum on sustainable development, to discuss ways and means
of improving the collection and use of migration data and to share information on recent
initiatives on international migration and development. It was attended by more than
participants, including representatives of Member States, observers, United Nations
entities and regional commissions, non-governmental organizations and migration
experts. The report of the expert symposium is available online.
The Division served on the Executive Committee of the United Nations Network
on Migration. The Network, established by the Secretary-General in 2018, seeks to
ensure effective, timely and coordinated system-wide support for the implementation
of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The Division led the
working group aimed at developing and implementing a globa l programme to build
and enhance national capacities in data collection, analysis and dissemination. It also
served as a member of the working group aimed at establishing a connection hub and
knowledge platform, as mandated by the Global Compact. Both instruments will
ensure the design of demand-driven and tailor-made solutions to respond to migration
realities, drawing from a user-friendly open data source platform of existing evidence,
practices and initiatives.
V. Global population estimates and projections
In June 2019, the Population Division issued the 2019 Revision of World
Population Prospects, according to which the world’s population numbered nearly
7 billion in mid-2019 and is projected to increase to around 8.5 billion in 2030,
7 billion in 2050 and 10.9 billion in 2100. The results are based on the medium variant projection, which assumes a decline in fertility in countries where large families
are still prevalent and a slight increase in fertility in several low-fertility countries.
The preparation of the official United Nations population estimates and
projections for all countries and areas of the world is a key part of the work of the
Division. Such estimates and projections form a comprehensive set of demographic
data to assess population trends at the global, regional and national levels. They are
used in the calculation of many of the key development indicators commonly employed
by the United Nations system, including for more than one third of the indicators used
to monitor progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
They are used extensively by the general public and are widely considered to provide
the most authoritative set of demographic data describing pop ulation levels and trends
around the world. Several agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations
system distribute the results through their databases and websites.
The 2019 Revision presents population estimates from 1950 to the present for
countries or areas, as well as 250 major aggregates or groupings of countries or
areas, which have been developed through country-specific analyses of historical
demographic trends. In the latest assessment, the results of 1,690 national population
censuses conducted between 1950 and 2018 are considered, as well as information
from numerous vital registration systems and from 2,700 nationally representative
sample surveys.

E/CN.9/2020/6
The Division has continued to develop probabilistic population projections for
all countries and areas of the world up to the year 2100. Given the long projection
horizon, results at the country level are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The
attention of users was thus drawn not only to the outcomes of the medium variant,
which corresponds to the median of several thousand projected country trajectories
for each component, but also to the uncertainty intervals, which describe a range of
plausible outcomes. In addition, the 2019 Revision includes nine separate projection
variants that both convey the sensitivity of the medium -variant projection to changes
in the underlying assumptions and explore the implications of alternative future
scenarios of population change. The results of the probabilistic projections and nine
projection variants are available on the Division’s website. 9
Several outputs presenting the results of the 2019 Revision are available on the
Division’s website. A Highlights report contains summaries of key population trends
based on the new estimates and projections. 10 Detailed data for world regions, various
major aggregates 11 and countries and areas are available from the website in a variety
of formats, including Excel and ASCII file formats, an interactive database and two
PDF volumes (World Populations Prospects 2019: Volume I: Comprehensive Tables
and World Populations Prospects 2019: Volume II: Demographic Profiles). Supporting
materials, such as data sources and meta-information, are also available. 12 The site
also includes figures and maps illustrating the data. Additional publications from the
Revision include a wallchart 13 and a data booklet, 14 providing key demographic
indicators for all countries and areas of the world, and two Population Facts briefs in
which the results are analysed: “How certain are the United Nations global population
projections?” and “Potential impact of later childbearing on future population”. A
report entitled Methodology of the United Nations population estimates and
projections gives an overview of the data and methods used in the 2019 Revision.
VI. Population policies
In 2019, the Population Division completed the implementation of the twelfth
United Nations Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development. The
Inquiry, mandated by the General Assembly in 1962, is a long-standing survey used to
gather information from Governments on selected population policies and programmes,
for the purpose of monitoring progress towards the achievement of internationally
agreed development goals. The Inquiry documents changes in the views and policies of
Governments with respect to population size and growth, age structure, fertility,
reproductive health and family planning, health and mortality, spatial distribution and
internal migration and international migration within the context of demographic, social
and economic change. The twelfth Inquiry was repurposed to gather information for the
monitoring of progress on two Sustainable Development Goal indicators:
indicator 10.7.2 (Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration
policies) and indicator 5.6.2 (Number of countries with laws and regulations that
guarantee women aged 15–49 years access to sexual and reproductive health care,
information and education) (see section IX.D below). The Inquiry consists of multiple choice questions organized in three thematic modules: module I on population ageing
and urbanization; module II on fertility, family planning and reproductive health; and

module III on international migration. Modules I and II were implemented with support
from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and module III was implemented
in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) with support
from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The Division launched the World Population Policies 2019: International
Migration Policies and Programmes data set, which includes information from
Governments that responded to the international migration module of the twelfth
Inquiry. It also published the country profiles for International Migration Policies and
Programmes, 2019. Using the data, the Division prepared World Population Policies
2020: International Migration Policies Report and Highlights. 15 The reports describe
government policies and programmes related to international migration governance,
immigration, emigration, return migration, migrant rights, integration, trafficking in
persons and migrant smuggling, forced migration, migration and development and
diaspora engagement.
The Division launched the World Population Policies 2017: Abortion Laws and
Policies data set, which provides information on legal grounds for induced abortion,
requirements for induced abortion and access to abortion services in all 197 countries
of the world, including 193 Member States, 2 Observer States and 2 non-member
States of the United Nations. The data were gathered as part of the Global Abortion
Policies Project, carried out by the Division in collaboration with WHO. The Division
also published country profiles using the data. 16
VII. Urbanization and spatial distribution
In 2019, the Population Division released a report containing detailed analysis
of the results of the 2018 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects, containing the
latest estimates of the urban and rural populations of 233 countries or areas from 1950
to 2018 and projections to 2050, as well as estimates of population size from 1950 to
and projections to 2035, for nearly 1,900 urban settlements with 300,000
inhabitants or more in 2018. A Highlights version of the report was also released. 17
The Division prepared a technical paper entitled “Exposure and vulnerability to
natural disasters for world’s cities”, in which it used data from the 2018 Revision of
World Urbanization Prospects and spatial hotspot data to assess vulnerability to
cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and volcanic eruptions for cities
with 300,000 or more inhabitants in 2018.
VIII. Population ageing, household composition and
living arrangements
The Population Division released World Population Ageing 2019: Highlights.
The report provided an overview of global and regional trends of ageing, using both
conventional measures of population ageing, such as dependency ratios, and
innovative measurements of prospective ageing measurements. In the report, the
Division also examined ageing-relating economic indicators, including National
Transfer Accounts. The Highlights report was launched on International Day of Older
Persons, in October 2019. The Division also updated Profiles of Ageing 2019,
drawing on the 2019 Revision of World Population Prospects. A more detailed report
on world population ageing will be published in early 2020.
To be published in the first quarter of 2020.

E/CN.9/2020/6
In 2019, the Division updated the Database on the Living Arrangements of Older
Persons, which presents a compilation of indicators on the household composition
and living arrangements of persons aged 60 or over. The indicators are estimated
using both tabulated data and household roster microdata from cen suses and
household surveys. Indicators describe the proportion of older persons living alone,
with a spouse, with their children and in various configurations of intergenerational
households. The estimates included in the 2019 update are based on 738 uniq ue data
sources from 155 countries or areas, representing approximately 97 per cent of
persons aged 60 or over globally, with reference dates ranging from 1960 to 2018.
The Division also updated the Database on Household Size and Composition,
which presents a compilation of indicators on household size and composition around
the world, estimated using both tabulated data and household roster microdata from
censuses and household surveys. Indicators describe the distribution of households
by size, household headship, the percentage of households with members in certain
age groups, the prevalence of nuclear and extended family households and the
prevalence of various intergenerational household configurations. The estimates
included in the 2019 update are based on 814 unique data sources from 172 countries
or areas, representing approximately 97 per cent of the world’s population in 2019,
with reference dates ranging from 1960 to 2019.
The Division published a report in which it described global trends in households
and living arrangements, as well as the data and methods underlying the Database on
Household Size and Composition. In addition, it collaborated with the United Nations
Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) to develop
an extension of the Database that is focused on the households and living arrangements
of women. The extended data set informed chapter II of Progress of the world’s women
2019–2020, the theme of which is “Families in a changing world”.
The Division prepared a brief on living arrangements of older persons around
the world, 18 in which it summarized key findings from a recent analysis of the size
and composition of households with at least one older person, using the 2019 edition
of the Database on Household Size and Composition. On the occasion of the Group
of 20 meeting held in Japan, the Division published a fact sheet with 10 key findings
of ageing trends across Group of 20 member States. 19
The Division co-organized an expert group meeting on the topic of “Measuring
population ageing: bridging research and policy”, in cooperation with the
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and Chulalongkorn University,
Bangkok, in collaboration with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia an d
the Pacific (ESCAP). The meeting was held in Bangkok on 25 and 26 February
20 The report of the meeting is available online. 21
The Division supported the work of the Titchfield city group on ageing as a
member of the Steering Committee. The Group was established by the United Nations
Statistical Commission in 2018 to improve the availability, accessibility and
comparability of statistical data in support of ageing-related policymaking.

IX. Support for intergovernmental processes
A.
Reports of the Secretary-General
The Population Division prepared the report of the Secretary-General on the
theme of the fifty-second session of the Commission on Population and Development
in 2019, “Review and appraisal of the Programme of Action of the International
Conference on Population and Development and its contribution to the follow -up and
review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” ( E/CN.9/2019/2). The
report contains a review of the latest trends in population growth, fertility, family
planning and reproductive health, mortality, population ageing, urbanization and
human mobility, including international migration, in relation to development trends
and outcomes. Some general and specific contributions to the progress made in
achieving the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action and, in turn, its
contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda are reviewed, and include the
changing age distributions and their consequent enabling of the demographic
dividend, the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women and the
interrelationships among population, environment and climate change. The role of
demographic data in planning and monitoring is also discussed.
B.
Expert group meetings
On 16 and 17 September 2019, the Population Division held an expert group
meeting in preparation for the fifty-third session of the Commission on Population and
Development. At the meeting, experts from around the world examined new evidence
and analysis regarding relationships between population change, food security,
nutrition and sustainable development. Issues covered included: linkages to population
megatrends and components of change; connections between food securit y and
growth, consumption and sustainability; land degradation, water scarcity and
biosphere impacts; alternative scenarios for projected trends in population and food;
transformation of rural economies and employment as a driver of population
movements; synergies between population movements and rural development,
including migrant remittances and diaspora investments; consequences of malnutrition
for mortality and health, including reproductive health; and diets, nutritional habits
and burden of disease. The findings of the meeting are summarized in a report. 22
C.
Support for the General Assembly
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 73/241, the Population Division, in
collaboration with IOM and under the auspices of the United Nations Network on
Migration, assisted the Office of the President of the Assembly in preparing and
organizing the high-level debate on international migration and development, held on
February 2019. In particular, it facilitated the registration and participation of civil
society organizations, contributed to the preparation of the agenda and helped to
prepare the report.
The Division, in collaboration with IOM and under the auspices of the United
Nations Network on Migration, supported the informal consultations on the resolution
on the format and organizational aspects of the international migration review forums
(resolution 73/326). The consultations were conducted between February and July
The forums will serve as the primary intergovernmental global platform for

Member States to discuss and share progress on the implementation of all aspects of
the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, including in relation to
the 2030 Agenda.
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 73/303, the Division, in collaboration
with UNFPA, assisted the Office of the President of the Assembly in preparing an d
organizing a high-level event to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
International Conference on Population and Development, held on 16 July. In
particular, it facilitated the registration and participation of civil society organizations,
contributed to the preparation of the agenda and helped to prepare the report.
D.
Monitoring of internationally agreed development goals
The survey-based estimates of family planning indicators published in World
Contraceptive Use 2019, as well as the model-based estimates and projections of
those indicators, Estimates and Projections of Family Planning Indicators 2019,
informed the report of the Secretary-General on global progress towards the
Sustainable Development Goals in 2019, in particular with regard to target 3.7 on
ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health -care services, including
for family planning. The comprehensive data set and model-based estimates and
projections provide critical evidence regarding the degree to which the demand for
family planning is being met and whether that demand is being satisfied by the use of
modern methods of contraception (Sustainable Development Goal indicator 3.7.1).
The publications of the Division on contraceptive use and family plan ning are
widely used by organizations that work to improve sexual and reproductive health,
including global initiatives such as Family Planning 2020. Since 2014, the further
development of the Division’s work on family planning indicators has been supporte d
by extrabudgetary contributions from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. As a
result of that work, in 2019, for the first time, the global reporting of progress on
target 3.7 was based on estimates pertaining to all women of reproductive age and
was no longer restricted to women who were married or in a union.
As the custodian agency for indicator 3.7.2 of the Goals (Adolescent birth rate
(aged 10–14 years; aged 15–19 years) per 1,000 women in that age group), the
Division provided updates on the fertility rate for women aged 15–19 years, now
available for 221 countries or areas for the period from 2000 to 2018. For 217 of those
countries or areas, there are at least two data points available. 23 In order to provide
information also for the younger age group, the Division is reviewing available
census, survey and administrative data that can be used to estimate the adolescent
birth rate at the ages of 10–14 years.
The Division released the first data set 24 and country profiles 25 on
indicator 10.7.2 of the Goals (Number of countries that have implemented wellmanaged migration policies). The information on that indicator was available for
countries that responded to the international migration module of the twelfth
Inquiry. Indicator 10.7.2 informs target 10.7, which calls upon countries to facilitate
the orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including
through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies, which
is the target most explicitly and directly related to international migration among all
the targets of the 2030 Agenda. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs and

IOM are the custodian agencies for indicator 10.7.2, and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development is a partner agency.
The Division published a technical paper entitled “Development, validation and
testing of a methodology for SDG indicator 10.7.2 on migration policies”, in which
it describes the conceptual framework and provides an overview of the p rocess for
developing the methodology for measuring the indicator. It also published a policy
brief 26 and a data booklet 27 in which it summarized the global and regional situation
with regard to indicator 10.7.2 in 2019.
The Division contributed to the preparation of a data set on indicator 5.6.2 of
the Goals (Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee women aged
15–49 years access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and
education). The information for measuring that indicator was drawn from the fertility,
family planning and reproductive health module of the twelfth Inquiry, which is
implemented by the Division. UNFPA is the custodian agency for indicator 5.6.2, and
the Department of Economic and Social Affairs is a partner agency.
During 2019, the Division contributed to the work of the Inter-Agency Group
for Child Mortality Estimation, whose task is to monitor progress made towards the
achievement of target 3.2 of the Goals, on ending preventable deaths of newborns and
children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality
to no more than 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to no more than 25 per
1,000 live births. The Inter-Agency Group, led by the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) and WHO, also includes the Population Division and the World Bank. The
Division provided information to update the database on infant and under -5 mortality
estimates maintained by UNICEF 28 and collaborated in the preparation of the report
Levels and Trends in Child Mortality, published in 2019.
In addition, the Division continued to participate in the Maternal Mortality
Estimation Inter-agency Group, which is responsible for monitoring progress towards
the reduction of maternal mortality, which is target 3.1 of the Goals, on the reduction
of the global maternal mortality to fewer than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births. The
Inter-agency Group is led by WHO, with the participation of UNICEF, UNFPA, the
World Bank and the Population Division. The Division provides key inputs to the
maternal mortality estimation process, including country-level estimates of the
number of women of reproductive age, the total fertility rate and the number of live
births. It also contributed to the preparation of the report Maternal Mortality: Levels
and Trends, 2000–2017, published in 2019.
Throughout the year, the Division continued to participate in system -wide
consultations and reviews of Goal indicators under the auspices of the Inter-agency
and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators, including d iscussions
on options for indicators that are not yet clearly defined.
X. Dissemination of population information and data
To improve dissemination, all data sets and outputs from the latest revisions of
World Urbanization Prospects and World Population Prospects were made available
online through a web-based interface allowing users to download results in various
file formats through interactive queries. The website also contains key findings,
analytical charts and country profiles, as well as information on the methods used for

constructing the data set. According to information obtained from Google Analytics,
the website for the two products had about 2.4 million page views in 2019,
representing an increase of approximately 25 per cent since 2018, including more
than 1.7 million unique page views for World Population Prospects and
approximately 403,000 for World Urbanization Prospects. At the end of 2019,
according to information provided by Google, World Population Prospects was
referenced on 837,000 web pages (an increase of 8 per cent compared with 2018) and
was cited in 50,300 articles (an increase of 18 per cent), while World Urbanization
Prospects appeared on 280,000 web pages and in 30,300 articles (an increase of
per cent). The 2019 Revision was the first revision of World Population Prospects
published under a creative commons intergovernmental organizations licence .
The Division also contributes to more than 80 of the 1,600 indicators in the
World Development Indicators database of the World Bank, with a focus on
population dynamics and population structures, fertility, contraception, mortality,
migration and urbanization. The indicators were downloaded by up to 300,000
visitors in 2019, and four of them were among the top 10 most downloaded data.
The Division strengthened its communication and outreach activities,
collaborating closely with the Department of Global Communications and the
Strategic Planning and Communications Service of the Department of Economic and
Social Affairs in launching major publications and in publicizing major
intergovernmental events. In support of these launches and events, the Di vision
systematized its outreach activities by preparing key messages, media advisories,
press releases and social media packages, including digital cards, infographics, tweets
and Facebook posts. As a result, the number of requests for information and
interviews from media outlets increased sharply.
The Division promoted activities, findings and results related to the fifty -second
session of the Commission on Population and Development, which was held from
to 5 April.
On 17 June, the launch of the 2019 Revision of World Population Prospects was
carried out in close coordination with key partners, including regional economic
commissions, professional associations, research institutes and demographic centres.
National launch activities were held in Brazil, China, France, Germany, Japan and the
United States of America. In China, the launch was organized jointly with the China
Population Development and Research Center, involving a large number of
government officials and demographers, which generated considerable media
coverage. The launch of the World Population Prospects data and publications was
supplemented by an online document on frequently asked questions, a media kit and
a social media package. A trend analysis of search terms suggested that the media
coverage of the 2019 Revision of World Population Prospects was three to four times
greater than that of previous revisions.
On 17 September, the Division successfully launched the 2019 revision of
International Migrant Stock. The launch package included a revised set of estimates
of the number of international migrants by country of destination, origin, age and
gender, with accompanying documentation, a population fact sheet, a media kit and a
social media package.
The Division also expanded its outreach activities in support of the
commemoration of international days, in close collaboration with partner entities. In
particular, it produced relevant materials in the context of World Population Day
(11 July), International Youth Day (12 August), World Contraception Day
(26 September), the International Day of Older Persons (1 October), World Cities Day
(31 October) and International Migrants Day (18 December).

The Division incorporated a departmental strategic communication framework
and applied an accompanying visual ecosystem in both its traditional and online
publications.
Staff of the Division participated in meetings of professional associations in the
field of population, which provide a platform for dissemination of the Divis ion’s work
in academic circles. In 2019, staff gave presentations at, among others, the annual
meeting of the Population Association of America, held in Austin, United States, from
to 13 April, and the eighth African Population Conference, held in Enteb be,
Uganda, from 18 to 22 November.
During 2019, the Division continued to update and expand its website, which
provides access to timely population information for use by government officials,
academic researchers, the private sector and civil society. The website contains all the
publications issued by the Division in recent years and a full collection of documents
issued for and statements made in the Commission on Population and Development since
Web traffic statistics indicate that, in 2019, the Division’s website was visited by
an average of 97,000 unique users per month, generating some 4.3 million page views.
In 2019, the Division developed a new website that will be deployed in 2020.
The Division received many requests for data and pro vided such information in
a timely manner. In 2019, it continued to meet with delegations of Member States to
discuss various population-related topics, including the Division’s estimates and
projections of global population, the work of the Commission on Population and
Development, the follow-up to and review of the 2030 Agenda and the work of the
United Nations in the area of migration. It also provided numerous briefing notes and
statements for senior officials of the United Nations.
