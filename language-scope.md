# ELITR Test Set Language Scope

As outlined on http://elitr.eu/scope, ELITR needs to cover all EU and about 20
other languages, the official languages of EUROSAI member countries.

The following table lists all the languages jointly with their coverage in
InterCorp (https://intercorp.korpus.cz/) which includes manually-revised data parallel texts for many languages of our interest.

The numbers are thousands of words in the given language; Czech is the pivot but no text is counted twice.
